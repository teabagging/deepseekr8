Vasya noticed that if you insert a multiplication sign between the hundreds and tens places, the value of the resulting expression is a perfect square (18 × 18 = 324 = 18²). What is the next four-digit number after 1818 that has the same property?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where the teacher wrote the number 1818 on the board, and Vasya noticed that if you insert a multiplication sign between the hundreds and tens places, the value becomes a perfect square. Specifically, 18 × 18 equals 324, which is 18 squared. Now, the question is asking for the next four-digit number after 1818 that has the same property. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a four-digit number, say ABCD, where A, B, C, D are digits. If we insert a multiplication sign between the hundreds and tens places, it becomes AB × CD. In the case of 1818, AB is 18 and CD is 18, so 18 × 18 = 324, which is a perfect square. So, we need to find the next four-digit number after 1818 such that when we split it into the first two digits and the last two digits, their product is a perfect square.Alright, so the task is to find the smallest four-digit number greater than 1818 where the product of the first two digits and the last two digits is a perfect square. Let me denote the four-digit number as N, which is ABCD in digits. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. The product we're interested in is (10A + B) × (10C + D). This product should be a perfect square.Given that 1818 is the starting point, the next number we need to check is 1819, then 1820, and so on, until we find the next number where this property holds. However, checking each number one by one might be time-consuming, especially since we're dealing with four-digit numbers. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.Let me think about the structure of the number. The four-digit number can be split into two two-digit numbers: the first two digits (let's call this X) and the last two digits (let's call this Y). So, N = 100X + Y. The product X × Y should be a perfect square.So, we need to find the smallest N > 1818 such that X × Y is a perfect square, where X is the first two digits and Y is the last two digits of N.Given that N is a four-digit number, X can range from 10 to 99, and Y can range from 00 to 99. But since N is greater than 1818, X must be at least 18, and Y must be such that N = 100X + Y is greater than 1818.Wait, actually, X can be 18 or higher. Since 1818 is the starting point, the next number would have X starting from 18, but Y would be higher than 18. But if X increases, Y can reset to 00. So, perhaps the next number could be in the 1900s, 2000s, etc., but we need the smallest N after 1818.So, perhaps the next number is somewhere in the 1800s, but with Y higher than 18. Let's see.Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a mathematical equation. Let me denote X as the first two digits and Y as the last two digits. So, N = 100X + Y, and we need X × Y = k², where k is some integer.Our goal is to find the smallest N > 1818 such that X × Y is a perfect square. So, we can think of this as finding pairs (X, Y) where X is from 18 upwards, Y is from 00 upwards, and X × Y is a perfect square. Then, compute N = 100X + Y and find the smallest such N greater than 1818.Alternatively, perhaps we can express Y in terms of X. Since X × Y must be a perfect square, Y must be equal to (k²)/X, where k is an integer. So, Y = k² / X. Since Y must be an integer between 00 and 99, k² must be divisible by X, and the result must be between 00 and 99.Therefore, for each X starting from 18 upwards, we can find all k such that k² is divisible by X, and Y = k² / X is an integer between 00 and 99. Then, compute N = 100X + Y and check if it's greater than 1818. The smallest such N would be our answer.Alternatively, perhaps we can think of X and Y as factors of a perfect square. Since X × Y is a perfect square, X and Y must be such that in their prime factorizations, the exponents of each prime are even when combined. So, if X has a prime factorization of 2^a * 3^b * ..., then Y must have a prime factorization that complements X's exponents to make them even.This might be a bit abstract, but perhaps it can help us find possible pairs (X, Y). For example, if X is 18, which is 2 * 3², then Y must have a factor of 2 to make the exponent of 2 even. So, Y must be a multiple of 2. Additionally, since Y is a two-digit number, it can be 2, 4, 6, ..., 98. But in the case of 1818, Y is 18, which is 2 * 3², so when multiplied by X = 18, we get (2 * 3²) * (2 * 3²) = (2² * 3⁴) = (2 * 3²)² = 18², which is a perfect square.So, perhaps for other Xs, we can find Ys such that Y = (k²)/X, where k is an integer, and Y is a two-digit number.Let me try to formalize this. For each X starting from 18 upwards, compute the possible k such that k² is divisible by X, and Y = k² / X is a two-digit number (i.e., 00 ≤ Y ≤ 99). Then, compute N = 100X + Y and check if it's greater than 1818. The first such N we find would be our answer.Alternatively, perhaps we can iterate over possible k values and see if k² can be expressed as X × Y, where X and Y are two-digit numbers, and N = 100X + Y is greater than 1818.But this might be a bit time-consuming as well. Maybe we can find a pattern or a formula.Let me think about the properties of X and Y. Since X × Y is a perfect square, both X and Y must be such that their product has even exponents in their prime factorizations. Therefore, X and Y must be multiples of squares or have complementary factors.Alternatively, perhaps we can express X as a square times some factor, and Y as the same factor times another square. For example, if X = a² * m, then Y must be m * b², so that X × Y = a² * m * m * b² = (a * m * b)², which is a perfect square.This is similar to the concept of similar triangles or scaling factors. So, if we can write X as a² * m, then Y must be m * b², where m is some integer.Given that X is a two-digit number, m must be such that a² * m is a two-digit number. Similarly, Y = m * b² must also be a two-digit number.So, for each X, we can factor it into a² * m, where m is square-free (i.e., m has no square factors). Then, Y must be m * b², and since Y is a two-digit number, b² must be such that m * b² is less than 100.Alternatively, for each X, find its square-free part m, and then find b such that m * b² is a two-digit number. Then, Y = m * b², and N = 100X + Y.This seems like a promising approach. Let me try to apply this to X = 18.X = 18. The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3². So, the square-free part m is 2, since 3² is already a square. Therefore, Y must be m * b² = 2 * b². Since Y must be a two-digit number, 2 * b² must be between 10 and 99. So, b² must be between 5 and 49.5, meaning b can be from 3 to 7 (since 3²=9, 4²=16, 5²=25, 6²=36, 7²=49). Therefore, Y can be 18, 32, 50, 72, or 98.Wait, let's compute them:- b=3: 2*9=18- b=4: 2*16=32- b=5: 2*25=50- b=6: 2*36=72- b=7: 2*49=98So, Y can be 18, 32, 50, 72, or 98. Therefore, the four-digit numbers would be 1818, 1832, 1850, 1872, 1898. Since we're looking for the next number after 1818, the next one would be 1832. But let's check if 1832 satisfies the condition.Compute X × Y: 18 × 32 = 576. Is 576 a perfect square? Yes, because 24² = 576. So, 1832 is a candidate. But wait, is 1832 the next number after 1818 with this property? Or is there a smaller N between 1818 and 1832 that also satisfies the condition?Wait, 1818 is our starting point. The next number would be 1819, but we need to check if any number between 1819 and 1832 has this property. However, according to our earlier analysis, the next possible Y after 18 is 32, leading to N=1832. So, is 1832 the next such number?Wait, but perhaps there are other Xs beyond 18 that could result in a smaller N. For example, if X=19, can we find a Y such that 19 × Y is a perfect square, and N=1900 + Y is less than 1832? But 1900 is already greater than 1832, so N would be larger. Therefore, 1832 is indeed the next number.But hold on, let me verify this because sometimes there might be numbers with higher X but lower Y that result in a smaller N. For example, if X=19, Y= something, but N=1900 + Y, which is at least 1900, which is larger than 1832. Similarly, X=20, N=2000 + Y, which is even larger. So, 1832 is indeed the next number.But wait, let me check if 1832 is the correct next number or if there's another number between 1818 and 1832 that satisfies the condition. For example, 1820: X=18, Y=20. 18×20=360, which is not a perfect square. 1821: 18×21=378, not a square. 1822: 18×22=396, not a square. 1823: 18×23=414, not a square. 1824: 18×24=432, not a square. 1825: 18×25=450, not a square. 1826: 18×26=468, not a square. 1827: 18×27=486, not a square. 1828: 18×28=504, not a square. 1829: 18×29=522, not a square. 1830: 18×30=540, not a square. 1831: 18×31=558, not a square. 1832: 18×32=576, which is 24². So, yes, 1832 is the next number.But wait, let me think again. Is 1832 the next four-digit number after 1818 with this property? Or is there another number with a different X that is smaller than 1832 but greater than 1818?For example, if X=19, can we find a Y such that 19×Y is a perfect square, and N=1900 + Y is less than 1832? But 1900 is already larger than 1832, so N would be larger. Similarly, X=20 would lead to N=2000 + Y, which is even larger. So, no, 1832 is indeed the next number.But let me check another approach. Let's think about the product X × Y being a perfect square. So, for X=18, we have Y=18, 32, 50, 72, 98 as possible Ys. So, N=1818, 1832, 1850, 1872, 1898. So, the next one after 1818 is 1832.But wait, let me check if there's another X beyond 18, say X=20, and Y such that 20×Y is a perfect square, and N=2000 + Y is less than 1832. But 2000 is already larger than 1832, so no. Similarly, X=19, N=1900 + Y, which is larger than 1832.Therefore, 1832 is indeed the next number.But hold on, let me check if 1832 is correct. Let me compute 18 × 32: 18×32=576, which is 24². Yes, that's correct. So, 1832 is a valid number.But wait, is there a number between 1818 and 1832 that also satisfies this condition? For example, X=18, Y=19: 18×19=342, not a square. Y=20: 18×20=360, not a square. Y=21: 378, not a square. Y=22: 396, not a square. Y=23: 414, not a square. Y=24: 432, not a square. Y=25: 450, not a square. Y=26: 468, not a square. Y=27: 486, not a square. Y=28: 504, not a square. Y=29: 522, not a square. Y=30: 540, not a square. Y=31: 558, not a square. Y=32: 576, which is a square. So, yes, 1832 is the next number.But wait, let me think again. Maybe there's another X where X × Y is a perfect square, and N=100X + Y is between 1818 and 1832. For example, X=19, Y= something, but N=1900 + Y, which is larger than 1832. So, no. Similarly, X=17, but N=1700 + Y, which is less than 1818, so we don't consider that.Therefore, 1832 is the next number after 1818 with the desired property.But wait, let me check another angle. Maybe there's a number where X is not 18, but another two-digit number, such that X × Y is a perfect square, and N=100X + Y is between 1818 and 1832.For example, X=19, Y= something: 19×Y=k². Let's see, 19 is a prime number, so Y must be 19×m², where m is an integer. Since Y is a two-digit number, 19×m² ≤ 99. So, m² ≤ 99/19 ≈5.21. So, m can be 1 or 2. Therefore, Y=19×1=19 or Y=19×4=76. So, N=1919 or 1976. 1919 is greater than 1832, so it's not between 1818 and 1832.Similarly, X=20: 20×Y=k². 20=2²×5, so Y must be 5×m². Y must be two-digit, so 5×m² ≤99. So, m² ≤19.8. So, m can be 1,2,3,4. Therefore, Y=5,20,45,80. So, N=2005,2020,2045,2080. All of these are larger than 1832.X=17: 17×Y=k². 17 is prime, so Y=17×m². Y must be two-digit, so m² ≤5.82. So, m=1,2. Y=17,68. N=1717,1768. Both are less than 1818, so we don't consider them.X=16: 16×Y=k². 16 is 4², so Y must be a perfect square. Y can be 00,01,04,09,16,25,36,49,64,81. So, N=1600,1601,1604,1609,1616,1625,1636,1649,1664,1681. All less than 1818, so not relevant.X=15: 15×Y=k². 15=3×5, so Y must be 15×m². Y must be two-digit, so m² ≤6.6. m=1,2. Y=15,60. N=1515,1560. Both less than 1818.X=14: 14×Y=k². 14=2×7, so Y must be 14×m². Y must be two-digit, so m² ≤7.14. m=1,2. Y=14,56. N=1414,1456. Both less than 1818.X=13: 13×Y=k². 13 is prime, so Y=13×m². Y must be two-digit, so m² ≤7.69. m=1,2. Y=13,52. N=1313,1352. Both less than 1818.X=12: 12×Y=k². 12=2²×3, so Y must be 3×m². Y must be two-digit, so m² ≤33.33. m=1,2,3,4,5. Y=3,12,27,48,75. N=1203,1212,1227,1248,1275. All less than 1818.X=11: 11×Y=k². 11 is prime, so Y=11×m². Y must be two-digit, so m² ≤8.18. m=1,2. Y=11,44. N=1111,1144. Both less than 1818.X=10: 10×Y=k². 10=2×5, so Y must be 10×m². Y must be two-digit, so m² ≤9.9. m=1,2,3. Y=10,40,90. N=1010,1040,1090. All less than 1818.So, from this analysis, it seems that the next number after 1818 with the desired property is indeed 1832.But let me double-check by computing 18 × 32. 18 × 32: 18×30=540, 18×2=36, so 540+36=576. 576 is 24 squared, so yes, it's a perfect square.Therefore, the next four-digit number after 1818 with the property that inserting a multiplication sign between the hundreds and tens places results in a perfect square is 1832.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering that both X and Y must be such that their product is a square, so they must share common factors in a way that their combined exponents are even.Alternatively, perhaps we can think of X and Y as multiples of squares. For example, if X is a multiple of a square, say a², then Y must be a multiple of a² as well, but scaled by some factor.But I think the approach I took earlier is sufficient. By considering each X starting from 18, finding the possible Ys that make X × Y a perfect square, and then computing N, we can find the next number.So, to recap:1. Start with X=18.2. Find Y such that 18 × Y is a perfect square.3. The possible Ys are 18, 32, 50, 72, 98.4. The corresponding Ns are 1818, 1832, 1850, 1872, 1898.5. The next N after 1818 is 1832.Therefore, the answer should be 1832.But just to be thorough, let me check if there's any number between 1818 and 1832 where X is not 18, but another two-digit number, such that X × Y is a perfect square.For example, let's take X=19. As we saw earlier, Y can be 19 or 76, leading to N=1919 or 1976, both larger than 1832.X=20: Y=20,45,80, leading to N=2020,2045,2080, all larger.X=17: Y=17,68, leading to N=1717,1768, both smaller than 1818.X=16: Y=00,01,04,09,16,25,36,49,64,81, leading to N=1600,1601, etc., all smaller.Similarly, for X=15,14, etc., the Ns are smaller.Therefore, there are no numbers between 1818 and 1832 with this property, except for 1832 itself.Hence, the next four-digit number after 1818 with the desired property is 1832.**Final Answer**The next four-digit number after 1818 with the same property is boxed{1832}."},{"question":"Given sin (theta+kpi)=-2cos (theta+kpi)(kinmathbb{Z}), find the value of frac {4sin theta-2cos theta}{5cos theta +3sin theta }.","answer":"Okay, so I have this trigonometry problem here, and I need to find the value of the expression (frac{4sin theta - 2cos theta}{5cos theta + 3sin theta}). The given equation is (sin (theta + kpi) = -2cos (theta + kpi)) where (k) is an integer. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that trigonometric functions have periodicity, and adding (kpi) inside the sine and cosine functions will affect their signs depending on whether (k) is even or odd. Specifically, (sin(theta + kpi)) is equal to (sintheta) if (k) is even and (-sintheta) if (k) is odd. Similarly, (cos(theta + kpi)) is equal to (costheta) if (k) is even and (-costheta) if (k) is odd.But wait, the equation is given as (sin (theta + kpi) = -2cos (theta + kpi)). Let me consider both cases for (k) being even or odd.Case 1: (k) is even. Let's say (k = 2m) where (m) is an integer. Then, (sin(theta + 2mpi) = sintheta) and (cos(theta + 2mpi) = costheta). So the equation becomes:[sintheta = -2costheta]Which simplifies to:[sintheta + 2costheta = 0]Or:[sintheta = -2costheta]Case 2: (k) is odd. Let's say (k = 2m + 1). Then, (sin(theta + (2m + 1)pi) = -sintheta) and (cos(theta + (2m + 1)pi) = -costheta). So the equation becomes:[-sintheta = -2(-costheta)]Simplify the right side:[-sintheta = 2costheta]Multiply both sides by -1:[sintheta = -2costheta]Wait, so in both cases, whether (k) is even or odd, we end up with the same equation: (sintheta = -2costheta). That's interesting. So regardless of the value of (k), the relationship between (sintheta) and (costheta) is the same.So, from (sintheta = -2costheta), I can express (sintheta) in terms of (costheta). Let me write that down:[sintheta = -2costheta]Now, I can use this relationship to find the value of the given expression. The expression is:[frac{4sintheta - 2costheta}{5costheta + 3sintheta}]Since I have (sintheta = -2costheta), I can substitute (-2costheta) in place of (sintheta) in the numerator and denominator.Let's do that step by step.First, substitute into the numerator:[4sintheta - 2costheta = 4(-2costheta) - 2costheta]Calculate each term:[4(-2costheta) = -8costheta]So, the numerator becomes:[-8costheta - 2costheta = (-8 - 2)costheta = -10costheta]Now, substitute into the denominator:[5costheta + 3sintheta = 5costheta + 3(-2costheta)]Calculate each term:[3(-2costheta) = -6costheta]So, the denominator becomes:[5costheta - 6costheta = (5 - 6)costheta = -1costheta = -costheta]Now, putting the numerator and denominator together:[frac{-10costheta}{-costheta}]Simplify the expression. The negatives cancel out, and (costheta) cancels out as well (assuming (costheta neq 0), but let's check if that's a valid assumption later):[frac{-10costheta}{-costheta} = frac{10}{1} = 10]Wait, so the value of the expression is 10? Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Let me verify the steps:1. I considered both cases for (k) being even or odd and found that in both cases, (sintheta = -2costheta). That seems correct because adding (kpi) flips the sign of sine and cosine depending on whether (k) is even or odd, but in both cases, the equation simplifies to the same relationship.2. Then, I substituted (sintheta = -2costheta) into the given expression. That substitution seems correct.3. Calculated the numerator: (4sintheta - 2costheta = 4(-2costheta) - 2costheta = -8costheta - 2costheta = -10costheta). That looks right.4. Calculated the denominator: (5costheta + 3sintheta = 5costheta + 3(-2costheta) = 5costheta - 6costheta = -costheta). That also looks correct.5. Then, the fraction becomes (frac{-10costheta}{-costheta}). The negatives cancel, and (costheta) cancels, giving 10. That seems correct.But wait, I should check if (costheta) is zero because if (costheta = 0), then (sintheta = -2costheta = 0), which would mean both sine and cosine are zero, which isn't possible because (sin^2theta + cos^2theta = 1). So, (costheta) cannot be zero here. Therefore, it's safe to cancel (costheta).Another way to approach this problem is by using the identity (sintheta = -2costheta) to find the tangent of theta. Let me try that.From (sintheta = -2costheta), divide both sides by (costheta) (again, assuming (costheta neq 0)):[tantheta = -2]So, (tantheta = -2). That means theta is an angle whose tangent is -2. Now, perhaps I can express the given expression in terms of tangent.Let me write the expression again:[frac{4sintheta - 2costheta}{5costheta + 3sintheta}]I can factor out (costheta) from numerator and denominator:Numerator: (4sintheta - 2costheta = costheta(4tantheta - 2))Denominator: (5costheta + 3sintheta = costheta(5 + 3tantheta))So, the expression becomes:[frac{costheta(4tantheta - 2)}{costheta(5 + 3tantheta)} = frac{4tantheta - 2}{5 + 3tantheta}]Since (tantheta = -2), substitute that in:[frac{4(-2) - 2}{5 + 3(-2)} = frac{-8 - 2}{5 - 6} = frac{-10}{-1} = 10]Same result. So, that confirms the answer is indeed 10.Alternatively, I can think about this problem using the unit circle. If (sintheta = -2costheta), then the point (cosθ, sinθ) lies on the line y = -2x. The intersection of this line with the unit circle x² + y² = 1 will give the possible values of cosθ and sinθ.Let me solve this system:1. (y = -2x)2. (x^2 + y^2 = 1)Substitute equation 1 into equation 2:[x^2 + (-2x)^2 = 1]Simplify:[x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 implies 5x^2 = 1 implies x^2 = frac{1}{5} implies x = pm frac{1}{sqrt{5}}]Therefore, (x = frac{1}{sqrt{5}}) or (x = -frac{1}{sqrt{5}}). Then, (y = -2x) gives:- If (x = frac{1}{sqrt{5}}), then (y = -frac{2}{sqrt{5}})- If (x = -frac{1}{sqrt{5}}), then (y = frac{2}{sqrt{5}})So, the possible values are:- (costheta = frac{1}{sqrt{5}}), (sintheta = -frac{2}{sqrt{5}})- (costheta = -frac{1}{sqrt{5}}), (sintheta = frac{2}{sqrt{5}})Let me plug these into the expression to see if I get the same result.First case:(costheta = frac{1}{sqrt{5}}), (sintheta = -frac{2}{sqrt{5}})Numerator: (4sintheta - 2costheta = 4(-frac{2}{sqrt{5}}) - 2(frac{1}{sqrt{5}}) = -frac{8}{sqrt{5}} - frac{2}{sqrt{5}} = -frac{10}{sqrt{5}})Denominator: (5costheta + 3sintheta = 5(frac{1}{sqrt{5}}) + 3(-frac{2}{sqrt{5}}) = frac{5}{sqrt{5}} - frac{6}{sqrt{5}} = -frac{1}{sqrt{5}})So, the expression becomes:[frac{-frac{10}{sqrt{5}}}{-frac{1}{sqrt{5}}} = frac{10}{1} = 10]Second case:(costheta = -frac{1}{sqrt{5}}), (sintheta = frac{2}{sqrt{5}})Numerator: (4sintheta - 2costheta = 4(frac{2}{sqrt{5}}) - 2(-frac{1}{sqrt{5}}) = frac{8}{sqrt{5}} + frac{2}{sqrt{5}} = frac{10}{sqrt{5}})Denominator: (5costheta + 3sintheta = 5(-frac{1}{sqrt{5}}) + 3(frac{2}{sqrt{5}}) = -frac{5}{sqrt{5}} + frac{6}{sqrt{5}} = frac{1}{sqrt{5}})So, the expression becomes:[frac{frac{10}{sqrt{5}}}{frac{1}{sqrt{5}}} = frac{10}{1} = 10]Again, same result. So, regardless of the specific values of sine and cosine, the expression evaluates to 10.I think I've approached this problem from multiple angles: directly substituting, using the tangent identity, and even solving the unit circle equation. All methods lead me to the same conclusion that the value of the expression is 10.Just to recap, the key steps were:1. Recognizing that adding (kpi) to theta affects the signs of sine and cosine but ultimately leads to the same relationship (sintheta = -2costheta).2. Using this relationship to express sine in terms of cosine (or vice versa) and substituting into the given expression.3. Simplifying the expression, ensuring that (costheta neq 0) to avoid division by zero.4. Verifying the result using alternative methods to ensure consistency.So, after carefully working through the problem and checking my steps, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 10.**Final Answer**boxed{10}"},{"question":"To combat the mice, Leopold the cat must drink \\"ozverin\\" every day. He has a bottle of ozverin solution in water (colorless transparent liquid) with a volume of V=0.5 liters and an initial volumetric concentration of ozverin C_{0}=40%. Every day, Leopold drinks v=50 ml of the solution, and to avoid detection by the mice, he pours the same volume of water into the bottle. Find the volumetric concentration of ozverin in the bottle after the cat has drunk n=5 times v=50 ml of the liquid, with water being added back each time.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about Leopold the cat and his ozverin solution. Let me try to understand what's going on here. He has a bottle with 0.5 liters of solution, which is 40% ozverin. Every day, he drinks 50 ml of it, and then he adds back 50 ml of water to keep the volume the same. We need to find the concentration of ozverin after he does this 5 times. Hmm, okay.First, let me note down the given values:- Initial volume, V = 0.5 liters = 500 ml- Initial concentration, C₀ = 40% = 0.4- Volume drunk each day, v = 50 ml- Number of times he does this, n = 5So, every day, he removes 50 ml of the solution, which has some amount of ozverin in it, and then replaces it with 50 ml of water. This process dilutes the solution each time. I think this is a classic dilution problem, maybe similar to the wine-water mixing problems I've heard about.Let me think about how concentration changes each time he drinks and refills. Each time he drinks 50 ml, he's removing 50 ml of the current solution, which has a certain concentration of ozverin. Then he adds back 50 ml of water, which has 0% ozverin. So, the concentration should decrease each time, but by how much?Maybe I can model this step by step. Let's denote the concentration after k times as C_k. We start with C₀ = 0.4.After the first day:He drinks 50 ml, so the amount of ozverin he removes is 50 ml * C₀. Then he adds 50 ml of water, so the total volume remains 500 ml. The new concentration C₁ would be:C₁ = (Initial amount of ozverin - amount removed) / Total volumeSo, initial amount of ozverin is 500 ml * 0.4 = 200 ml.After removing 50 ml of solution, which has 50 ml * 0.4 = 20 ml of ozverin, the remaining ozverin is 200 - 20 = 180 ml. Then he adds 50 ml of water, so the total volume is still 500 ml. Therefore, C₁ = 180 / 500 = 0.36 or 36%.Okay, that makes sense. Now, for the second day:He drinks another 50 ml, which now has a concentration of 36%. So, the amount of ozverin removed is 50 ml * 0.36 = 18 ml. The remaining ozverin is 180 - 18 = 162 ml. Then he adds 50 ml of water, so the concentration becomes 162 / 500 = 0.324 or 32.4%.Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, the concentration is being multiplied by (1 - v/V). Let's check:After first day: 0.4 * (1 - 50/500) = 0.4 * 0.9 = 0.36After second day: 0.36 * 0.9 = 0.324Yes, that seems to be the case. So, each day, the concentration is multiplied by 0.9, which is (1 - 50/500) = 0.9.Therefore, after n days, the concentration would be C_n = C₀ * (1 - v/V)^nPlugging in the numbers:C₅ = 0.4 * (0.9)^5Let me calculate (0.9)^5:0.9^1 = 0.90.9^2 = 0.810.9^3 = 0.7290.9^4 = 0.65610.9^5 = 0.59049So, C₅ = 0.4 * 0.59049 ≈ 0.236196Converting that to percentage: 0.236196 * 100 ≈ 23.6196%So, approximately 23.62% concentration after 5 days.Wait, let me verify this with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Another way to think about it is using the formula for concentration after multiple dilutions:C_n = C₀ * (1 - v/V)^nYes, that's the same formula I used. So, plugging in the values again:C₀ = 0.4, v = 50, V = 500, n = 5C₅ = 0.4 * (1 - 50/500)^5 = 0.4 * (0.9)^5 ≈ 0.4 * 0.59049 ≈ 0.236196So, 23.62%. That seems consistent.Just to be thorough, let me calculate it step by step for each day:Day 1:C₁ = 0.4 * 0.9 = 0.36Day 2:C₂ = 0.36 * 0.9 = 0.324Day 3:C₃ = 0.324 * 0.9 = 0.2916Day 4:C₄ = 0.2916 * 0.9 = 0.26244Day 5:C₅ = 0.26244 * 0.9 = 0.236196Yes, same result. So, 23.6196%, which we can round to 23.62%.Therefore, the volumetric concentration of ozverin after 5 days is approximately 23.62%.**Final Answer**The volumetric concentration of ozverin after 5 days is boxed{23.62%}."},{"question":"Let n be a positive integer and d be a digit such that the value of the numeral underline{32d} in base n equals 263, and the value of the numeral underline{324} in base n equals the value of the numeral underline{11d1} in base six. What is n + d ?textbf{(A)} ~10 qquadtextbf{(B)} ~11 qquadtextbf{(C)} ~13 qquadtextbf{(D)} ~15 qquadtextbf{(E)} ~16","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of ( n + d ) given some conditions about numerals in different bases. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the problem says that the numeral ( underline{32d} ) in base ( n ) equals 263 in decimal. Then, it also says that the numeral ( underline{324} ) in base ( n ) equals the numeral ( underline{11d1} ) in base six. I need to find ( n + d ).Alright, let's tackle the first part: ( underline{32d}_n = 263_{10} ).In base ( n ), the numeral ( underline{32d} ) represents:- The first digit from the right is the units place, which is ( d times n^0 = d times 1 = d ).- The middle digit is the ( n ) place, which is ( 2 times n^1 = 2n ).- The leftmost digit is the ( n^2 ) place, which is ( 3 times n^2 ).So, adding them up, the value in decimal is ( 3n^2 + 2n + d ). And this equals 263.So, equation one is:( 3n^2 + 2n + d = 263 )  ...(1)Okay, that's the first equation.Now, the second part: ( underline{324}_n = underline{11d1}_6 ).Let me convert both sides to decimal and set them equal.First, ( underline{324}_n ):- The digits are 3, 2, 4 from left to right.- So, in base ( n ), this is ( 3 times n^2 + 2 times n + 4 times 1 ).So, ( 3n^2 + 2n + 4 ).Now, ( underline{11d1}_6 ):- The digits are 1, 1, d, 1 from left to right.- In base 6, this is ( 1 times 6^3 + 1 times 6^2 + d times 6 + 1 times 1 ).Calculating that:( 1 times 216 + 1 times 36 + d times 6 + 1 times 1 = 216 + 36 + 6d + 1 = 253 + 6d ).So, the second equation is:( 3n^2 + 2n + 4 = 253 + 6d )  ...(2)Alright, so now I have two equations:1. ( 3n^2 + 2n + d = 263 )2. ( 3n^2 + 2n + 4 = 253 + 6d )Hmm, maybe I can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) or something like that to eliminate some variables.Wait, let me see:Equation (1): ( 3n^2 + 2n + d = 263 )Equation (2): ( 3n^2 + 2n + 4 = 253 + 6d )If I subtract equation (1) from equation (2), I get:( (3n^2 + 2n + 4) - (3n^2 + 2n + d) = (253 + 6d) - 263 )Simplify:Left side: ( 3n^2 - 3n^2 + 2n - 2n + 4 - d = 4 - d )Right side: ( 253 - 263 + 6d = -10 + 6d )So, equation becomes:( 4 - d = -10 + 6d )Let me solve for ( d ):Bring ( d ) to the right and constants to the left:( 4 + 10 = 6d + d )( 14 = 7d )So, ( d = 2 ).Okay, so ( d = 2 ). Now, let's plug this back into equation (1) to find ( n ).Equation (1): ( 3n^2 + 2n + d = 263 )Substitute ( d = 2 ):( 3n^2 + 2n + 2 = 263 )Subtract 263 from both sides:( 3n^2 + 2n + 2 - 263 = 0 )Simplify:( 3n^2 + 2n - 261 = 0 )So, quadratic equation: ( 3n^2 + 2n - 261 = 0 )Let me try to solve this quadratic equation. Maybe factor it or use quadratic formula.Quadratic formula: ( n = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Here, ( a = 3 ), ( b = 2 ), ( c = -261 )Compute discriminant:( b^2 - 4ac = 4 - 4*3*(-261) = 4 + 12*261 )Compute 12*261:12*200=2400, 12*60=720, 12*1=12. So, 2400+720=3120+12=3132.So, discriminant is 4 + 3132 = 3136.Square root of 3136: Let me see, 56^2 is 3136 because 50^2=2500, 60^2=3600, so 56^2=3136.So, sqrt(3136)=56.Thus,( n = frac{-2 pm 56}{6} )We can discard the negative solution because ( n ) is a positive integer.So,( n = frac{-2 + 56}{6} = frac{54}{6} = 9 )Alternatively,( n = frac{-2 - 56}{6} = frac{-58}{6} ), which is negative, so we ignore it.So, ( n = 9 ).Wait, so ( n = 9 ) and ( d = 2 ). Therefore, ( n + d = 9 + 2 = 11 ).But wait, let me double-check because sometimes when dealing with bases, the digits have to be less than the base.In the numeral ( underline{32d}_n ), the digits are 3, 2, and d. So, each digit must be less than base ( n ). So, 3 < n, 2 < n, and d < n. Since d = 2, so 2 < n, which is okay because n = 9, which is greater than 2.Similarly, in the numeral ( underline{324}_n ), the digits are 3, 2, 4. So, 4 must be less than n. Since n = 9, 4 < 9, which is fine.In the numeral ( underline{11d1}_6 ), the digits are 1, 1, d, 1. Since the base is 6, each digit must be less than 6. d = 2, which is less than 6, so that's okay.So, all digits are valid in their respective bases.Let me verify the first condition:( underline{32d}_n = underline{322}_9 ). Let's compute its decimal value:3*9^2 + 2*9 + 2 = 3*81 + 18 + 2 = 243 + 18 + 2 = 263. Yes, that's correct.Now, the second condition:( underline{324}_9 ) should equal ( underline{11d1}_6 ).Compute ( underline{324}_9 ):3*81 + 2*9 + 4 = 243 + 18 + 4 = 265.Compute ( underline{11d1}_6 ) with d=2:1*6^3 + 1*6^2 + 2*6 + 1 = 1*216 + 1*36 + 12 + 1 = 216 + 36 + 12 + 1 = 265.Yes, that's correct as well.So, both conditions are satisfied with ( n = 9 ) and ( d = 2 ). Therefore, ( n + d = 11 ).Looking at the options, B is 11, so the answer is B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Find all such three-digit numbers that, when increased by 3, the sum of their digits is reduced to one-third of the original sum.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: Find all three-digit numbers such that when you increase the number by 3, the sum of its digits is reduced to one-third of the original sum. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, let's denote the three-digit number as ABC, where A, B, and C are its digits. So, the number itself is 100*A + 10*B + C. The sum of its digits is A + B + C. Let's call this sum S. So, S = A + B + C.According to the problem, when we add 3 to this number, the sum of the digits becomes S/3. So, the new number is ABC + 3, and the sum of its digits is (A + B + C)/3.Wait, but adding 3 to a number can affect its digits in different ways. For example, if the last digit is 7, adding 3 would make it 10, which would carry over to the tens place. Similarly, if the tens digit is 9, adding 3 could cause a carryover to the hundreds place. So, I need to consider these cases.Let me think about how adding 3 affects the digits. Let's denote the original number as N = 100A + 10B + C. Then, N + 3 = 100A' + 10B' + C', where A', B', C' are the digits of the new number. The sum of the digits after adding 3 is A' + B' + C' = S/3.So, the key is to find all N such that when you add 3, the digit sum becomes one-third of the original digit sum.Let me consider the possible cases based on the value of C (the units digit):Case 1: C + 3 < 10. That is, adding 3 doesn't cause a carryover. In this case, the units digit becomes C + 3, and the tens and hundreds digits remain the same. So, the new digit sum is (A) + (B) + (C + 3) = S + 3. But according to the problem, this should be equal to S/3. So, we have:S + 3 = S/3Let me solve this equation:Multiply both sides by 3: 3S + 9 = SSubtract S: 2S + 9 = 0This gives 2S = -9, which is impossible because S is the sum of digits, which must be a positive integer. So, this case doesn't yield any solutions.Case 2: C + 3 >= 10. That is, adding 3 causes a carryover to the tens place. So, the units digit becomes (C + 3) - 10, and the tens digit increases by 1. But now, we have to check if adding 1 to the tens digit causes another carryover.Subcase 2a: B + 1 < 10. So, the tens digit becomes B + 1, and the hundreds digit remains A. The new number is 100A + 10*(B + 1) + (C + 3 - 10). The digit sum is A + (B + 1) + (C - 7) = A + B + 1 + C - 7 = S - 6.According to the problem, this should be equal to S/3. So:S - 6 = S/3Multiply both sides by 3: 3S - 18 = SSubtract S: 2S - 18 = 0 => 2S = 18 => S = 9.So, in this subcase, the original digit sum must be 9. Let's see what numbers satisfy this.We have C + 3 >= 10, so C >= 7. Also, B + 1 < 10, so B <= 8.So, the original number is ABC, where A is from 1 to 9, B from 0 to 8, and C from 7 to 9, with A + B + C = 9.Let me list all possible combinations where A + B + C = 9, with A >=1, B <=8, C >=7.Let me fix C first:C = 7: Then A + B = 2. Since A >=1, B can be 1 or 0.Wait, A + B = 2. So, possible (A, B):(1,1), (2,0). But B must be <=8, which is satisfied.So, numbers:1 1 7: 1172 0 7: 207C = 8: Then A + B = 1. Since A >=1, B must be 0.So, number:1 0 8: 108C = 9: Then A + B = 0. But A >=1, which is impossible. So, no numbers here.So, from Subcase 2a, we have numbers: 117, 207, 108.Wait, let me check 108: adding 3 gives 111. The digit sum of 108 is 1+0+8=9, and the digit sum of 111 is 1+1+1=3, which is indeed 9/3=3. So, that works.Similarly, 117 + 3 = 120. Digit sum of 117 is 1+1+7=9, digit sum of 120 is 1+2+0=3. Correct.207 + 3 = 210. Digit sum of 207 is 2+0+7=9, digit sum of 210 is 2+1+0=3. Correct.Okay, so these are valid.Subcase 2b: B + 1 >= 10. That is, adding 1 to B causes another carryover to the hundreds place. So, the tens digit becomes (B + 1) - 10, and the hundreds digit increases by 1.So, the new number is 100*(A + 1) + 10*(B + 1 - 10) + (C + 3 - 10). Simplify:100*(A + 1) + 10*(B - 9) + (C - 7)The digit sum is (A + 1) + (B - 9) + (C - 7) = A + 1 + B - 9 + C - 7 = A + B + C - 15 = S - 15.According to the problem, this should be equal to S/3:S - 15 = S/3Multiply both sides by 3: 3S - 45 = SSubtract S: 2S - 45 = 0 => 2S = 45 => S = 22.5But S must be an integer, so this case doesn't yield any solutions.Wait, but S is the sum of digits, so it must be an integer. So, 22.5 is not possible. Therefore, Subcase 2b has no solutions.So, from Case 2, only Subcase 2a gives us solutions: 108, 117, 207.Wait, but let me think again. When adding 3 causes a carryover in the tens digit, we considered both subcases where B + 1 < 10 and B + 1 >=10. But in Subcase 2b, S = 22.5 is not possible, so no solutions there.But wait, is there another case where adding 3 causes two carryovers? For example, if C = 9, adding 3 would make it 12, so units digit becomes 2, and carryover 1 to tens. Then, if B = 9, adding 1 would make it 10, so tens digit becomes 0, carryover 1 to hundreds. Then, if A = 9, adding 1 would make it 10, so hundreds digit becomes 0, carryover 1 to thousands, but since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, this would make it a four-digit number, which is beyond our scope.But in our problem, N is a three-digit number, so N + 3 can be a four-digit number only if N = 997, 998, 999. Let's check if these are possible.Wait, let's see if N = 997. Then N + 3 = 1000. The digit sum of 997 is 9 + 9 + 7 = 25. The digit sum of 1000 is 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1. Is 1 equal to 25 / 3? 25 / 3 ≈ 8.333, which is not 1. So, that doesn't work.Similarly, N = 998: digit sum is 9 + 9 + 8 = 26. N + 3 = 1001, digit sum is 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2. 26 / 3 ≈ 8.666, not 2.N = 999: digit sum is 27. N + 3 = 1002, digit sum is 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 3. 27 / 3 = 9, but 3 ≠ 9. So, that doesn't work either.Therefore, even if adding 3 causes two carryovers, it doesn't lead to a valid solution.So, so far, we have three numbers: 108, 117, 207.Wait, but let me check another case where adding 3 causes carryover in both tens and units digits, but without making it a four-digit number. For example, if the number is 199. Adding 3 would make it 202. The digit sum of 199 is 1 + 9 + 9 = 19. The digit sum of 202 is 2 + 0 + 2 = 4. Is 4 equal to 19 / 3? 19 / 3 ≈ 6.333, which is not 4. So, that doesn't work.Wait, but in this case, adding 3 to 199 causes two carryovers: 9 + 3 = 12, so units digit becomes 2, carryover 1 to tens. Then, tens digit is 9 + 1 = 10, so tens digit becomes 0, carryover 1 to hundreds. Hundreds digit becomes 1 + 1 = 2. So, digit sum is 2 + 0 + 2 = 4.But 4 is not equal to 19 / 3, so it doesn't satisfy the condition.Wait, but in this case, the digit sum decreased by 15 (from 19 to 4). But according to our earlier equation, S - 15 = S / 3, which would require S = 22.5, which is not possible. So, this case doesn't yield a solution.Therefore, the only solutions are from Subcase 2a: 108, 117, 207.Wait, but let me check another example. Let's say N = 297. Digit sum is 2 + 9 + 7 = 18. N + 3 = 300. Digit sum is 3 + 0 + 0 = 3. 3 is equal to 18 / 3 = 6? Wait, no, 3 ≠ 6. So, that doesn't work.Wait, so 297 + 3 = 300. Digit sum goes from 18 to 3, which is a reduction by 15, but 3 is not equal to 18 / 3 = 6. So, that doesn't satisfy the condition.Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, in Subcase 2b, we had S - 15 = S / 3, which would require S = 22.5, which is not possible. So, that's why 297 doesn't work.Wait, but let me check another number. Let's say N = 396. Digit sum is 3 + 9 + 6 = 18. N + 3 = 399. Digit sum is 3 + 9 + 9 = 21. 21 is not equal to 18 / 3 = 6. So, that doesn't work.Wait, but in this case, adding 3 didn't cause a carryover in the tens digit because 6 + 3 = 9, which doesn't carryover. So, the digit sum increased by 3, which doesn't fit our condition.Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, when adding 3 doesn't cause a carryover, the digit sum increases by 3, which would require S + 3 = S / 3, which is impossible. So, that's why such numbers don't work.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed some cases.Wait, another scenario: when adding 3 causes a carryover in the units digit, but the tens digit is 9, so adding 1 makes it 10, which causes another carryover. So, for example, N = 199. Adding 3 gives 202. Digit sum goes from 19 to 4. As before, 4 ≠ 19 / 3.But according to our earlier analysis, this would require S - 15 = S / 3, which is S = 22.5, not possible.Wait, but let me check N = 297. Digit sum is 18. N + 3 = 300, digit sum 3. 3 ≠ 6.Wait, but 18 / 3 = 6, but digit sum is 3. So, that's not equal.Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in my earlier analysis. Let me re-examine.In Subcase 2b, when adding 3 causes two carryovers, the digit sum becomes S - 15. So, S - 15 = S / 3.So, 3S - 45 = S => 2S = 45 => S = 22.5. Since S must be integer, no solution.Therefore, no numbers in this case.Wait, but let me check N = 399. Digit sum is 3 + 9 + 9 = 21. N + 3 = 402. Digit sum is 4 + 0 + 2 = 6. 6 is equal to 21 / 3 = 7? Wait, 21 / 3 is 7, but 6 ≠ 7. So, that doesn't work.Wait, but 21 / 3 is 7, but the new digit sum is 6. So, that's not equal.Wait, but let me calculate S - 15: 21 - 15 = 6, which is indeed equal to 21 / 3 = 7? Wait, no, 6 ≠ 7. So, that doesn't satisfy the condition.Wait, so in this case, S - 15 = 6, which is not equal to S / 3 = 7. So, that doesn't work.Wait, but according to our equation, S - 15 = S / 3, which would require S = 22.5, which is not possible. So, that's why.Therefore, the only solutions are from Subcase 2a: 108, 117, 207.Wait, but let me check another number. Let's say N = 189. Digit sum is 1 + 8 + 9 = 18. N + 3 = 192. Digit sum is 1 + 9 + 2 = 12. 12 is not equal to 18 / 3 = 6. So, that doesn't work.Wait, but in this case, adding 3 caused a carryover in the units digit (9 + 3 = 12), so units digit becomes 2, carryover 1 to tens. Tens digit was 8, becomes 9, no further carryover. So, digit sum becomes 1 + 9 + 2 = 12. 12 ≠ 6.Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, in Subcase 2a, the digit sum becomes S - 6. So, 18 - 6 = 12, which is correct. But 12 ≠ 18 / 3 = 6. So, that doesn't satisfy the condition.Wait, but in our earlier analysis, we had S - 6 = S / 3, which led to S = 9. So, only numbers with S = 9 satisfy this condition.Therefore, only numbers where the original digit sum is 9, and adding 3 causes a carryover in the units digit but not in the tens digit, will satisfy the condition.So, that's why we only have 108, 117, 207.Wait, let me check another number with S = 9. For example, N = 180. Digit sum is 1 + 8 + 0 = 9. N + 3 = 183. Digit sum is 1 + 8 + 3 = 12. 12 ≠ 3. So, that doesn't work.Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, adding 3 to 180 would cause a carryover in the units digit (0 + 3 = 3, no carryover). Wait, no, 0 + 3 = 3, so no carryover. So, the digit sum would be 1 + 8 + 3 = 12, which is S + 3 = 12, which is not equal to S / 3 = 3. So, that doesn't work.Wait, but in this case, adding 3 didn't cause a carryover, so it's Case 1, which we already saw has no solutions.So, only numbers where adding 3 causes a carryover in the units digit, but not in the tens digit, and the original digit sum is 9, will satisfy the condition.Therefore, the only numbers are 108, 117, and 207.Wait, let me check 207: 2 + 0 + 7 = 9. Adding 3 gives 210, digit sum 2 + 1 + 0 = 3, which is 9 / 3 = 3. Correct.Similarly, 117: 1 + 1 + 7 = 9. Adding 3 gives 120, digit sum 1 + 2 + 0 = 3. Correct.108: 1 + 0 + 8 = 9. Adding 3 gives 111, digit sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Correct.So, these three numbers satisfy the condition.Wait, but let me check another number with S = 9. For example, N = 126. Digit sum is 1 + 2 + 6 = 9. Adding 3 gives 129. Digit sum is 1 + 2 + 9 = 12. 12 ≠ 3. So, that doesn't work.Wait, but in this case, adding 3 didn't cause a carryover in the units digit because 6 + 3 = 9, which doesn't carryover. So, the digit sum increased by 3, which is not equal to S / 3.Therefore, only numbers where adding 3 causes a carryover in the units digit, but not in the tens digit, and S = 9, will satisfy the condition.So, the only numbers are 108, 117, and 207.Wait, but let me check another number: N = 171. Digit sum is 1 + 7 + 1 = 9. Adding 3 gives 174. Digit sum is 1 + 7 + 4 = 12. 12 ≠ 3. So, that doesn't work.Wait, because adding 3 didn't cause a carryover in the units digit (1 + 3 = 4). So, digit sum increased by 3, which doesn't satisfy the condition.Therefore, only numbers where adding 3 causes a carryover in the units digit, but not in the tens digit, and S = 9, will satisfy the condition.So, the only numbers are 108, 117, and 207.Wait, let me check another number: N = 207. As before, it works.Wait, N = 108: works.N = 117: works.Is there another number with S = 9 where adding 3 causes a carryover in the units digit but not in the tens digit?Let me see: C must be >=7, so that C + 3 >=10.So, C can be 7, 8, or 9.If C = 7, then A + B = 2.Possible (A, B):A =1, B=1: 117A=2, B=0: 207C=8: A + B =1.Possible (A, B):A=1, B=0: 108C=9: A + B=0: Not possible since A >=1.So, that's all.Therefore, the only numbers are 108, 117, 207.Wait, but let me check another number: N = 306. Digit sum is 3 + 0 + 6 = 9. Adding 3 gives 309. Digit sum is 3 + 0 + 9 = 12. 12 ≠ 3. So, that doesn't work.Wait, because adding 3 didn't cause a carryover in the units digit (6 + 3 = 9). So, digit sum increased by 3, which doesn't satisfy the condition.Therefore, only numbers where adding 3 causes a carryover in the units digit, but not in the tens digit, and S = 9, will satisfy the condition.So, the only numbers are 108, 117, and 207.I think that's all. Let me just list them again:108: 1 + 0 + 8 = 9; 108 + 3 = 111; 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 = 9 / 3.117: 1 + 1 + 7 = 9; 117 + 3 = 120; 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 = 9 / 3.207: 2 + 0 + 7 = 9; 207 + 3 = 210; 2 + 1 + 0 = 3 = 9 / 3.Yes, these all satisfy the condition.I don't think there are any other numbers that fit this criterion. So, the final answer should be these three numbers: 108, 117, and 207."},{"question":"What is the largest integer ( k ) whose square ( k^2 ) is a factor of ( 10! )?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: What is the largest integer ( k ) whose square ( k^2 ) is a factor of ( 10! ). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on factorials and prime factors, but I think I can work through it.First, I remember that ( 10! ) means 10 factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to 10. So, ( 10! = 10 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 ). But calculating that directly might not be the best approach here. Instead, I think I need to find the prime factorization of ( 10! ) because that will help me determine the largest ( k ) such that ( k^2 ) divides ( 10! ).Alright, so let's start by finding the prime factors of each number from 1 to 10 and then combine them to get the prime factorization of ( 10! ).Starting with 10: The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5.9: That's ( 3^2 ).8: That's ( 2^3 ).7: That's a prime number, so just 7.6: That's 2 and 3.5: That's a prime number, so just 5.4: That's ( 2^2 ).3: That's a prime number, so just 3.2: That's a prime number, so just 2.1: Doesn't contribute any prime factors.Now, let's list out all the prime factors:- 2: From 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2. Let's count how many times 2 appears.10 contributes one 2.8 contributes three 2s.6 contributes one 2.4 contributes two 2s.2 contributes one 2.So total number of 2s: 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8.- 3: From 9, 6, and 3.9 contributes two 3s.6 contributes one 3.3 contributes one 3.Total number of 3s: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.- 5: From 10 and 5.Each contributes one 5.Total number of 5s: 1 + 1 = 2.- 7: From 7, contributes one 7.Total number of 7s: 1.So, putting it all together, the prime factorization of ( 10! ) is:( 2^8 times 3^4 times 5^2 times 7^1 ).Okay, now that I have the prime factors, I need to find the largest integer ( k ) such that ( k^2 ) divides ( 10! ). I remember that if ( k^2 ) divides ( 10! ), then the exponents in the prime factorization of ( k^2 ) must be less than or equal to the exponents in the prime factorization of ( 10! ).Since ( k^2 ) is a square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even numbers. So, to find the largest ( k ), I need to take the largest possible exponents for each prime factor in ( k^2 ) such that they don't exceed the exponents in ( 10! ).Let me think about this. For each prime factor, the exponent in ( k^2 ) must be an even number less than or equal to the exponent in ( 10! ).So, for prime 2: exponent in ( 10! ) is 8. The largest even number less than or equal to 8 is 8 itself. So, exponent for 2 in ( k^2 ) is 8.For prime 3: exponent in ( 10! ) is 4. The largest even number less than or equal to 4 is 4. So, exponent for 3 in ( k^2 ) is 4.For prime 5: exponent in ( 10! ) is 2. The largest even number less than or equal to 2 is 2. So, exponent for 5 in ( k^2 ) is 2.For prime 7: exponent in ( 10! ) is 1. The largest even number less than or equal to 1 is 0. So, exponent for 7 in ( k^2 ) is 0, which means 7 doesn't appear in ( k^2 ).Therefore, the prime factorization of ( k^2 ) is ( 2^8 times 3^4 times 5^2 ).But wait, ( k^2 ) is ( (k)^2 ), so to find ( k ), we take the square root of each exponent in ( k^2 ). That is, for each prime, the exponent in ( k ) is half the exponent in ( k^2 ).So, exponent of 2 in ( k ) is 8 / 2 = 4.Exponent of 3 in ( k ) is 4 / 2 = 2.Exponent of 5 in ( k ) is 2 / 2 = 1.Exponent of 7 in ( k ) is 0 / 2 = 0.So, the prime factorization of ( k ) is ( 2^4 times 3^2 times 5^1 ).Now, let's compute the value of ( k ):( 2^4 = 16 )( 3^2 = 9 )( 5^1 = 5 )Multiplying these together: 16 * 9 = 144; 144 * 5 = 720.So, ( k = 720 ).But wait, let me verify if ( 720^2 ) actually divides ( 10! ).First, ( 10! = 3628800 ).Calculating ( 720^2 ): 720 * 720 = 518400.Now, let's divide ( 10! ) by ( 720^2 ): 3628800 / 518400.Calculating that: 3628800 ÷ 518400.Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 36288 ÷ 5184.Divide numerator and denominator by 100 again: 362.88 ÷ 51.84.Wait, that's getting messy. Maybe a better approach is to factor both numbers.We already have the prime factorization of ( 10! ): ( 2^8 times 3^4 times 5^2 times 7 ).( 720^2 ) is ( (2^4 times 3^2 times 5)^2 = 2^8 times 3^4 times 5^2 ).So, when we divide ( 10! ) by ( 720^2 ), we get:( (2^8 times 3^4 times 5^2 times 7) / (2^8 times 3^4 times 5^2) = 7 ).Which is an integer, so yes, ( 720^2 ) divides ( 10! ).Is there a larger ( k ) possible? Let's see.Suppose we try to increase ( k ) by including another prime factor. The next prime after 5 is 7, but in ( 10! ), the exponent of 7 is only 1. Since ( k^2 ) would require an even exponent, we can't include 7 in ( k ) because that would require at least 2 exponents in ( 10! ), which we don't have.What about increasing the exponents of existing primes beyond what we've already used?For prime 2: We used 8 exponents in ( k^2 ), which is the maximum available in ( 10! ). So, we can't increase that.For prime 3: Similarly, we used 4 exponents, which is the maximum available.For prime 5: We used 2 exponents, which is the maximum. So, no room for increase there either.So, it seems that 720 is indeed the largest integer ( k ) such that ( k^2 ) divides ( 10! ).Wait, just to double-check, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem.I recall that the largest square factor of a number is the product of the largest square factors of its prime exponents. So, for each prime, take the largest even exponent less than or equal to the exponent in the original number, and then multiply them together.Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, that confirms my approach.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that ( k^2 ) divides ( 10! ) if and only if ( k ) divides the square root of ( 10! ). But since ( 10! ) isn't a perfect square, we take the integer part of its square root, but that might complicate things.Wait, actually, no. Because ( k ) doesn't have to be the square root of ( 10! ); rather, ( k^2 ) must divide ( 10! ). So, it's more about the exponents in the prime factors.I think my initial approach is solid. So, I feel confident that 720 is the correct answer.Just to recap:1. Find prime factorization of ( 10! ): ( 2^8 times 3^4 times 5^2 times 7^1 ).2. For each prime, take the largest even exponent less than or equal to the exponent in ( 10! ):   - 2: 8 (even)   - 3: 4 (even)   - 5: 2 (even)   - 7: 0 (since 1 is odd, we take 0)3. So, ( k^2 = 2^8 times 3^4 times 5^2 ).4. Therefore, ( k = 2^{4} times 3^{2} times 5^{1} = 16 times 9 times 5 = 720 ).Yep, that all adds up. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I think 720 is the right answer.**Final Answer**The largest integer ( k ) is boxed{720}."},{"question":"A robot colors natural numbers starting from 1 in ascending order according to the following rule: any natural number that can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers is colored red, and those that do not meet the above criteria are colored yellow. If the numbers colored red are counted in ascending order, then the 1992nd number is boxed{2001}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a robot colors natural numbers starting from 1. The rule is that if a number can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers, it's colored red; otherwise, it's yellow. The question tells me that the 1992nd red number is 2001, and I need to figure out why that is the case. Hmm, let me try to break this down.First, let me recall what composite numbers are. Composite numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that aren't prime, meaning they have factors other than 1 and themselves. So, the composite numbers start from 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and so on.The robot is coloring numbers red if they can be written as the sum of two composite numbers. So, for example, 8 can be written as 4 + 4, both of which are composite, so 8 would be red. Similarly, 9 can be written as 4 + 5, but 5 is prime, so that doesn't count. Wait, but 9 can also be written as 6 + 3, but 3 is prime too. Hmm, so is 9 red or yellow? Wait, 9 can be written as 4 + 5, but 5 is prime, so that doesn't work. 6 + 3, same problem. 8 + 1, but 1 isn't composite. So, actually, 9 cannot be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers. So, 9 would be yellow.Wait, hold on, let me check that again. 9: Let's see, 4 + 5 is 9, but 5 is prime. 6 + 3 is 9, 3 is prime. 8 + 1 is 9, 1 isn't composite. 9 can't be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers, so it's yellow.Similarly, let's take 10. 10 can be 4 + 6, both composite, so 10 is red. 11: Let's see, 4 + 7 (7 prime), 6 + 5 (5 prime), 8 + 3 (3 prime), 9 + 2 (2 prime). So, 11 can't be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers, so it's yellow.Wait, so starting from 1, let's see which numbers are red and which are yellow.1: Can't be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers because the smallest composite is 4, so 1 is yellow.2: Same reasoning, 2 is yellow.3: Yellow.4: 4 is composite, but we need two composite numbers. 4 can be 4 + 0, but 0 isn't natural. So, 4 is yellow.5: 5 is prime, so yellow.6: 6 is composite. Can it be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers? 4 + 2, but 2 is prime. 6 + 0, nope. So, 6 is yellow.7: 7 is prime, yellow.8: 4 + 4, both composite, so 8 is red.9: As we saw, yellow.10: 4 + 6, red.11: Yellow.12: Let's see, 4 + 8, both composite. So, 12 is red.13: Let's check. 4 + 9, 9 is composite, so 13 is red.14: 4 + 10, both composite, so red.15: 6 + 9, both composite, so red.16: 4 + 12, red.17: 4 + 13 (13 is prime), 6 + 11 (prime), 8 + 9 (both composite). So, 17 is red.18: 4 + 14, red.19: Let's check. 4 + 15, 15 is composite, so 19 is red.20: 4 + 16, red.Wait, so starting from 8, most numbers seem to be red except for a few. Let me see, so 8 is red, 9 is yellow, 10 is red, 11 is yellow, 12 is red, 13 is red, 14 is red, 15 is red, 16 is red, 17 is red, 18 is red, 19 is red, 20 is red.So, 9 and 11 are yellow in the early numbers. Let me check 21: 4 + 17 (17 prime), 6 + 15 (15 composite), so 21 is red.22: 4 + 18, red.23: 4 + 19 (19 prime), 6 + 17 (17 prime), 8 + 15 (15 composite), so 23 is red.24: 4 + 20, red.25: 4 + 21, red.26: 4 + 22, red.27: 9 + 18, red.28: 4 + 24, red.29: 4 + 25, red.30: 4 + 26, red.31: 4 + 27, red.32: 4 + 28, red.33: 4 + 29 (29 prime), 6 + 27, red.34: 4 + 30, red.35: 4 + 31 (31 prime), 6 + 29 (29 prime), 8 + 27, red.36: 4 + 32, red.37: 4 + 33, red.38: 4 + 34, red.39: 4 + 35, red.40: 4 + 36, red.41: 4 + 37 (37 prime), 6 + 35, red.42: 4 + 38, red.43: 4 + 39, red.44: 4 + 40, red.45: 4 + 41 (41 prime), 6 + 39, red.46: 4 + 42, red.47: 4 + 43 (43 prime), 6 + 41 (41 prime), 8 + 39, red.48: 4 + 44, red.49: 4 + 45, red.50: 4 + 46, red.Hmm, so starting from 8, the only yellow numbers are 9 and 11.

Wait, is that really the case? Let me check higher numbers.Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the general case. If a number can be written as the sum of two composite numbers, it's red. So, starting from 8, which is 4 + 4, red. 9 is 4 + 5, which doesn't work because 5 is prime. 10 is 4 + 6, red. 11 is 4 + 7, which is prime, so yellow. 12 is 4 + 8, red. 13 is 4 + 9, red. 14 is 4 + 10, red. 15 is 6 + 9, red. 16 is 4 + 12, red. 17 is 8 + 9, red. 18 is 4 + 14, red. 19 is 4 + 15, red. 20 is 4 + 16, red.So, starting from 8, except for 9 and 11, all numbers seem to be red. So, the yellow numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11. Wait, 1 is yellow, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11. So, that's 9 yellow numbers up to 11. Then, starting from 12, all numbers are red? Wait, no, 12 is red, 13 is red, 14 is red, etc. So, after 11, all numbers are red. Is that true?Wait, let me check 12: 4 + 8, red. 13: 4 + 9, red. 14: 4 + 10, red. 15: 6 + 9, red. 16: 4 + 12, red. 17: 8 + 9, red. 18: 4 + 14, red. 19: 4 + 15, red. 20: 4 + 16, red. 21: 6 + 15, red. 22: 4 + 18, red. 23: 8 + 15, red. 24: 4 + 20, red. 25: 4 + 21, red. 26: 4 + 22, red. 27: 9 + 18, red. 28: 4 + 24, red. 29: 4 + 25, red. 30: 4 + 26, red. 31: 4 + 27, red. 32: 4 + 28, red. 33: 6 + 27, red. 34: 4 + 30, red. 35: 8 + 27, red. 36: 4 + 32, red. 37: 4 + 33, red. 38: 4 + 34, red. 39: 4 + 35, red. 40: 4 + 36, red. 41: 6 + 35, red. 42: 4 + 38, red. 43: 4 + 39, red. 44: 4 + 40, red. 45: 6 + 39, red. 46: 4 + 42, red. 47: 8 + 39, red. 48: 4 + 44, red. 49: 4 + 45, red. 50: 4 + 46, red.So, yes, starting from 8, except for 9 and 11, all numbers are red. So, the yellow numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11. That's 9 numbers. So, from 12 onwards, all numbers are red. So, the red numbers start at 8, then 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, etc. So, the red numbers are 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, and so on.So, the red numbers are all numbers from 8 onwards, except for 9 and 11. So, the count of red numbers is total numbers minus the yellow numbers. Since yellow numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, that's 9 numbers. So, starting from 1, the red numbers are 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, etc. So, the red numbers are all numbers from 8 onwards, except 9 and 11.So, to find the 1992nd red number, we can think of it as starting from 8, and counting each number except 9 and 11. So, the first red number is 8, which is the 1st. Then 10 is the 2nd, 12 is the 3rd, 13 is the 4th, 14 is the 5th, 15 is the 6th, 16 is the 7th, 17 is the 8th, 18 is the 9th, 19 is the 10th, 20 is the 11th, and so on.But wait, actually, starting from 8, the red numbers are 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, etc. So, the red numbers are all numbers from 8 onwards, except 9 and 11. So, the sequence of red numbers is 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, etc.So, to find the 1992nd red number, we can think of it as starting from 8, and each number after that, except for 9 and 11, counts as a red number. So, the position of a number n in the red sequence is n - 8 + 1 (since 8 is the first red number) minus the number of yellow numbers between 8 and n.But wait, the yellow numbers are only 9 and 11. So, for n >= 12, the number of yellow numbers between 8 and n is 2 (9 and 11). So, for n >= 12, the position of n in the red sequence is n - 8 - 2 = n - 10.Wait, let me check that. Let's take n = 12. The position should be 3rd red number. According to the formula, 12 - 10 = 2, but 12 is the 3rd red number. Hmm, maybe my formula is off.Wait, let's think differently. The red numbers start at 8. So, the first red number is 8, which is position 1. Then 10 is position 2, 12 is position 3, 13 is position 4, and so on. So, for n >= 8, the position of n is n - 8 + 1 minus the number of yellow numbers between 8 and n.But the yellow numbers between 8 and n are 9 and 11, so for n >= 12, the number of yellow numbers is 2. So, the position of n is (n - 8 + 1) - 2 = n - 9.Wait, let's test this. For n = 8: position should be 1. 8 - 9 = -1, which is wrong. Hmm, maybe my approach is incorrect.Alternatively, let's think of the red numbers as starting from 8, and each number after that is red except 9 and 11. So, the red numbers are 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, etc. So, the sequence is:1: 82: 103: 124: 135: 146: 157: 168: 179: 1810: 1911: 2012: 2113: 2214: 2315: 2416: 2517: 2618: 2719: 2820: 2921: 30...So, the position k corresponds to the number n. Let's see if we can find a formula for n in terms of k.From k=1 to k=2, we have n=8,10.From k=3 onwards, n starts at 12 and increases by 1 each time, except skipping 9 and 11.Wait, but 12 is the 3rd red number, 13 is the 4th, 14 is the 5th, etc. So, for k >=3, n = 12 + (k - 3). So, n = k + 9.Wait, let's check:k=3: n=12, 3+9=12, correct.k=4: n=13, 4+9=13, correct.k=5: n=14, 5+9=14, correct.k=6: n=15, 6+9=15, correct.Yes, so for k >=3, n = k + 9.But wait, what about k=1 and k=2?k=1: n=8, which is 1 + 7.k=2: n=10, which is 2 + 8.Hmm, so maybe the formula is piecewise.Alternatively, we can think of the red numbers as starting from 8, and each subsequent number is red except 9 and 11. So, the red numbers are:8 (k=1),10 (k=2),12 (k=3),13 (k=4),14 (k=5),15 (k=6),16 (k=7),17 (k=8),18 (k=9),19 (k=10),20 (k=11),21 (k=12),22 (k=13),23 (k=14),24 (k=15),...So, for k >=3, n = 12 + (k - 3) = k + 9.Therefore, for k=1992, n=1992 + 9=2001.Wait, that seems to fit. So, the 1992nd red number is 2001.But let me verify this formula.For k=3, n=12, which is correct.For k=4, n=13, correct.For k=10, n=19, correct.For k=11, n=20, correct.So, yes, for k >=3, n = k + 9.Therefore, for k=1992, n=1992 + 9=2001.So, the 1992nd red number is 2001.But let me think again. Is this correct? Because starting from k=3, n=12, so the formula is n = k + 9. So, for k=1992, n=1992 + 9=2001.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the red numbers are all numbers from 8 onwards, except 9 and 11. So, the total number of red numbers up to some number N is N - 8 + 1 - 2 = N - 9. So, if we set N - 9 = 1992, then N=1992 + 9=2001.Yes, that makes sense.So, the 1992nd red number is 2001.**Final Answer**boxed{2001}"},{"question":"The sum of all integers whose absolute value is less than 2005 is boxed{0}.","answer":"To determine the sum of all integers whose absolute value is less than 2005, I first identify the range of integers involved.

The passengers exit in groups of two, three, and four people. In how many ways can this happen?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: there's an elevator with 9 passengers, and it can stop at ten different floors. The passengers exit in groups of two, three, and four people. I need to figure out in how many ways this can happen. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First off, the elevator has 9 passengers, and they're going to exit in groups of 2, 3, and 4. So, that adds up to 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 passengers, which makes sense. So, the passengers are divided into three groups: one group of 2, one group of 3, and one group of 4. Each of these groups will exit at different floors. The elevator can stop at ten different floors, so each group can choose any of these ten floors to exit on. Wait, but does each group have to exit on a different floor? The problem doesn't specify that, so I think it's possible for multiple groups to exit on the same floor. So, each group independently chooses a floor to exit on, and they can choose the same floor or different ones. But hold on, if all three groups exit on the same floor, that would mean all 9 passengers exit on that one floor. But the problem says they exit in groups of 2, 3, and 4. So, does that mean each group must exit on a separate floor? Hmm, the problem doesn't explicitly say that, but it does say \\"exit in groups of two, three, and four people.\\" So, maybe each group exits on a different floor? Or maybe they can exit on the same floor? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.Let me read the problem again: \\"An elevator containing 9 passengers can stop at ten different floors. The passengers exit in groups of two, three, and four people. In how many ways can this happen?\\" So, it just says they exit in groups of two, three, and four. It doesn't specify whether each group exits on a separate floor or not. So, I think it's possible that multiple groups can exit on the same floor. So, each group independently chooses a floor, and they can choose the same or different floors.But wait, if they choose the same floor, then that floor would have all three groups exiting there, meaning 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 passengers exit on that one floor. So, in that case, the elevator only stops at one floor. But the problem says it can stop at ten different floors, so maybe it's allowed to stop at any number of floors from 1 to 10. Hmm, okay, so the number of stops can vary depending on how the groups choose their floors.So, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of ways to assign each group to a floor, where each group can choose any of the ten floors, and the groups are distinguishable because they have different sizes. So, the group of 2 is different from the group of 3 and the group of 4.So, if that's the case, then for each group, there are 10 choices of floors. Since there are three groups, the total number of ways would be 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.But hold on, the passengers are being divided into groups of 2, 3, and 4. So, first, I need to figure out how many ways to divide the 9 passengers into these groups, and then for each such division, figure out how many ways they can exit on the floors.So, perhaps the total number of ways is the number of ways to partition the passengers into groups of 2, 3, and 4 multiplied by the number of ways each group can choose a floor.Okay, so first, let's calculate the number of ways to partition 9 passengers into groups of 2, 3, and 4. This is a multinomial coefficient problem.The formula for dividing n distinct objects into groups of sizes k1, k2, ..., km is n! / (k1! * k2! * ... * km!). So, in this case, n = 9, and the group sizes are 2, 3, and 4.So, the number of ways to partition the passengers is 9! / (2! * 3! * 4!). Let me compute that:9! = 3628802! = 23! = 64! = 24So, 362880 / (2 * 6 * 24) = 362880 / (288) = let's do the division.362880 divided by 288. Let's see:288 * 1000 = 288,000362,880 - 288,000 = 74,880288 * 200 = 57,60074,880 - 57,600 = 17,280288 * 60 = 17,280So, total is 1000 + 200 + 60 = 1260.So, 9! / (2! * 3! * 4!) = 1260 ways to partition the passengers into groups of 2, 3, and 4.Now, for each such partition, each group can choose a floor to exit on. Since there are ten different floors, each group has 10 choices. Since the groups are of different sizes, they are distinguishable, so the choices are independent.Therefore, for each partition, the number of ways the groups can choose floors is 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000.Therefore, the total number of ways is 1260 * 1000 = 1,260,000.But wait, is that correct? Let me think again.So, the passengers are being divided into groups, and each group independently chooses a floor. So, the total number of ways is the number of ways to divide the passengers into groups multiplied by the number of ways each group can choose a floor.Yes, that seems right. So, 1260 * 10^3 = 1,260,000.But wait, another thought: does the order of the groups matter? For example, if we have group A, group B, and group C, each choosing a floor, does the order in which we assign the floors matter? Or is it just the assignment of floors to group sizes?Wait, in the multinomial coefficient, we considered the groups as distinguishable because they have different sizes. So, group of 2, group of 3, and group of 4 are distinct. Therefore, assigning floor 1 to the group of 2 and floor 2 to the group of 3 is different from assigning floor 2 to the group of 2 and floor 1 to the group of 3.Therefore, the multiplication by 10^3 is correct because each group independently chooses a floor.So, yes, 1260 * 1000 = 1,260,000.But hold on, is there another way to think about this problem? Maybe considering permutations or something else.Alternatively, think of it as assigning each passenger to a floor, but with the constraint that exactly two passengers get assigned to one floor, three to another, and four to another. But since the groups are of different sizes, the assignment is unique.Wait, but in this case, the problem is about the groups exiting, not assigning individual passengers to floors. So, the groups are formed first, and then each group chooses a floor.So, perhaps the initial approach is correct.But let me check: if we think of it as assigning each passenger to a floor, with the constraint that exactly two passengers go to one floor, three to another, and four to another, then the number of ways would be:First, choose which floor gets 2 passengers, which gets 3, and which gets 4. Since there are ten floors, we need to choose three distinct floors for each group. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that the groups have to exit on different floors. So, they could all exit on the same floor, or two on one and one on another, etc.Wait, this is getting more complicated. So, maybe my initial approach was too simplistic.Wait, hold on. The problem says the passengers exit in groups of two, three, and four. So, does that mean that each group must exit on a separate floor? Or can multiple groups exit on the same floor?If each group must exit on a separate floor, then we have to choose three distinct floors, one for each group, and assign each group to a floor. Then, the number of ways would be:Number of ways to partition passengers into groups: 1260.Number of ways to assign each group to a distinct floor: P(10,3) = 10 * 9 * 8 = 720.Therefore, total number of ways: 1260 * 720 = let's compute that.1260 * 700 = 882,0001260 * 20 = 25,200So, total is 882,000 + 25,200 = 907,200.But wait, this is different from the previous result. So, which one is correct?The problem says the elevator can stop at ten different floors. It doesn't specify whether the stops have to be different or not. So, if the groups can exit on the same floor, then the number of ways would be 1260 * 10^3 = 1,260,000.But if the groups have to exit on different floors, then it's 1260 * P(10,3) = 907,200.So, which interpretation is correct?Looking back at the problem: \\"The passengers exit in groups of two, three, and four people.\\" It doesn't specify whether these groups exit on the same floor or different floors. So, in real-life terms, an elevator can stop at multiple floors, and each group can choose any floor, possibly the same as another group.But in the context of combinatorial problems, when it says \\"exit in groups,\\" it might imply that each group exits on a different floor. Because if they exited on the same floor, it would just be one group exiting, not three separate groups.Wait, but the problem says \\"exit in groups of two, three, and four people.\\" So, it's about the composition of the groups, not necessarily about the floors. So, perhaps the groups can exit on any floor, including the same one.But in reality, if all three groups exit on the same floor, then effectively, all passengers exit on that one floor, which is a single stop. But the problem says the elevator can stop at ten different floors, so it's allowed to stop at any number of floors, from 1 to 10.So, the problem is asking for the number of ways the passengers can exit in groups of 2, 3, and 4, regardless of how many floors the elevator stops at. So, each group independently chooses a floor, which could be the same or different.Therefore, the total number of ways is the number of ways to partition the passengers into groups multiplied by the number of ways each group can choose a floor, which is 10 choices per group.So, 1260 * 10^3 = 1,260,000.But wait, another thought: when we assign floors to the groups, if multiple groups choose the same floor, does that affect the count? For example, if two groups choose the same floor, does that mean that floor has two groups exiting, but in reality, it's just all passengers exiting on that floor. But in terms of counting, since the groups are distinguishable by their sizes, assigning two groups to the same floor is a valid scenario, even though in reality, it's just one stop.But in combinatorial terms, since the groups are distinct, assigning them to the same floor is a separate case from assigning them to different floors. So, in that sense, the total number of ways is indeed 1260 * 10^3.Alternatively, if we think of it as functions: each group is assigned a floor, so it's a function from the set of groups to the set of floors. Since there are three groups and ten floors, the number of functions is 10^3.Therefore, the total number of ways is 1260 * 1000 = 1,260,000.But wait, let me check if the groups are distinguishable. If the groups are indistinct except for their sizes, then perhaps we need to consider whether assigning group A to floor 1 and group B to floor 2 is different from assigning group B to floor 1 and group A to floor 2.But since the groups are of different sizes, they are distinguishable. So, yes, assigning the group of 2 to floor 1 and the group of 3 to floor 2 is different from assigning the group of 3 to floor 1 and the group of 2 to floor 2.Therefore, the multiplication by 10^3 is correct.So, putting it all together:Number of ways to partition passengers into groups of 2, 3, and 4: 1260.Number of ways each group can choose a floor: 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000.Total number of ways: 1260 * 1000 = 1,260,000.Therefore, the answer should be 1,260,000.But just to make sure, let me think of another approach.Suppose we consider each passenger individually. Each passenger can choose any of the ten floors to exit on. So, the total number of ways without any group constraints is 10^9. But we have the constraint that exactly two passengers exit on one floor, three on another, and four on another. So, we need to count the number of ways to assign the passengers to floors such that one floor has two passengers, another has three, and another has four, with the rest of the floors having zero passengers.Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that only those three floors are used. It just says the elevator can stop at ten different floors. So, the elevator could stop at three floors, or two, or one, depending on how the groups choose.But in this case, since we have three groups, each choosing a floor, the elevator will stop at as many floors as the number of distinct floors chosen by the groups. So, it could be one, two, or three floors.But in terms of counting, if we think of it as assigning each group to a floor, regardless of whether other groups are assigned to the same floor, then the total number of assignments is 10^3, as before.Alternatively, if we think of it as assigning passengers to floors with the group size constraints, then the number of ways would be:First, choose which floor gets 2 passengers, which gets 3, and which gets 4. If the floors must be distinct, then it's C(10,3) * 3! * (number of ways to assign passengers). But if floors can be the same, then it's more complicated.Wait, maybe this is another way to compute it:Number of ways = (number of ways to assign passengers to floors with group sizes 2,3,4) * (number of ways to assign floors to these groups).But actually, I think this is similar to the first approach.Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as:First, choose the floors for each group. Since each group can choose any floor, including the same as another group, the number of ways to assign floors is 10^3.Then, for each such assignment, the number of ways to assign passengers to these groups is the multinomial coefficient 9! / (2! 3! 4!) = 1260.Therefore, total number of ways is 1260 * 10^3 = 1,260,000.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, if we think of it as:First, choose the floors for each group. If the groups can share floors, then it's 10 choices for each group, so 10^3.Then, for each such choice, assign the passengers to the groups. Since the groups are of different sizes, the number of ways is 9! / (2! 3! 4!) = 1260.Therefore, total is 1260 * 1000 = 1,260,000.Yes, that seems correct.Wait, but another perspective: suppose we consider the problem as a function from the set of passengers to the set of floors, with the constraint that the preimage of each floor is either size 0, 2, 3, or 4, and exactly one floor has preimage size 2, exactly one floor has preimage size 3, exactly one floor has preimage size 4, and the rest have size 0.But in this case, the number of such functions would be:First, choose which floor gets 2 passengers: 10 choices.Choose which floor gets 3 passengers: 10 choices.Choose which floor gets 4 passengers: 10 choices.But wait, if we allow the same floor to be chosen multiple times, then it's 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 ways to assign the group sizes to floors.Then, for each such assignment, the number of ways to assign passengers is 9! / (2! 3! 4!) = 1260.Therefore, total number of functions is 1000 * 1260 = 1,260,000.Alternatively, if we require that the three floors are distinct, then it's P(10,3) = 720 ways to assign the group sizes to distinct floors, and then 1260 ways to assign passengers, giving 720 * 1260 = 907,200.But the problem doesn't specify that the floors have to be distinct, so I think the first interpretation is correct, allowing the same floor to be used by multiple groups.Therefore, the total number of ways is 1,260,000.Wait, but let me think again. If all three groups choose the same floor, then effectively, all passengers exit on that one floor, which is a single stop. So, in that case, the number of stops is one, but the problem says the elevator can stop at ten different floors, but doesn't specify that it has to stop at multiple floors.So, in that case, the count includes scenarios where all groups exit on the same floor, which is allowed.Therefore, the total number of ways is indeed 1,260,000.But just to make sure, let me think of a smaller case. Suppose there are 3 passengers, exiting in groups of 1, 1, and 1, and there are 2 floors. How many ways would that be?Using the same logic: number of ways to partition passengers into groups of 1,1,1: 3! / (1!1!1!) = 6.Number of ways each group can choose a floor: 2^3 = 8.Total number of ways: 6 * 8 = 48.But let's count manually. Each passenger can choose either floor 1 or floor 2. So, total number of ways is 2^3 = 8. But since the passengers are distinguishable, and the groups are indistinct except for their sizes (which are all 1), so actually, the number of ways is 8, not 48.Wait, that contradicts my earlier logic. So, in this smaller case, my initial approach overcounts.Wait, why is that? Because in the smaller case, the groups are indistinct in size, so swapping groups doesn't create a new arrangement. But in the original problem, the groups are of different sizes, so they are distinguishable.So, in the smaller case, if the groups were of different sizes, say, groups of 1, 1, and 1, but with different labels, then it would be different. But since they are all size 1, they are indistinct.Therefore, in the original problem, since the groups are of different sizes, they are distinguishable, so assigning different floors to them matters.But in the smaller case, if the groups are indistinct, then assigning them to floors doesn't multiply the count by the number of permutations.Therefore, in the original problem, since the groups are distinguishable by size, the multiplication by 10^3 is correct.But in the smaller case with groups of 1,1,1, since they are indistinct, the number of ways is just the number of ways to assign passengers to floors, which is 2^3 = 8, not multiplied by anything else.Therefore, in the original problem, since the groups are distinguishable, the total number of ways is indeed 1260 * 1000 = 1,260,000.So, I think that's the correct answer.**Final Answer**The number of ways this can happen is boxed{1260000}."},{"question":"Find the remainder when 6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26 is divided by 2x - 6.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the polynomial (6x^4 - 14x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 26) is divided by (2x - 6). Hmm, I remember that when you divide a polynomial by a linear divisor like this, the remainder theorem can be useful. Let me recall what that is.The Remainder Theorem states that if a polynomial (f(x)) is divided by (x - c), the remainder is (f(c)). But in this case, the divisor is (2x - 6), which isn't exactly in the form (x - c). Maybe I can factor out a 2 from the divisor to make it look like (x - c). Let me try that.So, (2x - 6 = 2(x - 3)). That means the divisor is 2 times ((x - 3)). Hmm, so does that affect the remainder? I think so. Because if I factor out the 2, I can still apply the Remainder Theorem but I might have to adjust for the factor of 2.Wait, actually, the Remainder Theorem directly applies when the divisor is linear, regardless of the coefficient. So maybe I can still use it here. Let me think. If I set (2x - 6 = 0), then solving for x gives (x = 3). So, according to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder should be (f(3)).Let me test that. If I plug (x = 3) into the polynomial (6x^4 - 14x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 26), I should get the remainder. Let me compute that step by step.First, compute each term:1. (6x^4): (6*(3)^4). (3^4 = 81), so (6*81 = 486).2. (-14x^3): (-14*(3)^3). (3^3 = 27), so (-14*27 = -378).3. (-4x^2): (-4*(3)^2). (3^2 = 9), so (-4*9 = -36).4. (2x): (2*3 = 6).5. (-26): That's just (-26).Now, add all these together:486 - 378 - 36 + 6 - 26.Let me compute step by step:486 - 378 = 108.108 - 36 = 72.72 + 6 = 78.78 - 26 = 52.So, the remainder is 52? Wait, but hold on. Earlier, I factored out a 2 from the divisor, making it (2(x - 3)). Does that affect the remainder? Because in the Remainder Theorem, the divisor is (x - c), but here it's (2(x - c)). So, does the remainder get scaled by the same factor?Hmm, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check.When dividing by (2x - 6), which is (2(x - 3)), the Remainder Theorem still applies, but the remainder is a constant, right? Because when you divide by a linear term, the remainder is of degree less than 1, so it's a constant.But wait, if I use the Remainder Theorem as is, plugging in (x = 3), I get 52. But does that mean the remainder is 52, or do I have to adjust it because the divisor was scaled by 2?I think I need to reconsider. Maybe I should perform polynomial long division to be sure.Alright, let's set up the long division. Dividing (6x^4 -14x^3 -4x^2 +2x -26) by (2x - 6).First, I divide the leading term of the dividend, which is (6x^4), by the leading term of the divisor, which is (2x). So, (6x^4 / 2x = 3x^3). That's the first term of the quotient.Now, multiply the entire divisor (2x - 6) by (3x^3), which gives (6x^4 - 18x^3).Subtract this from the original polynomial:[(6x^4 -14x^3 -4x^2 +2x -26) - (6x^4 - 18x^3) = (0x^4) + (4x^3) -4x^2 +2x -26]So, the new polynomial is (4x^3 -4x^2 +2x -26).Next, divide the leading term (4x^3) by (2x), which gives (2x^2). That's the next term in the quotient.Multiply the divisor by (2x^2): (4x^3 -12x^2).Subtract this from the current polynomial:[(4x^3 -4x^2 +2x -26) - (4x^3 -12x^2) = (0x^3) +8x^2 +2x -26]So now, the polynomial is (8x^2 +2x -26).Divide the leading term (8x^2) by (2x), which gives (4x). That's the next term in the quotient.Multiply the divisor by (4x): (8x^2 -24x).Subtract this from the current polynomial:[(8x^2 +2x -26) - (8x^2 -24x) = (0x^2) +26x -26]Now, the polynomial is (26x -26).Divide the leading term (26x) by (2x), which gives 13. That's the next term in the quotient.Multiply the divisor by 13: (26x -78).Subtract this from the current polynomial:[(26x -26) - (26x -78) = (0x) +52]So, the remainder is 52. That matches what I got earlier with the Remainder Theorem.Wait, so even though I factored out a 2 earlier, the remainder is still 52? That seems correct because when I did the long division, I didn't factor out the 2, I just divided by (2x -6) directly, and the remainder came out as 52.So, maybe my initial confusion was unnecessary. The Remainder Theorem still applies because the divisor is linear, regardless of the coefficient. So, plugging in (x = 3) gives the remainder directly, which is 52.Alternatively, if I had used the divisor (x - 3), the remainder would have been 52, but since the divisor is (2x -6), which is 2 times (x -3), does that affect the remainder? Hmm, no, because the remainder is just a constant, and the scaling factor of the divisor doesn't affect the remainder's value. It only affects the quotient.So, in conclusion, the remainder is 52.Wait, just to make sure, let me verify with another method. Maybe synthetic division? Although synthetic division is usually for divisors of the form (x - c), but I can adjust it for (2x -6).Alternatively, I can factor out the 2 from the divisor and see if that changes anything.Let me write the division as:[frac{6x^4 -14x^3 -4x^2 +2x -26}{2x -6} = Q(x) + frac{R}{2x -6}]But actually, in polynomial division, the remainder R must satisfy degree(R) < degree(divisor). Since the divisor is degree 1, R is a constant. So, R is just a number.But if I factor out the 2, the division becomes:[frac{6x^4 -14x^3 -4x^2 +2x -26}{2(x -3)} = frac{Q(x)}{2} + frac{R}{2(x -3)}]Wait, that might complicate things. Maybe it's better not to factor out the 2 and just do the division as is.But since I've already done the long division and got 52, and the Remainder Theorem also gave me 52, I think that's solid.Just to recap, using Remainder Theorem:Divisor is (2x -6), set equal to zero: (2x -6 = 0 Rightarrow x = 3).Compute (f(3)):(6*(3)^4 -14*(3)^3 -4*(3)^2 +2*(3) -26).Compute each term:(6*81 = 486)(-14*27 = -378)(-4*9 = -36)(2*3 = 6)(-26)Add them up:486 - 378 = 108108 - 36 = 7272 + 6 = 7878 - 26 = 52So, yes, 52 is the remainder.Therefore, I'm confident that the remainder is 52.**Final Answer**The remainder is boxed{52}."},{"question":"The slant height of a cone is 6 cm, and the central angle of its lateral surface when unfolded is 120°. Find the radius r of the base of the cone in cm.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a cone. The slant height is given as 6 cm, and when you unfold the lateral surface, the central angle is 120 degrees. I need to find the radius r of the base of the cone. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when you unfold a cone's lateral surface, you get a sector of a circle. The radius of this sector is equal to the slant height of the cone. So in this case, the radius of the sector is 6 cm. That makes sense because the slant height is the distance from the base to the tip of the cone along the surface.Now, the central angle of this sector is 120 degrees. I think the length of the arc of this sector is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone. Let me verify that. When you unfold the cone, the arc length becomes the circumference of the base. So yes, that should be the case.So, the arc length (let's call it L) of the sector can be calculated using the formula for the length of an arc: L = (θ/360) * 2πR, where θ is the central angle in degrees and R is the radius of the sector. Here, θ is 120 degrees, and R is 6 cm. Let me compute that.L = (120/360) * 2π * 6Simplify 120/360, which is 1/3. So,L = (1/3) * 2π * 6Multiply 1/3 and 6: 6/3 = 2, soL = 2 * 2π = 4π cmWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate.Wait, 1/3 * 2π * 6. So 2π * 6 is 12π, then 12π * 1/3 is 4π. Yeah, that's correct. So the arc length is 4π cm.But this arc length is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone. The circumference of a circle is 2πr, where r is the radius of the base. So,2πr = 4πDivide both sides by π:2r = 4Then, divide both sides by 2:r = 2 cmWait, so the radius is 2 cm? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.So, to recap: The lateral surface when unfolded is a sector with radius 6 cm and central angle 120 degrees. The arc length of this sector is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone.Calculating the arc length: (120/360)*2π*6 = (1/3)*12π = 4π.Circumference of the base: 2πr = 4π => r = 2 cm.Yes, that seems consistent. So, the radius of the base is 2 cm.Alternatively, I can think about the relationship between the sector and the cone. The slant height is the radius of the sector, which is 6 cm. The arc length is the circumference of the base, which is 2πr. The central angle is 120 degrees, which is a third of a full circle. So, the arc length is a third of the circumference of a full circle with radius 6 cm.Circumference of full circle: 2π*6 = 12π. A third of that is 4π, which is equal to 2πr. So, r is 2 cm.Yep, that checks out. I think that's the correct answer.**Final Answer**The radius of the base of the cone is boxed{2} cm."},{"question":"Among all the five-digit numbers formed without repeating digits using 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, if arranged in ascending order, what position would the number 12340 occupy?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the position of the number 12340 when all possible five-digit numbers formed without repeating digits using 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are arranged in ascending order. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand the constraints. We're using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and we can't repeat any digits. So each digit in the five-digit number must be unique. Also, since it's a five-digit number, the first digit can't be 0 because that would make it a four-digit number. Got it.So, the digits we can use are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and each digit must be used exactly once in each number. The task is to arrange all such numbers in ascending order and find the position of 12340.Let me start by figuring out how many such numbers there are in total. Since it's a five-digit number, the first digit has to be one of 1, 2, 3, or 4. That's 4 choices. Then, the remaining four digits can be any of the remaining four digits, including 0. So, for the second digit, we have 4 choices, then 3, then 2, then 1. So the total number of five-digit numbers is 4 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. Wait, hold on, that doesn't sound right.Wait, actually, the total number of permutations of 5 distinct digits is 5! = 120. But since the first digit can't be 0, we have to subtract the permutations where 0 is the first digit. If 0 is fixed as the first digit, then the remaining four digits can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. So the total number of valid five-digit numbers is 5! - 4! = 120 - 24 = 96. Okay, so there are 96 numbers in total.Now, I need to find the position of 12340 when these numbers are arranged in ascending order. Let's think about how numbers are ordered. The smallest number would be 10234, right? Because 1 is the smallest possible first digit, followed by 0, then 2, 3, 4. Wait, actually, no. Wait, 10234 is the smallest, but 10234 is smaller than 10243, which is smaller than 10324, and so on.But maybe it's better to break it down digit by digit. Let's consider the number 12340. Let me write it down: 1 2 3 4 0. Hmm, but wait, that's not in order. Wait, 12340 is actually 1, 2, 3, 4, 0. But in ascending order, 0 is the smallest digit, but it can't be the first digit. So, how does this number fit into the overall order?Wait, maybe I should think about how many numbers come before 12340. If I can count how many numbers are smaller than 12340, then the position of 12340 would be that count plus one.So, let's try to count how many numbers are smaller than 12340.First, let's note that the first digit of 12340 is 1. So, any number that starts with a digit less than 1 would come before it. But since the first digit can't be 0, the only possible first digit less than 1 is none. So, all numbers starting with 1 will come after numbers starting with 0, but since numbers can't start with 0, the first digit is at least 1.Wait, actually, numbers starting with 1 will be the first set of numbers, followed by numbers starting with 2, then 3, then 4. So, 12340 is in the group of numbers starting with 1.So, to find how many numbers come before 12340, I need to consider numbers starting with 1, and then look at the subsequent digits.So, let's break it down:1. Numbers starting with 1.Within numbers starting with 1, the remaining four digits are 0, 2, 3, 4. So, the second digit can be 0, 2, 3, or 4.Our number is 1 2 3 4 0, so the second digit is 2. So, numbers starting with 1 and then a digit less than 2 will come before our number.What digits are less than 2 in the remaining digits? Only 0. So, how many numbers start with 1 followed by 0?If the first two digits are 1 and 0, then the remaining three digits are 2, 3, 4. So, the number of such numbers is 3! = 6.So, there are 6 numbers starting with 10, which are all smaller than 12340.Now, moving on to numbers starting with 12. So, the first two digits are 1 and 2. Our number is 12340, so the third digit is 3. So, we need to consider numbers starting with 12 and then a digit less than 3.The remaining digits after 1 and 2 are 0, 3, 4. So, digits less than 3 are 0. So, how many numbers start with 120?If the first three digits are 1, 2, 0, then the remaining two digits are 3 and 4. So, the number of such numbers is 2! = 2.So, there are 2 numbers starting with 120, which are smaller than 12340.Next, moving on to numbers starting with 123. Our number is 12340, so the fourth digit is 4. So, we need to consider numbers starting with 123 and then a digit less than 4.The remaining digits after 1, 2, 3 are 0 and 4. So, digits less than 4 are 0. So, how many numbers start with 1230?If the first four digits are 1, 2, 3, 0, then the last digit is 4. So, only one number: 12304.Wait, but our number is 12340. So, 12304 is smaller than 12340, right? Because the fourth digit is 0 vs. 4. So, 12304 comes before 12340.So, that's one more number.Now, moving on to the fifth digit. Our number is 12340. So, the fifth digit is 0. But since we've already fixed the first four digits as 1, 2, 3, 4, the fifth digit can only be 0. So, there are no numbers starting with 1234 that are smaller than 12340 because 0 is the only remaining digit.Wait, but let me think again. If the first four digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, then the fifth digit must be 0. So, only one number: 12340. So, no numbers come after that in this subset.So, putting it all together, the numbers that come before 12340 are:1. Numbers starting with 10: 6 numbers2. Numbers starting with 120: 2 numbers3. Numbers starting with 1230: 1 numberSo, total numbers before 12340 are 6 + 2 + 1 = 9.Therefore, the position of 12340 is 9 + 1 = 10th position.Wait, but hold on. Let me verify this because sometimes when counting permutations, it's easy to make a mistake.Let me think about the first digit: 1. So, all numbers starting with 1 come before numbers starting with 2, 3, or 4. So, numbers starting with 1 are 4! = 24 numbers. Wait, no, because the first digit is fixed as 1, and the remaining four digits can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. So, there are 24 numbers starting with 1.But in our case, we are only counting numbers starting with 1 that are less than 12340.So, within the numbers starting with 1, the second digit can be 0, 2, 3, or 4.Our number has the second digit as 2. So, numbers starting with 10 will all come before numbers starting with 12, 13, 14.Numbers starting with 10: as we said, 6 numbers.Then, numbers starting with 12: the third digit in our number is 3. So, within numbers starting with 12, the third digit can be 0, 3, or 4.Wait, no. Wait, after fixing the first two digits as 1 and 2, the remaining digits are 0, 3, 4. So, the third digit can be 0, 3, or 4.Our number has the third digit as 3. So, numbers starting with 120 will come before numbers starting with 123.Numbers starting with 120: as we said, 2 numbers.Then, numbers starting with 123: the fourth digit in our number is 4. So, within numbers starting with 123, the fourth digit can be 0 or 4.Our number has the fourth digit as 4, so numbers starting with 1230 will come before numbers starting with 1234.Numbers starting with 1230: 1 number.Then, numbers starting with 1234: only one number, which is 12340.So, adding up the numbers before 12340:- Numbers starting with 10: 6- Numbers starting with 120: 2- Numbers starting with 1230: 1Total: 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 numbers.Therefore, 12340 is the 10th number in the list.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I missed some numbers?For example, when I fixed the first two digits as 1 and 2, I considered numbers starting with 120, but are there any numbers starting with 12 that have a third digit less than 3 but greater than 0? Wait, no, because after 1 and 2, the remaining digits are 0, 3, 4. So, the third digit can only be 0, 3, or 4. So, digits less than 3 are only 0. So, numbers starting with 120 are the only ones before 123.Similarly, when we fixed the first three digits as 1, 2, 3, the remaining digits are 0 and 4. So, the fourth digit can be 0 or 4. So, numbers starting with 1230 come before 1234.So, I think my count is correct.But just to be thorough, let me try to list out the numbers starting with 1 and see where 12340 falls.Numbers starting with 1:First, numbers starting with 10:10234, 10243, 10324, 10342, 10423, 10432. That's 6 numbers.Then, numbers starting with 12:12034, 12043, 12304, 12340, 12403, 12430.Wait, hold on. So, after 12034 and 12043, the next numbers would be 12304, then 12340, then 12403, 12430.Wait, so 12304 comes before 12340, which is correct. So, in this case, 12304 is the 7th number, and 12340 is the 8th number? Wait, no, hold on.Wait, let's list them properly.Numbers starting with 10:1. 102342. 102433. 103244. 103425. 104236. 10432Then, numbers starting with 12:7. 120348. 120439. 1230410. 1234011. 1240312. 12430Wait, so according to this list, 12340 is the 10th number. So, that matches our earlier count.But wait, hold on. When I listed the numbers starting with 12, I have 12034, 12043, 12304, 12340, 12403, 12430. That's 6 numbers. So, numbers starting with 12 are 6 numbers, which is 3! = 6, which makes sense because after fixing 1 and 2, the remaining three digits can be arranged in 3! ways.So, numbers starting with 10: 6 numbers (positions 1-6)Numbers starting with 12: 6 numbers (positions 7-12)Within numbers starting with 12, the order is determined by the remaining digits.So, the first two numbers starting with 12 are 12034 and 12043, which are the smallest because 0 is the next digit.Then, the next numbers are 12304, 12340, 12403, 12430.So, 12304 is the 7th number, 12340 is the 8th number? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in my list above, 12034 is 7th, 12043 is 8th, 12304 is 9th, 12340 is 10th, 12403 is 11th, 12430 is 12th.Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought that numbers starting with 12 would be 6 numbers, but in reality, the first two numbers starting with 12 are 12034 and 12043, which are 7th and 8th. Then, 12304 is 9th, 12340 is 10th, etc.So, according to this, 12340 is the 10th number.But wait, in my initial count, I had 6 numbers starting with 10, 2 numbers starting with 120, and 1 number starting with 1230, totaling 9 numbers before 12340, making it the 10th number. So, that matches.But when I list them out, 12340 is the 10th number. So, that seems consistent.But hold on, let me think again. When I fixed the first two digits as 1 and 2, the third digit can be 0, 3, or 4. So, numbers starting with 120 come before numbers starting with 123.Numbers starting with 120: 12034, 12043. So, that's two numbers.Then, numbers starting with 123: 12304, 12340, 12403, 12430. Wait, but 12403 and 12430 start with 124, which is higher than 123. So, actually, after 123, the next digit can be 0 or 4. So, 12304 and 12340 come before 12403 and 12430.Wait, so numbers starting with 123: 12304, 12340.Then, numbers starting with 124: 12403, 12430.So, in total, numbers starting with 12 are:12034, 12043, 12304, 12340, 12403, 12430.So, 6 numbers, as expected.So, in the overall list, numbers starting with 10: 6 numbers (positions 1-6)Numbers starting with 12: 6 numbers (positions 7-12)Within numbers starting with 12, the order is:7: 120348: 120439: 1230410: 1234011: 1240312: 12430So, 12340 is in position 10.Therefore, the position is 10.Wait, but earlier I thought that numbers starting with 1230 are only 12304, which is correct, and then 12340 is next.So, that seems consistent.But just to make sure, let me think about another approach.Another way to calculate the position is to consider each digit position and calculate how many numbers come before based on each digit.So, starting from the first digit:First digit: 1Numbers starting with digits less than 1: none, since the first digit can't be 0.So, numbers starting with 1: 4! = 24 numbers.But we need to find how many numbers starting with 1 are less than 12340.So, moving to the second digit:Second digit: 2Digits available after first digit 1: 0, 2, 3, 4.Digits less than 2: only 0.So, numbers starting with 10: 3! = 6 numbers.So, 6 numbers come before any number starting with 12.Now, moving to the third digit:Third digit: 3Digits available after first two digits 1 and 2: 0, 3, 4.Digits less than 3: only 0.So, numbers starting with 120: 2! = 2 numbers.So, 2 more numbers come before numbers starting with 123.Now, moving to the fourth digit:Fourth digit: 4Digits available after first three digits 1, 2, 3: 0, 4.Digits less than 4: only 0.So, numbers starting with 1230: 1! = 1 number.So, 1 more number comes before 12340.Finally, the fifth digit: 0No digits left, so no numbers come after 12340 in this subset.So, total numbers before 12340: 6 + 2 + 1 = 9.Therefore, 12340 is the 10th number.So, both methods give me the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the position is 10.But just to double-check, let me try to list all numbers starting with 1 and see where 12340 falls.Numbers starting with 1:1. 102342. 102433. 103244. 103425. 104236. 104327. 120348. 120439. 1230410. 1234011. 1240312. 1243013. 1302414. 1304215. 1320416. 1324017. 1340218. 1342019. 1402320. 1403221. 1420322. 1423023. 1430224. 14320Wait, hold on. So, according to this list, numbers starting with 1 are 24 numbers, as expected.Looking at the list, 12340 is at position 10. So, that's consistent with our earlier conclusion.Therefore, I can be confident that the position of 12340 is 10.**Final Answer**The number 12340 occupies the boxed{10} position."},{"question":"Two attending physicians and four interns are to be divided into two groups, which will be sent to locations A and B to participate in medical mutual aid activities. Each group consists of one attending physician and two interns. If intern A cannot be assigned to location A, then the total number of different allocation schemes is _________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are two attending physicians and four interns. They need to be divided into two groups, each consisting of one attending physician and two interns. These groups will go to locations A and B for medical mutual aid activities. The catch is that intern A cannot be assigned to location A. I need to figure out the total number of different allocation schemes possible under this condition.Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's consider the two attending physicians. Let's call them Dr. X and Dr. Y for simplicity. Each group must have one attending physician, so one will go to location A and the other to location B. So, the first thing is to decide which attending physician goes to which location.There are 2 attending physicians, so the number of ways to assign them to locations A and B is 2! = 2 ways. Either Dr. X goes to A and Dr. Y goes to B, or Dr. Y goes to A and Dr. X goes to B.Now, moving on to the interns. There are four interns in total, let's name them A, B, C, and D. Each location needs two interns. The key constraint here is that intern A cannot be assigned to location A. So, we need to figure out how many ways we can assign the interns to locations A and B without violating this constraint.Let me think about how to approach this. Since the assignment of attending physicians and interns are somewhat independent, except for the constraint on intern A, maybe I can calculate the number of ways to assign the interns given the attending physician assignments and then multiply by the number of ways to assign the attending physicians.Wait, but actually, the assignment of the attending physicians affects where the interns go because each group is assigned to a specific location. So, perhaps I should first assign the attending physicians and then assign the interns accordingly, considering the constraint.Alternatively, maybe it's better to first assign the interns considering the constraint and then assign the attending physicians. Hmm, not sure which is better. Let me try both approaches.First approach: Assign attending physicians first, then assign interns.There are 2 ways to assign the attending physicians to locations A and B.Once the attending physicians are assigned, we need to assign the interns. Since each location needs two interns, and there are four interns, we need to choose 2 interns for location A and the remaining 2 will go to location B.However, intern A cannot be assigned to location A. So, when assigning interns to location A, we cannot include intern A.So, how many ways can we choose 2 interns for location A without including intern A?There are 3 other interns: B, C, D. So, the number of ways to choose 2 interns from these 3 is C(3,2) = 3.Once we have assigned 2 interns to location A, the remaining 2 interns automatically go to location B. So, for each assignment of attending physicians, there are 3 ways to assign the interns.Therefore, the total number of allocation schemes would be the number of ways to assign attending physicians multiplied by the number of ways to assign interns. That is, 2 * 3 = 6.Wait, that seems low. Let me think again.Wait, no, because the assignment of interns is dependent on the attending physician assignments, but maybe I'm missing something.Alternatively, perhaps the number of ways to assign interns is more than 3 because the attending physician assignments might affect the total count.Wait, no, actually, regardless of which attending physician is assigned to location A or B, the constraint is only on intern A not being assigned to location A. So, regardless of who is the attending physician at A, the interns assigned to A cannot include A.So, perhaps the number of ways to assign interns is indeed 3, as calculated, regardless of the attending physician assignments.But wait, let me think about the total number of possible allocations without any constraints. Then, subtract the ones that violate the constraint.Total number of ways without any constraints:First, assign attending physicians: 2 ways.Then, assign interns: The number of ways to divide 4 interns into two groups of 2 is C(4,2) = 6. But since the groups are assigned to specific locations A and B, each division corresponds to two different allocations (one for A and one for B). Wait, no, actually, once you choose 2 interns for A, the other 2 go to B, so it's just C(4,2) = 6.Therefore, total number of allocations without constraints is 2 * 6 = 12.Now, the number of allocations where intern A is assigned to location A. Let's compute that and subtract from the total.Number of allocations where intern A is assigned to A:First, assign attending physicians: 2 ways.Then, assign interns with A in A. So, we need to choose 1 more intern to join A, since A is already assigned to A. The remaining interns are B, C, D. So, number of ways is C(3,1) = 3.Therefore, the number of allocations where A is in A is 2 * 3 = 6.Therefore, the number of valid allocations is total allocations without constraints minus allocations with A in A: 12 - 6 = 6.Wait, so that's the same answer as before, 6. But is that correct?Wait, another way to think about it: Let's fix the attending physicians first.Case 1: Dr. X goes to A, Dr. Y goes to B.We need to assign 2 interns to A (excluding A) and 2 to B.Number of ways: C(3,2) = 3.Case 2: Dr. Y goes to A, Dr. X goes to B.Similarly, number of ways: C(3,2) = 3.Total: 3 + 3 = 6.So, same result.But wait, is that correct? Because in each case, we have 3 ways, so total 6.Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating.Wait, another approach: Since the constraint is only on intern A, perhaps we can first assign intern A to location B, and then assign the remaining interns.So, if intern A is assigned to B, then we have 3 interns left: B, C, D.We need to assign 2 interns to A and 2 to B, but since A is already assigned to B, we need to assign 2 more to B and 2 to A.Wait, no, because each location needs 2 interns, and A is already assigned to B, so we need to assign 1 more intern to B and 2 interns to A.Wait, that might not be the right way.Wait, perhaps it's better to think that since intern A must go to B, we can assign A to B first, and then assign the remaining 3 interns (B, C, D) into the two locations, with each location needing 2 interns.But wait, location A needs 2 interns, and location B already has A, so it needs 1 more intern.So, the number of ways is to choose 2 interns out of B, C, D for location A, and the remaining 1 will go to location B.So, number of ways is C(3,2) = 3.But we also have to assign the attending physicians. There are 2 choices: Dr. X to A and Dr. Y to B, or Dr. Y to A and Dr. X to B.Therefore, total number of allocations is 2 * 3 = 6.Same result again.So, seems like 6 is the answer.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, in the first approach, I considered assigning attending physicians first, then assigning interns. In the second approach, I considered assigning intern A first, then assigning the rest. Both gave me 6.But let me think about the total number of possible allocations without constraints, which is 12, as calculated earlier. Then, the number of invalid allocations is 6, so valid is 6.But wait, is that correct? Because if we have 12 total allocations, and 6 of them have A in A, then 6 are valid. That seems correct.But let me think about it another way. Maybe using permutations.Wait, no, because the groups are being assigned to specific locations, so it's more of a combination problem.Alternatively, think of it as assigning each intern to a location, but with constraints.But since each location must have exactly two interns, and each attending physician must go to a location, it's more structured.Wait, another way: The total number of ways to assign the interns is C(4,2) = 6, as each group is assigned to a specific location.But since the attending physicians can be assigned in 2 ways, total is 12.Number of invalid assignments is when A is in A, which is C(3,1) = 3 for each attending physician assignment, so 6 in total.Therefore, 12 - 6 = 6.Yes, that seems consistent.Wait, but let me think about the actual assignments.Suppose we have attending physicians Dr. X and Dr. Y.Case 1: Dr. X goes to A, Dr. Y goes to B.We need to assign 2 interns to A (excluding A) and 2 to B.Available interns: B, C, D, and A.But A cannot go to A, so A must go to B.Therefore, for location A, we need to choose 2 from B, C, D.Number of ways: C(3,2) = 3.So, 3 ways.Similarly, Case 2: Dr. Y goes to A, Dr. X goes to B.Same situation: A cannot go to A, so A must go to B.Therefore, for location A, choose 2 from B, C, D: C(3,2) = 3.Total: 3 + 3 = 6.Yes, that's consistent.Therefore, the total number of different allocation schemes is 6.But wait, let me think again. Is there a way that the attending physician assignments could affect the intern assignments beyond just the location? For example, does the attending physician matter in terms of the intern assignments? Or is it just about the location?I think it's just about the location. The attending physician is assigned to a location, and then the interns are assigned to that location. So, the attending physician's identity doesn't affect the intern assignments beyond the location they are assigned to.Therefore, the number of ways is indeed 6.Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in combinatorics, when you have multiple constraints, you have to be careful about overcounting or undercounting.But in this case, since the only constraint is on intern A not being in location A, and we've accounted for that by ensuring that in each case, A is assigned to B, and then choosing the rest accordingly, it seems correct.Alternatively, let's list all possible allocations to verify.First, assign attending physicians:Option 1: Dr. X to A, Dr. Y to B.Now, assign interns:Location A needs 2 interns, cannot include A.Possible pairs for A: BC, BD, CD.So, 3 possibilities.Each corresponds to a unique allocation.Similarly, Option 2: Dr. Y to A, Dr. X to B.Again, assign interns:Location A needs 2 interns, cannot include A.Possible pairs: BC, BD, CD.So, another 3 possibilities.Total: 3 + 3 = 6.Yes, that's 6 allocations.Therefore, the answer should be 6.But wait, in the initial problem statement, it's mentioned that the two groups will be sent to locations A and B. So, each group is assigned to a specific location, meaning that the assignments are distinguishable based on the location.Therefore, the count is correct.Alternatively, if the groups were indistinct, meaning that swapping A and B doesn't create a new allocation, then the count would be different. But in this case, since they are assigned to specific locations, it's 6.Therefore, I think 6 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The total number of different allocation schemes is boxed{6}."},{"question":"The recruits stood in a row one behind the other, all facing the same direction.

In doing so, it turned out that in front of one of the brothers now stood four times as many people as in front of another brother. How many recruits might there be in total, including the brothers? List all possible options.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about three brothers—Peter, Nikolai, and Denis—who are standing in a row of recruits. Initially, they're all facing the same direction. The problem gives me the number of people ahead of each brother: 50 ahead of Peter, 100 ahead of Nikolai, and 170 ahead of Denis. Then, on the command \\"About-face!\\", everyone turns around, and now it turns out that in front of one of the brothers there are four times as many people as in front of another brother. I need to figure out how many recruits there might be in total, including the brothers. And I have to list all possible options.Alright, let me break this down step by step.First, let's visualize the initial setup. All recruits are in a row, facing the same direction—let's say forward. So, Peter has 50 people in front of him, Nikolai has 100, and Denis has 170. That means Peter is somewhere behind Nikolai, who is behind Denis, right? Because the more people ahead, the further back you are.Wait, actually, no. If Peter has 50 people ahead, that means he's the 51st person from the front. Similarly, Nikolai is the 101st person, and Denis is the 171st person. So, the order from front to back is: first 50 people, then Peter, then 50 to 100 people, then Nikolai, then 100 to 170 people, then Denis, and then the rest of the recruits.But wait, actually, the number of people ahead of each brother tells us their positions. So, if there are 50 people ahead of Peter, that means Peter is in position 51. Similarly, Nikolai is in position 101, and Denis is in position 171.So, the total number of recruits must be at least 171, because Denis is at position 171. But actually, there could be more people behind Denis as well. So, the total number of recruits is 171 plus the number of people behind Denis.But let's denote the total number of recruits as N. So, N is the total number, including the brothers.Now, when everyone turns around, they're all facing the opposite direction. So, the person who was at the front is now at the back, and vice versa. So, the positions from the front become positions from the back.So, after turning around, the number of people in front of each brother would be different. Let's think about this.Originally, Peter was at position 51, so after turning around, he would be at position N - 51 + 1 = N - 50. So, the number of people in front of him now would be N - 51.Similarly, Nikolai was at position 101, so after turning around, he is at position N - 101 + 1 = N - 100. So, the number of people in front of him is N - 101.Denis was at position 171, so after turning around, he is at position N - 171 + 1 = N - 170. So, the number of people in front of him is N - 171.Wait, let me make sure I got that right. If someone is at position k in a row of N people, after turning around, their new position is N - k + 1. So, the number of people in front of them would be N - k.Yes, that's correct. So, for Peter, originally at 51, after turning around, the number of people in front of him is N - 51. Similarly, Nikolai has N - 101, and Denis has N - 171.Now, the problem states that after turning around, in front of one of the brothers there are four times as many people as in front of another brother. So, we have three numbers: N - 51, N - 101, N - 171. One of these is four times another.So, we need to find N such that one of these expressions is four times another.Let me write down the three expressions:1. N - 512. N - 1013. N - 171We need to find N where one of these is four times another. So, let's consider all possible pairs:Case 1: N - 51 = 4*(N - 101)Case 2: N - 51 = 4*(N - 171)Case 3: N - 101 = 4*(N - 51)Case 4: N - 101 = 4*(N - 171)Case 5: N - 171 = 4*(N - 51)Case 6: N - 171 = 4*(N - 101)We can solve each case and see if N is a positive integer greater than 171, since there are at least 171 people.Let's go through each case.Case 1: N - 51 = 4*(N - 101)Expand the right side: 4N - 404So, N - 51 = 4N - 404Bring variables to one side: -51 + 404 = 4N - N353 = 3NN = 353 / 3 ≈ 117.666...But N must be an integer, and N must be at least 171. So, this case is invalid.Case 2: N - 51 = 4*(N - 171)Expand: 4N - 684So, N - 51 = 4N - 684Bring variables: -51 + 684 = 4N - N633 = 3NN = 633 / 3 = 211211 is an integer and greater than 171. So, this is a possible solution.Case 3: N - 101 = 4*(N - 51)Expand: 4N - 204So, N - 101 = 4N - 204Bring variables: -101 + 204 = 4N - N103 = 3NN = 103 / 3 ≈ 34.333...Not an integer and less than 171. Invalid.Case 4: N - 101 = 4*(N - 171)Expand: 4N - 684So, N - 101 = 4N - 684Bring variables: -101 + 684 = 4N - N583 = 3NN = 583 / 3 ≈ 194.333...Not an integer. So, invalid.Case 5: N - 171 = 4*(N - 51)Expand: 4N - 204So, N - 171 = 4N - 204Bring variables: -171 + 204 = 4N - N33 = 3NN = 11But N must be at least 171. So, invalid.Case 6: N - 171 = 4*(N - 101)Expand: 4N - 404So, N - 171 = 4N - 404Bring variables: -171 + 404 = 4N - N233 = 3NN = 233 / 3 ≈ 77.666...Not an integer and less than 171. Invalid.So, from all the cases, only Case 2 gives a valid integer solution: N = 211.Wait, but the problem says \\"how many recruits might there be in total, including the brothers? List all possible options.\\" So, is 211 the only possible solution?Wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have missed something.In Case 2, N - 51 = 4*(N - 171)So, N - 51 = 4N - 684Subtract N from both sides: -51 = 3N - 684Add 684 to both sides: 633 = 3NSo, N = 211. Correct.Is there any other case where N could be a different number? Let's see.Wait, maybe I should consider that the four times relationship could be in either direction. For example, maybe one brother has four times as many people in front as another, or the other way around. But in my cases above, I considered both possibilities because I set each expression equal to four times another. So, for example, in Case 1, I considered N - 51 = 4*(N - 101), which is Peter's front count being four times Nikolai's. In Case 3, I considered Nikolai's front count being four times Peter's. Similarly for the others.So, I think I covered all possible pairs and directions.Therefore, the only valid solution is N = 211.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that the four times relationship could involve the third brother as well? For example, maybe the number of people in front of one brother is four times another, and the third brother's count is something else. But the problem says \\"in front of one of the brothers now stood four times as many people as in front of another brother.\\" So, it's only comparing two brothers, not necessarily involving the third. So, my approach is correct.Therefore, the only possible total number of recruits is 211.But wait, let me check if N = 211 satisfies the condition.After turning around:Peter has N - 51 = 211 - 51 = 160 people in front.Nikolai has N - 101 = 211 - 101 = 110 people in front.Denis has N - 171 = 211 - 171 = 40 people in front.Now, checking if one is four times another:160 vs 110: 160 / 110 ≈ 1.45, not four times.160 vs 40: 160 / 40 = 4. Yes, that's four times.110 vs 40: 110 / 40 = 2.75, not four times.So, yes, Peter has four times as many people in front as Denis. So, that works.Is there any other possible N? Let me think.Wait, maybe I missed a case where the four times relationship is between Nikolai and Denis.Wait, in the above cases, I considered all possible pairs, so if N is such that Nikolai's front count is four times Denis's, that would be Case 6: N - 171 = 4*(N - 101), which gave N ≈77.666, which is invalid. Similarly, if Denis's front count is four times Nikolai's, that would be N - 101 = 4*(N - 171), which gave N ≈194.333, which is not integer.So, no, those don't give valid N.Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the four times relationship could involve the third brother in some way, but the problem only mentions two brothers. So, I think 211 is the only solution.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of people in front after turning around.Originally, Peter is at position 51, so after turning around, the number of people in front of him is N - 51. Similarly, Nikolai is at 101, so N - 101, and Denis at 171, so N - 171.Yes, that seems correct.Wait, another way to think about it: when you turn around, the number of people in front of you is equal to the number of people who were behind you before. So, for Peter, originally, there were 50 people ahead, so behind him, there were N - 51 people (since including himself, it's N - 50, but excluding himself, it's N - 51). So, after turning around, the number of people in front of him is N - 51.Similarly for the others.Yes, that's consistent.So, I think my initial conclusion is correct: N = 211 is the only possible total number of recruits.Wait, but the problem says \\"list all possible options,\\" implying there might be more than one. Did I miss something?Let me check if there are other cases where the four times relationship could hold.Wait, maybe I should consider that the four times could be in the other direction, i.e., one brother has 1/4 as many people in front as another. But in my cases above, I considered both possibilities because in each pair, I set one equal to four times the other, which covers both directions.For example, in Case 1, I set N - 51 = 4*(N - 101), which is Peter's front count being four times Nikolai's. In Case 3, I set N - 101 = 4*(N - 51), which is Nikolai's front count being four times Peter's. Similarly for the other pairs.So, I think I covered all possibilities.Wait, another thought: maybe the four times relationship is between the number of people behind one brother and the number of people in front of another. But no, the problem says \\"in front of one of the brothers now stood four times as many people as in front of another brother.\\" So, it's strictly about the number in front after turning around.So, I think 211 is the only solution.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.Wait, when you turn around, the number of people in front of you is equal to the number of people who were behind you before. So, for Peter, originally, there were 50 people ahead, so behind him, there were N - 51 people. So, after turning around, the number of people in front of him is N - 51.Similarly, Nikolai had 100 people ahead, so behind him were N - 101 people, which becomes the number in front after turning around.Denis had 170 people ahead, so behind him were N - 171 people, which becomes the number in front after turning around.Yes, that's correct.So, the three numbers are N - 51, N - 101, N - 171.We need one of these to be four times another.So, solving for each pair:1. N - 51 = 4*(N - 101) → N ≈117.666 invalid2. N - 51 = 4*(N - 171) → N=2113. N - 101 = 4*(N - 51) → N≈34.333 invalid4. N - 101 = 4*(N - 171) → N≈194.333 invalid5. N - 171 = 4*(N - 51) → N=11 invalid6. N - 171 = 4*(N - 101) → N≈77.666 invalidSo, only N=211 is valid.Therefore, the total number of recruits is 211.But wait, let me check if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe the four times relationship is not between two specific brothers, but any two of them. But I think I already considered all pairs.Alternatively, maybe the four times relationship could involve the number of people behind one brother and in front of another, but the problem says \\"in front of one of the brothers now stood four times as many people as in front of another brother.\\" So, it's strictly about the front counts after turning around.Therefore, I think 211 is the only solution.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should consider that the four times could be in either direction, but I think I already did that by considering both a = 4b and b = 4a for each pair.Yes, so I think 211 is the only possible total number of recruits."},{"question":"A number is said to be a palindrome if reading it from right to left is the same as reading it from left to right.

This sum must be divisible by 9.I'll then simplify the condition for divisibility. The equation 2A + 2B ≡ 0 (mod 9) can be reduced to A + B ≡ 0 (mod 9/2). Since A and B are integers, A + B must be a multiple of 9/2. However, because A and B are digits (0-9), the only feasible multiple is 9.Now, I'll determine the possible values for A and B. A can range from 1 to 9 (since it's the first digit of a 4-digit number), and B can range from 0 to 9. The equation A + B = 9 must be satisfied. This gives the following valid pairs:- A = 1, B = 8- A = 2, B = 7- A = 3, B = 6- A = 4, B = 5- A = 5, B = 4- A = 6, B = 3- A = 7, B = 2- A = 8, B = 1- A = 9, B = 0Finally, I'll count the number of valid combinations. There are 9 valid pairs of A and B that satisfy the conditions. Each pair corresponds to a unique 4-digit palindromic number divisible by 9.Therefore, there are 9 such numbers."},{"question":"Baron Munchausen claims that there exist two different 10-digit numbers, neither of which are divisible by 10, such that if the sum of the squares of the digits of each number is subtracted from the number, the results are the same. Is the baron telling the truth?","answer":"Alright, so I came across this interesting problem about Baron Munchausen claiming that there exist two different 10-digit numbers, neither of which are divisible by 10. The key point is that if you subtract the sum of the squares of their digits from each number, the results are the same. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, let's rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. We have two 10-digit numbers, let's call them N and M. Neither N nor M is divisible by 10, which means their last digits can't be zero. Now, if we take each number, calculate the sum of the squares of its digits, and subtract that sum from the original number, we get the same result for both N and M. So, mathematically, this can be written as:N - S(N) = M - S(M)Where S(N) is the sum of the squares of the digits of N, and similarly for S(M). Since N and M are different, this implies that N - M = S(N) - S(M). So, the difference between the two numbers is equal to the difference between the sums of the squares of their digits.Alright, so we need to find two such numbers N and M. Let's think about what this means. The difference N - M is equal to the difference in their digit squares sums. Since N and M are 10-digit numbers, their difference can be quite large, but the difference in the sums of their squares is limited by the number of digits and the possible values each digit can take.Each digit in a 10-digit number can be from 0 to 9, except the first digit which can't be 0 (since it's a 10-digit number). The sum of the squares of the digits, S(N), for a 10-digit number can range from a minimum of 1^2 + 9*0^2 = 1 (if the number is 1000000000) to a maximum of 10*9^2 = 810 (if all digits are 9). So, S(N) can vary between 1 and 810.Similarly, S(M) can also vary between 1 and 810. Therefore, the difference S(N) - S(M) can range from -809 to 809. That means the difference N - M must also lie within this range. However, since N and M are both 10-digit numbers, their difference can be as large as 9999999999 - 1000000000 = 8999999999, which is way beyond 809. So, that seems contradictory.Wait, hold on. If N and M are two different 10-digit numbers, their difference could be as small as 1 (like 1000000000 and 1000000001) or as large as almost 10^10. But according to the equation N - M = S(N) - S(M), the difference N - M is constrained by the difference in the sums of squares, which is at most 809. So, that suggests that N and M must be quite close to each other, differing by at most 809.But 809 is still a relatively small number compared to the magnitude of 10-digit numbers. So, maybe such numbers do exist. Let me think about how to approach this.Perhaps I can model this as a function. Let's define f(X) = X - S(X). Then, the problem is asking if there exist two different 10-digit numbers N and M such that f(N) = f(M). So, we're looking for two different inputs to the function f that result in the same output.This is similar to finding a collision in the function f. So, the question becomes: does the function f have collisions for 10-digit numbers? In other words, is f not injective over the set of 10-digit numbers?To determine this, I can analyze the behavior of f. Let's consider how f behaves as we increment a number. Suppose we have a number X and we increment it by 1 to get X+1. Then, f(X+1) = (X+1) - S(X+1). The change in f is f(X+1) - f(X) = (X+1 - S(X+1)) - (X - S(X)) = 1 - (S(X+1) - S(X)).So, the change in f when incrementing X by 1 is 1 minus the change in the sum of squares of the digits. Now, the change in S(X) when incrementing X depends on how the digits change. If the last digit is not 9, then only the last digit increments by 1, so S(X+1) - S(X) = (d+1)^2 - d^2 = 2d + 1, where d is the last digit. Therefore, the change in f would be 1 - (2d + 1) = -2d.If the last digit is 9, then incrementing causes a carry-over. For example, if the last k digits are 9, then incrementing X will turn those k digits into 0 and increment the (k+1)-th digit by 1. So, in this case, the change in S(X) is ( (digit_{k+1} + 1)^2 - digit_{k+1}^2 ) + (k * 0^2 - k * 9^2 ). That simplifies to (2*digit_{k+1} + 1) - 81k.Therefore, the change in f would be 1 - [ (2*digit_{k+1} + 1) - 81k ] = 1 - 2*digit_{k+1} - 1 + 81k = -2*digit_{k+1} + 81k.So, depending on how many trailing 9s a number has, the change in f can vary significantly. For numbers without trailing 9s, the change in f is negative, specifically -2d, which is between -18 (if d=9) and -2 (if d=1). For numbers with trailing 9s, the change in f can be positive if 81k > 2*digit_{k+1}. For example, if k=1, then 81*1=81, and 2*digit_{k+1} is at most 18 (if digit_{k+1}=9). So, 81 - 18 = 63, so the change in f would be +63. For k=2, 81*2=162, and 2*digit_{k+1} is still at most 18, so the change in f would be +144, and so on.This suggests that f is not strictly increasing or decreasing. It can increase or decrease depending on the number's digits. Therefore, it's possible for f to have collisions, meaning two different numbers can map to the same value.But how likely is that? Let's think about the number of possible outputs of f. Since f(X) = X - S(X), and X is a 10-digit number, f(X) can range from 1000000000 - 810 = 999999190 to 9999999999 - 1 = 9999999998. So, the range of f(X) is approximately 9*10^9, which is a huge number.However, the number of possible 10-digit numbers is 9*10^9 as well (from 1000000000 to 9999999999). So, if f were injective, each f(X) would correspond to exactly one X. But since f is not strictly increasing, it's possible that some f(X) values are repeated, leading to collisions.But is this actually the case? Let's think about the pigeonhole principle. If the number of possible f(X) values is less than the number of Xs, then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be collisions. However, in this case, the number of possible f(X) values is roughly the same as the number of Xs, so it's not immediately clear.Wait, actually, the range of f(X) is from about 10^9 to 10^10, which is 9*10^9 numbers. The number of 10-digit numbers is also 9*10^9. So, if f were a bijection, each f(X) would map to exactly one X. But since f is not strictly increasing, it's possible that some f(X) values are skipped, which would mean that the number of possible f(X) values is less than 9*10^9, leading to collisions.But is that the case? Let's think about how f(X) behaves. For most numbers, f(X) increases by 1 - (2d + 1) = -2d when you increment X by 1, which is a decrease. However, when there's a carry-over, f(X) can increase significantly. So, the function f(X) is mostly decreasing, but occasionally jumps up by a large amount.This suggests that f(X) is not injective because the function sometimes decreases and sometimes increases, potentially leading to overlaps where different Xs map to the same f(X).But to be more concrete, maybe I can look for specific examples or analyze the function more deeply.Let me consider a simpler case first. Suppose we have 2-digit numbers instead of 10-digit numbers. Maybe that can give me some intuition.For example, take N = 10 and M = 11. Neither is divisible by 10 (wait, 10 is divisible by 10, so that's not allowed). Let's take N = 12 and M = 13.Compute f(12) = 12 - (1^2 + 2^2) = 12 - (1 + 4) = 12 - 5 = 7.f(13) = 13 - (1 + 9) = 13 - 10 = 3.Not the same. Let's try N = 21 and M = 30.Wait, 30 is divisible by 10, so not allowed. Let's try N = 21 and M = 22.f(21) = 21 - (4 + 1) = 21 - 5 = 16.f(22) = 22 - (4 + 4) = 22 - 8 = 14.Still not the same. Hmm. Maybe I need to find two numbers where the difference between them is equal to the difference in their digit squares.Let me try N = 100 and M = 101.f(100) = 100 - (1 + 0 + 0) = 100 - 1 = 99.f(101) = 101 - (1 + 0 + 1) = 101 - 2 = 99.Oh! So, here we have two different numbers, 100 and 101, neither divisible by 10 (wait, 100 is divisible by 10, so that's not allowed). So, scratch that.Let me try N = 102 and M = 111.f(102) = 102 - (1 + 0 + 4) = 102 - 5 = 97.f(111) = 111 - (1 + 1 + 1) = 111 - 3 = 108.Not the same. Hmm.Wait, maybe I need to look for numbers where the change in digits when incremented causes a significant change in the sum of squares. For example, going from 199 to 200.Compute f(199) = 199 - (1 + 81 + 81) = 199 - 163 = 36.f(200) = 200 - (4 + 0 + 0) = 200 - 4 = 196.Not the same. Hmm.Wait, maybe I need to consider numbers where the digit changes cause the sum of squares to decrease by a certain amount when the number increases. For example, going from 119 to 120.f(119) = 119 - (1 + 1 + 81) = 119 - 83 = 36.f(120) = 120 - (1 + 4 + 0) = 120 - 5 = 115.Still not the same.Wait, maybe it's easier to construct such numbers. Let's suppose that N = M + k, where k is a positive integer. Then, according to the equation, N - S(N) = M - S(M), so (M + k) - S(M + k) = M - S(M). Simplifying, we get k = S(M + k) - S(M). So, the difference in the sums of squares must equal k.Therefore, if we can find a number M and a positive integer k such that when we add k to M, the sum of the squares of the digits increases by exactly k, then N = M + k will satisfy the condition.So, the problem reduces to finding M and k such that S(M + k) - S(M) = k.Now, let's think about how S(M + k) - S(M) can equal k. Since S(M + k) is the sum of squares of the digits of M + k, and S(M) is the sum for M, the difference depends on how adding k affects the digits.If adding k doesn't cause any carries, then each digit that is incremented contributes (d + 1)^2 - d^2 = 2d + 1 to the sum. So, if we increment t digits by 1, the total increase in the sum is sum_{i=1 to t} (2d_i + 1). Therefore, for no carries, the increase is 2*(sum of digits incremented) + t.But we need this increase to be equal to k. So, if we can find a number M where adding k increments t digits by 1 without causing any carries, and 2*(sum of digits incremented) + t = k, then we can have S(M + k) - S(M) = k.Alternatively, if adding k causes some carries, then the change in the sum can be more complicated. For example, if a digit is 9 and we add 1, it becomes 0, and we carry over to the next digit. So, the change in the sum for that digit is 0^2 - 9^2 = -81, and the next digit is incremented by 1, contributing (d + 1)^2 - d^2 = 2d + 1. So, the net change is -81 + 2d + 1 = 2d - 80.If multiple digits are 9, the change can be even more negative. For example, if two trailing digits are 9, adding 1 turns them into 00 and increments the third digit. The change in the sum is 0^2 + 0^2 - 9^2 - 9^2 + (d + 1)^2 - d^2 = -81 -81 + 2d + 1 = 2d - 161.So, in cases where adding k causes multiple carries, the change in the sum can be negative or positive depending on how many digits are carried over and the value of the digit that gets incremented.This seems complicated, but maybe we can find a case where the change in the sum equals k. Let's try to construct such a case.Suppose we have a number M that ends with a bunch of 9s. Let's say M ends with t 9s. Then, adding 1 to M will turn those t 9s into 0s and increment the (t+1)-th digit by 1. The change in the sum S(M + 1) - S(M) would be:- For each of the t 9s: 0^2 - 9^2 = -81 each, so total change from these digits is -81t.- For the (t+1)-th digit: if it was d, it becomes d + 1, so the change is (d + 1)^2 - d^2 = 2d + 1.Therefore, total change is -81t + 2d + 1.We want this change to be equal to k, which in this case is 1 (since we added 1). So,-81t + 2d + 1 = 1Simplify:-81t + 2d = 0Which implies:2d = 81tBut 81t must be even, so t must be even because 81 is odd. Let's try t=2:2d = 81*2 = 162 => d = 81, which is impossible because d is a single digit (0-9).t=4:2d = 81*4 = 324 => d=162, still impossible.So, this approach doesn't work. Maybe adding more than 1?Wait, let's consider adding k=81t - (2d + 1). If we can find t and d such that k is positive and manageable.Wait, perhaps instead of adding 1, we can add a larger k to cause multiple carries. Let's think about adding k=81t - (2d + 1). Hmm, this might not be straightforward.Alternatively, let's think about a number M where adding k causes a single digit to roll over from 9 to 0, and another digit to increment. For example, M = ...x9, adding k=1 turns it into ...(x+1)0. The change in sum is (x+1)^2 - x^2 + 0^2 - 9^2 = (2x + 1) - 81 = 2x - 80.We want this change to be equal to k=1, so:2x - 80 = 1 => 2x = 81 => x=40.5, which is not possible since x is a digit (0-9).So, that doesn't work. What if we add k=2?Then, the change in sum would be 2x - 80, and we set that equal to 2:2x - 80 = 2 => 2x = 82 => x=41, which is still not a digit.Similarly, for k=3:2x - 80 = 3 => x=41.5, nope.Wait, maybe adding k=81 - (2x +1). Let's see:If we want S(M + k) - S(M) = k, and the change due to a single carry is 2x - 80, then:2x - 80 = kBut k must be positive, so 2x - 80 > 0 => x > 40, which is impossible.So, single carry doesn't help. What about multiple carries?Suppose we have two trailing 9s. Adding k=1 turns them into 00 and increments the third digit. The change in sum is:-81*2 + (d+1)^2 - d^2 = -162 + 2d +1 = 2d - 161.We want this to equal k=1:2d - 161 = 1 => 2d = 162 => d=81, which is impossible.Similarly, for k=2:2d - 161 = 2 => 2d=163 => d=81.5, nope.k=3:2d=164 => d=82, nope.This isn't working either.Wait, maybe if we have more trailing 9s. Let's say t trailing 9s. Then, the change in sum is:-81t + 2d +1.We want this equal to k=1:-81t + 2d +1 =1 => -81t + 2d =0 => 2d=81t.Again, t must be even, but 81t is even only if t is even, but 81 is odd, so 81t is even only when t is even. Let's try t=2:2d=162 => d=81, impossible.t=4:2d=324 => d=162, impossible.Same issue.Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let's think differently.Instead of trying to find M and k such that S(M + k) - S(M) = k, maybe we can look for numbers where the sum of squares of digits is equal to the number minus some constant. That is, f(N) = f(M) => N - S(N) = M - S(M) => N - M = S(N) - S(M).So, the difference between N and M is equal to the difference in their digit squares sums. Since N and M are 10-digit numbers, their difference can be up to around 10^10, but the difference in digit squares sums is limited to about 810 - 1 = 809.Therefore, N and M must be very close to each other, differing by at most 809. So, perhaps we can look for two 10-digit numbers that are close to each other, and their digit squares sums differ by exactly their difference.Given that, maybe such numbers exist. For example, consider two numbers that differ by 1, but their digit squares sums differ by 1 as well. Is that possible?Let's take N and M = N + 1. Then, S(N + 1) - S(N) = 1. Is this possible?If adding 1 to N doesn't cause any carries, then S(N + 1) = S(N) + (d + 1)^2 - d^2 = S(N) + 2d + 1. So, the difference would be 2d + 1, which is at least 1 (if d=0) and at most 19 (if d=9). So, if d=0, then S(N + 1) - S(N) = 1, which is exactly what we need.Therefore, if N ends with a 0, then M = N + 1 will have S(M) - S(N) = 1, so N - S(N) = M - S(M). Therefore, N and M would satisfy the condition.Wait, but the problem states that neither N nor M can be divisible by 10. So, if N ends with a 0, then N is divisible by 10, which is not allowed. Similarly, M = N + 1 would end with 1, so M is not divisible by 10. But N is divisible by 10, which violates the condition.Therefore, we need to find two numbers N and M where neither ends with 0, but N - M = S(N) - S(M). So, let's see if such numbers exist.Suppose N and M differ by k, where k = S(N) - S(M). So, N = M + k, and S(N) = S(M) + k.We need to find M such that when we add k to it, the sum of the squares of its digits increases by exactly k.Let me try to construct such numbers.Let's consider a number M that ends with a digit d, and when we add k, it causes a carry-over that affects the digit sum in such a way that the total increase is k.For example, suppose M ends with 9. Adding 1 turns it into 0 and increments the next digit. The change in the sum is 0^2 - 9^2 + (d + 1)^2 - d^2 = -81 + 2d + 1 = 2d - 80.If we set this equal to k=1, then 2d - 80 = 1 => d=40.5, which is impossible. So, that doesn't work.What if we add k=81? Then, 2d - 80 = 81 => 2d=161 => d=80.5, still impossible.Wait, maybe adding k=81 - (2d +1). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, let's consider adding k=100. Suppose M is such that adding 100 causes two trailing digits to change. For example, M = ...x99, adding 100 turns it into ...(x+1)00. The change in the sum is:For the last two digits: 0^2 + 0^2 - 9^2 - 9^2 = -81 -81 = -162.For the third digit: (x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x +1.So, total change is -162 + 2x +1 = 2x - 161.We want this equal to k=100:2x - 161 = 100 => 2x = 261 => x=130.5, which is impossible.Hmm, not helpful.Wait, maybe if we add k=81. Let's see:2x - 161 = 81 => 2x=242 => x=121, still too big.Alternatively, maybe adding k=81*2=162:2x - 161 = 162 => 2x=323 => x=161.5, nope.This approach isn't working. Let's think differently.Perhaps instead of trying to cause carries, we can find numbers where the digits change in a way that the sum of squares increases by exactly k when we add k.For example, suppose M ends with digit d, and adding k increments d by 1 without carry-over. Then, S(M + k) - S(M) = (d + 1)^2 - d^2 = 2d + 1. So, if we set 2d + 1 = k, then adding k=2d +1 would satisfy the condition.But since k must be equal to N - M, which is 1 in this case (since we're only changing the last digit by 1). Wait, no, if we add k=2d +1, then N = M + (2d +1). So, the difference is 2d +1, and the sum increases by 2d +1, so it works.But wait, in this case, N = M + (2d +1), and S(N) = S(M) + (2d +1). So, N - S(N) = M + (2d +1) - (S(M) + 2d +1) = M - S(M). Therefore, f(N) = f(M). So, this works.But we need to ensure that neither N nor M is divisible by 10. So, M cannot end with 0, and N = M + (2d +1) also cannot end with 0.Let's try an example. Let M be a 10-digit number ending with d=1. Then, k=2*1 +1=3. So, N = M +3. The last digit of M is 1, so adding 3 makes it 4, no carry-over. Therefore, S(N) = S(M) + (4^2 - 1^2) = S(M) + (16 -1)= S(M) +15. Wait, but k=3, so we need S(N) - S(M)=3, but in this case, it's 15. So, that doesn't work.Wait, I think I made a mistake. If M ends with d, then adding k=2d +1 would increment the last digit by 1, but only if d +1 doesn't cause a carry. So, if d +1 <10, then yes, but if d +1=10, it causes a carry.Wait, no, in this case, we're adding k=2d +1, not 1. So, if M ends with d, adding k=2d +1 would change the last digit to d + (2d +1). Wait, no, adding k=2d +1 to M would affect all digits, not just the last one. So, this approach might not be straightforward.Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently. If I add k=2d +1 to M, and M ends with d, then the last digit becomes d + (2d +1). But that would cause a carry if d + (2d +1) >=10.Wait, no, adding k=2d +1 to M is not just adding to the last digit, it's adding to the entire number. So, the change in the last digit depends on how the addition propagates.This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to consider a specific example.Let me try M = 1000000001 (which is a 10-digit number, not divisible by 10). Let d=1 (last digit). Then, k=2*1 +1=3. So, N = M +3 = 1000000004.Compute S(M) = 1^2 + 0 + ... + 0 +1^2 = 1 +1=2.S(N) =1^2 +0 + ... +0 +4^2=1 +16=17.So, S(N) - S(M)=17 -2=15, which is not equal to k=3. So, this doesn't work.Wait, so my earlier reasoning was flawed. Adding k=2d +1 doesn't necessarily result in S(N) - S(M)=k because the addition affects all digits, not just the last one.So, maybe this approach isn't valid. Let's think again.Perhaps instead of trying to increment a single digit, we need to find numbers where the change in digits when adding k results in a net increase in the sum of squares equal to k.For example, suppose M ends with 3, and adding k=5 turns it into 8, so the last digit increases by 5. Then, the change in the sum is 8^2 - 3^2=64 -9=55. So, if k=5, then S(N) - S(M)=55, which is much larger than k=5. So, that doesn't help.Alternatively, if M ends with 8, and adding k=2 turns it into 0 with a carry-over. So, the last digit changes from 8 to 0, and the next digit increments by 1. The change in the sum is 0^2 -8^2 + (d+1)^2 -d^2= -64 +2d +1=2d -63.If we set this equal to k=2:2d -63=2 =>2d=65 =>d=32.5, impossible.Hmm.Wait, maybe if we have a number where adding k causes multiple digits to change in such a way that the total change in the sum is k.For example, suppose M ends with 99, and adding k=2 turns it into 01 with a carry-over. So, the last two digits go from 99 to 01, and the third digit increments by 1.The change in the sum is:For the last two digits: 0^2 +1^2 -9^2 -9^2=0 +1 -81 -81= -161.For the third digit: (d +1)^2 -d^2=2d +1.Total change: -161 +2d +1=2d -160.We want this equal to k=2:2d -160=2 =>2d=162 =>d=81, which is impossible.Alternatively, k=162:2d -160=162 =>2d=322 =>d=161, still impossible.This isn't working either.Wait, maybe if we have a number where adding k=1 causes a carry-over that affects multiple digits, but the total change in the sum is 1.For example, M ends with 999, adding 1 turns it into 000 with a carry-over to the fourth digit.Change in sum:Last three digits: 0 +0 +0 -9 -9 -9= -27.Fourth digit: (d +1)^2 -d^2=2d +1.Total change: -27 +2d +1=2d -26.Set equal to k=1:2d -26=1 =>2d=27 =>d=13.5, impossible.Hmm.Wait, maybe if we have a number where adding k=81 causes a carry-over that reduces the sum by 81, but increases another digit's square by 81, resulting in a net change of 0. But that would mean S(N) - S(M)=0, so k=0, which isn't allowed since N and M must be different.Alternatively, if adding k=81 causes the sum to increase by 81, which would require that the digit that gets incremented contributes exactly 81 more, but that's only possible if that digit was 0 and becomes 9, but 9^2 -0^2=81. So, if M has a 0 in some digit, and adding k=81 increments that digit to 9 without affecting others, then S(N) - S(M)=81, so k=81.But adding 81 to M would affect multiple digits, not just one. For example, if M ends with 000, adding 81 would turn it into 081, but that would require M to be ...000, which is divisible by 10, which is not allowed.Wait, but M can't end with 0, but it can have 0s in other digits. For example, M = 1000000001. Adding 81 would make it 1000000082. The change in the sum is:Original sum:1 +0 +...+0 +1=2.New sum:1 +0 +...+0 +8^2 +2^2=1 +64 +4=69.So, S(N) - S(M)=69 -2=67, which is not equal to k=81.Hmm.Wait, maybe if M has a 0 in the third digit from the end, and adding k=81 increments that digit to 9, while the last two digits wrap around. For example, M = ...x00, adding 81 turns it into ...(x+1)81. The change in the sum is:For the third digit: (x +1)^2 -x^2=2x +1.For the last two digits:8^2 +1^2 -0 -0=64 +1=65.Total change:2x +1 +65=2x +66.We want this equal to k=81:2x +66=81 =>2x=15 =>x=7.5, which is not an integer.So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, if M has a 0 in the fourth digit from the end, and adding 81 increments that digit to 9, while the last three digits wrap around. The change in the sum would be:Fourth digit: (x +1)^2 -x^2=2x +1.Last three digits: 0 +0 +0 -9 -9 -9= -27.Total change:2x +1 -27=2x -26.Set equal to k=81:2x -26=81 =>2x=107 =>x=53.5, impossible.This isn't working either.I'm starting to think that maybe such numbers don't exist, but the problem says Baron Munchausen claims they do. So, perhaps I'm missing something.Wait, maybe instead of trying to find N and M that differ by k and have S(N) - S(M)=k, I should consider that the function f(X) = X - S(X) is not injective, so there must be collisions. Since the number of possible f(X) values is about 9*10^9, and the number of Xs is also 9*10^9, but f(X) is not strictly increasing, it's possible that some values are repeated.But to be sure, maybe I can calculate the number of possible f(X) values. The minimum f(X) is 1000000000 - 810 = 999999190, and the maximum is 9999999999 -1=9999999998. So, the range is 9999999998 - 999999190 +1= approximately 9*10^9, which is the same as the number of 10-digit numbers. So, if f were a bijection, each f(X) would be unique. But since f is not strictly increasing, it's possible that some f(X) are repeated, leading to collisions.Therefore, by the pigeonhole principle, since f is not injective, there must exist at least two different numbers N and M such that f(N)=f(M). Hence, Baron Munchausen is telling the truth.Wait, but the problem specifies that neither N nor M is divisible by 10. So, even if f is not injective overall, maybe all collisions involve numbers divisible by 10. But I don't think so, because the function f depends on all digits, not just the last one. So, it's likely that there are collisions among numbers not divisible by 10.Therefore, the answer is yes, the baron is telling the truth."},{"question":"Polina custom makes jewelry for a jewelry store. Each piece of jewelry consists of a chain, a stone, and a pendant. The chains can be silver, gold, or iron. Polina has stones - cubic zirconia, emerald, quartz - and pendants in the shape of a star, sun, and moon. Polina is happy only when three pieces of jewelry are laid out in a row from left to right on the showcase according to the following rules:- There must be a piece of jewelry with a sun pendant on an iron chain.- Next to the jewelry with the sun pendant there must be gold and silver jewelry.- The three pieces of jewelry in the row must have different stones, pendants, and chains.How many ways are there to make Polina happy?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where Polina makes custom jewelry, and she wants three pieces arranged in a row on a showcase. Each piece has a chain, a stone, and a pendant. The chains can be silver, gold, or iron. The stones are cubic zirconia, emerald, or quartz. The pendants are star, sun, or moon. Polina is happy only if three pieces are laid out according to specific rules. Let me try to parse these rules one by one.First rule: There must be a piece of jewelry with a sun pendant on an iron chain. So, one of the three pieces must have both a sun pendant and an iron chain. That seems straightforward.Second rule: Next to the jewelry with the sun pendant, there must be gold and silver jewelry. Hmm, so the piece with the sun pendant must be adjacent to both a gold and a silver chain. That means the sun pendant piece can't be at one end because it needs neighbors on both sides. Wait, but in a row of three, the middle piece has neighbors on both sides, while the end pieces only have one neighbor. So, does that mean the sun pendant must be in the middle? Because if it's on the end, it can only have one neighbor, which can't be both gold and silver. So, that suggests the sun pendant must be in the middle position.Third rule: The three pieces must have different stones, pendants, and chains. So, all three stones are different, all three pendants are different, and all three chains are different. So, each piece has unique stone, pendant, and chain.So, let me try to structure this.First, since the sun pendant must be on an iron chain, and it must be in the middle, let's fix that position. So, position 2 is sun pendant, iron chain.Now, the pieces on positions 1 and 3 must be next to the sun pendant. According to the second rule, these two pieces must be gold and silver. So, one of them is gold, the other is silver. So, position 1 and 3 have chains of gold and silver, but we don't know which is which yet.Additionally, all three pieces must have different stones, pendants, and chains. So, each stone, pendant, and chain must be unique across the three pieces.Let me break this down step by step.1. Fix the middle piece: chain is iron, pendant is sun. So, we need to assign a stone to this piece. The stones are cubic zirconia, emerald, and quartz. So, there are 3 choices for the stone in the middle.2. Now, for the first and third positions, their chains must be gold and silver. So, we can assign gold to position 1 and silver to position 3, or silver to position 1 and gold to position 3. So, that's 2 possibilities.3. Next, the pendants. The middle piece has a sun pendant, so the other two pendants must be star and moon. So, we need to assign star and moon to positions 1 and 3. Again, two possibilities: position 1 is star and position 3 is moon, or position 1 is moon and position 3 is star.4. Now, the stones. The middle piece has one stone, so the remaining two stones must be assigned to positions 1 and 3. Since all stones must be different, we have two stones left, and two positions. So, that's another 2 possibilities.So, putting it all together:- 3 choices for the stone in the middle.- 2 choices for the chain arrangement (gold and silver).- 2 choices for the pendant arrangement (star and moon).- 2 choices for the stone arrangement (remaining two stones).So, the total number of ways is 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24.Wait, but hold on. Is that all? Let me make sure I haven't missed any constraints.Each piece must have a unique stone, pendant, and chain. So, in addition to the assignments above, we need to ensure that no two pieces share the same stone, pendant, or chain.But in the way I broke it down, we already assigned unique stones, pendants, and chains. Because:- Chains: middle is iron, positions 1 and 3 are gold and silver, which are unique.- Pendants: middle is sun, positions 1 and 3 are star and moon, which are unique.- Stones: middle has one, positions 1 and 3 have the other two, which are unique.So, that seems to satisfy all the constraints.But let me think again. Is there any overlap or something I missed?Wait, another thought: when assigning the stones, do we have to consider the permutations? Because the stones are assigned to positions 1 and 3, but depending on the chain and pendant assignments, could that affect the stone assignments? Hmm, no, because the stones are independent of the chains and pendants. So, regardless of how we assign chains and pendants, the stones just need to be different. So, once we fix the middle stone, the other two stones can be assigned in 2 ways.So, yeah, 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24.But wait, hold on. Let me think about the chain assignments. The second rule says that next to the sun pendant, there must be gold and silver jewelry. So, the two adjacent pieces must be gold and silver. So, that's why we have two possibilities for the chains: gold and silver in positions 1 and 3.But in terms of the entire arrangement, is there any other constraint? For example, the stones and pendants must also be unique across all three pieces, but we've already considered that.Wait, another thought: when we assign the pendants, we have to make sure that the pendants are unique. Since the middle is sun, the other two must be star and moon, which are unique. Similarly, chains are unique: iron, gold, silver.Same with stones: each piece has a unique stone.So, I think 24 is correct.But let me try to visualize it.Middle piece: iron chain, sun pendant, stone A.Positions 1 and 3: chains are gold and silver, pendants are star and moon, stones are B and C.So, for each stone A (3 choices), we can assign the chains to positions 1 and 3 in 2 ways, pendants in 2 ways, and stones in 2 ways. So, 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24.Yes, that seems correct.Wait, but hold on another thing. Is the assignment of stones dependent on the assignment of pendants or chains? For example, does a particular stone have to go with a particular pendant or chain? The problem doesn't specify any such constraints, so I think the stones can be assigned independently.So, in that case, the total number is indeed 24.But let me see if I can think of another way to compute it.Alternatively, we can think of it as permutations.We have three positions: 1, 2, 3.We know that position 2 must be iron chain and sun pendant. So, we fix that.Then, for position 1 and 3, we need to assign the remaining chains (gold and silver), pendants (star and moon), and stones (the two remaining stones).So, for each of these, it's a matter of assigning two items to two positions.So, for chains: 2 choices (gold in 1, silver in 3 or vice versa).For pendants: 2 choices (star in 1, moon in 3 or vice versa).For stones: 2 choices (stone X in 1, stone Y in 3 or vice versa).And for the middle stone, 3 choices.So, 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24.Yes, same result.Alternatively, another approach: think of the entire arrangement as a permutation.We have three chains: iron, gold, silver. Since position 2 must be iron, the other two are gold and silver in positions 1 and 3: 2 possibilities.Similarly, pendants: sun is fixed in position 2, so star and moon in positions 1 and 3: 2 possibilities.Stones: three different stones, one in each position. Since position 2 has one stone, the other two are assigned to positions 1 and 3: 2 possibilities.So, again, 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 = 24.Wait, no, actually, the stones are assigned independently, so it's 3 choices for the stone in position 2, and then 2! = 2 ways to assign the remaining stones to positions 1 and 3.So, 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24.Yes, consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:Total number of ways without any constraints: 3! * 3! * 3! = 6 * 6 * 6 = 216. But that's without considering the specific rules.But with the constraints, it's much less.But since we have specific constraints, it's better to approach it as above.So, to recap:- Fix position 2: iron chain, sun pendant. Assign a stone to it: 3 choices.- Assign chains to positions 1 and 3: gold and silver. 2 possibilities.- Assign pendants to positions 1 and 3: star and moon. 2 possibilities.- Assign stones to positions 1 and 3: the remaining two stones. 2 possibilities.Multiply all together: 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24.So, I think that's the answer.But just to make sure, let me think if there's any overcounting or undercounting.Is there any case where two different assignments result in the same arrangement? I don't think so because each choice is independent and we're considering all permutations.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as arranging the chains, pendants, and stones separately.Chains:- Position 2 is fixed as iron. Positions 1 and 3 are gold and silver. So, 2 possibilities.Pendants:- Position 2 is fixed as sun. Positions 1 and 3 are star and moon. So, 2 possibilities.Stones:- Position 2 has one of the three stones. Positions 1 and 3 have the other two, so 2 possibilities.So, total arrangements: 2 (chains) * 2 (pendants) * 3 (stones in position 2) * 2 (stones in positions 1 and 3) = 24.Yes, same result.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as permutations.We have three positions, each with a unique chain, pendant, and stone.But position 2 is fixed in terms of chain and pendant, but not in terms of stone.So, the number of permutations is:For chains: 2! = 2 (positions 1 and 3).For pendants: 2! = 2 (positions 1 and 3).For stones: 3 choices for position 2, then 2! = 2 for positions 1 and 3.So, total: 2 * 2 * 3 * 2 = 24.Same answer.I think 24 is correct.Wait, but another thought: does the second rule specify that next to the sun pendant, there must be both gold and silver? So, does that mean that on one side is gold and the other is silver? So, in that case, the two adjacent pieces must be one gold and one silver, but not necessarily in any specific order.So, that's why we have 2 possibilities for the chains.Similarly, for the pendants, the two adjacent pieces must be star and moon, but not necessarily in any specific order, so 2 possibilities.Same with the stones: the two adjacent pieces must be the remaining two stones, but not necessarily in any specific order, so 2 possibilities.So, yeah, 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 = 24.I think that's solid.So, the answer is 24.**Final Answer**The number of ways to make Polina happy is boxed{24}."},{"question":"Define a new operation using \\"☆\\" and \\"★\\": For any rational numbers a and b, we have a☆b=a^{b} and a★b=b^{a}.

When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with \`\`change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a 390 debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where two farmers agree on the worth of pigs and goats. A pig is worth 300 and a goat is worth 210. When one farmer owes the other money, they settle the debt using pigs or goats, with change given if necessary. The question is asking for the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way.Hmm, okay. So, I think this is related to something called the greatest common divisor (GCD). I remember that the GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. But in this case, we're looking for the smallest positive debt that can be made using combinations of pigs and goats. So, maybe it's the GCD of 300 and 210?Let me recall how to compute the GCD. One method is the Euclidean algorithm. Let me try that.First, divide 300 by 210. 300 ÷ 210 = 1 with a remainder of 90. So, GCD(300, 210) is the same as GCD(210, 90).Now, divide 210 by 90.210 ÷ 90 = 2 with a remainder of 30.So, GCD(210, 90) is the same as GCD(90, 30).Next, divide 90 by 30.90 ÷ 30 = 3 with a remainder of 0.Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is 30.So, does that mean the smallest positive debt is 30? That seems plausible, but let me think again.Wait, the problem says that when one farmer owes the other, they pay in pigs or goats, with change received as necessary. So, for example, a 390 debt can be paid with two pigs (which is 600) and receive one goat as change (210), so 600 - 210 = 390.So, essentially, the debt can be expressed as a linear combination of 300 and 210, where the coefficients can be positive or negative, representing the number of pigs given or received as change.So, mathematically, the debt D can be written as:D = 300x + 210ywhere x and y are integers (they can be positive or negative, depending on who is giving or receiving the animals).Therefore, the smallest positive D is the GCD of 300 and 210, which we found to be 30. So, the smallest positive debt is 30.But just to make sure, let me see if I can actually get 30 using pigs and goats.So, we need to find integers x and y such that 300x + 210y = 30.Let me simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 30:10x + 7y = 1So, now I need to solve 10x + 7y = 1 for integers x and y.This is a linear Diophantine equation. The solutions can be found using the extended Euclidean algorithm.First, let's find integers x and y such that 10x + 7y = 1.Using the extended Euclidean algorithm on 10 and 7:10 = 1*7 + 37 = 2*3 + 13 = 3*1 + 0So, the GCD is 1, which we already knew.Now, working backwards:1 = 7 - 2*3But 3 = 10 - 1*7, so substitute:1 = 7 - 2*(10 - 1*7) = 7 - 2*10 + 2*7 = 3*7 - 2*10So, 1 = 3*7 - 2*10Therefore, x = -2 and y = 3 is a solution.So, scaling back up by 30:D = 300*(-2) + 210*3 = -600 + 630 = 30.So, yes, that works. So, a debt of 30 can be settled by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs as change.But wait, in the context of the problem, when you pay a debt, you give the animals and receive change if necessary. So, if I owe someone 30, I can give them 3 goats (which is 630) and receive 2 pigs as change (which is 600). So, 630 - 600 = 30. That works.Alternatively, if I have to receive 3 goats and give 2 pigs, but in terms of debt, it's the same as the net amount.Therefore, the smallest positive debt is indeed 30.Just to check if there's a smaller positive debt, say 15. Is that possible?Let me see if 15 can be expressed as a combination of 300 and 210.So, 300x + 210y = 15.Divide both sides by 15:20x + 14y = 1Simplify further by dividing by 2:10x + 7y = 0.5But x and y have to be integers, so 10x + 7y can't be a fraction. Therefore, 15 is not possible.Similarly, trying 10:300x + 210y = 10Divide by 10:30x + 21y = 1Again, 30x + 21y must be an integer, but 1 is not a multiple of GCD(30,21)=3. So, no solution.So, 30 is indeed the smallest positive debt.Therefore, the answer is boxed{30}.**Final Answer**The smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way is boxed{30} dollars."},{"question":"Distribute 5 identical balls to 3 children in such a way that each child receives at least one ball.

The conditions provided are ( frac{1}{p} + frac{1}{q} = 1 ) and ( pq = frac{9}{2} ). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that ( p ) and ( q ) are both greater than 1, and ( p ) is less than ( q ). So, they're both positive numbers, which is good because that means I don't have to worry about negative values complicating things.The two equations given are:1. ( frac{1}{p} + frac{1}{q} = 1 )2. ( pq = frac{9}{2} )I need to solve for ( q ). Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute it into the second equation. Let me try that.Starting with the first equation:( frac{1}{p} + frac{1}{q} = 1 )I can combine the fractions:( frac{q + p}{pq} = 1 )Since ( pq = frac{9}{2} ), I can substitute that into the equation:( frac{p + q}{frac{9}{2}} = 1 )Multiplying both sides by ( frac{9}{2} ):( p + q = frac{9}{2} )Okay, so now I have another equation: ( p + q = frac{9}{2} ). So, now I have a system of two equations:1. ( p + q = frac{9}{2} )2. ( pq = frac{9}{2} )This looks like a system of equations that can be solved using substitution or maybe quadratic equations. Let me think.If I let ( p ) and ( q ) be the roots of a quadratic equation, then the sum of the roots is ( frac{9}{2} ) and the product is ( frac{9}{2} ). So, the quadratic equation would be:( x^2 - (p + q)x + pq = 0 )Substituting the known values:( x^2 - frac{9}{2}x + frac{9}{2} = 0 )Let me write that down:( x^2 - frac{9}{2}x + frac{9}{2} = 0 )To make it easier, I can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fractions:( 2x^2 - 9x + 9 = 0 )Now, I have a quadratic equation:( 2x^2 - 9x + 9 = 0 )I can try to factor this, but I'm not sure if it factors nicely. Let me check the discriminant to see if it has real roots.The discriminant ( D ) is ( b^2 - 4ac ).Here, ( a = 2 ), ( b = -9 ), ( c = 9 ).So,( D = (-9)^2 - 4(2)(9) = 81 - 72 = 9 )Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real roots. That's good because we're told ( p ) and ( q ) are real numbers.Now, using the quadratic formula:( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{D}}{2a} )Plugging in the values:( x = frac{-(-9) pm sqrt{9}}{2(2)} = frac{9 pm 3}{4} )So, the two solutions are:1. ( x = frac{9 + 3}{4} = frac{12}{4} = 3 )2. ( x = frac{9 - 3}{4} = frac{6}{4} = frac{3}{2} )So, the roots are ( x = 3 ) and ( x = frac{3}{2} ).But wait, we were told that ( 1 < p < q ). So, ( p ) is the smaller one and ( q ) is the larger one.Therefore, ( p = frac{3}{2} ) and ( q = 3 ).Let me just verify that these satisfy both original equations.First, ( pq = frac{3}{2} times 3 = frac{9}{2} ). That's correct.Second, ( frac{1}{p} + frac{1}{q} = frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{3} = 1 ). That's also correct.So, everything checks out. Therefore, the value of ( q ) is 3.**Final Answer**The value of ( q ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = 2^x + x - 8 has a root x, and x in (k, k+1), then the integer k =  .","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = 2^x + x - 8, and I need to find an integer k such that the root x is between k and k+1.

So, I need to find x such that 2^x + x - 8 = 0. That means 2^x + x = 8. I think I can approach this by testing integer values of x and see where the function crosses zero.

So, maybe I can use the Intermediate Value Theorem, which says that if a function is continuous on [a, b] and takes values f(a) and f(b) at each end of the interval, then it also takes any value between f(a) and f(b) at some point in between.First, I should check if the function is continuous. Well, 2^x is continuous everywhere, and x - 8 is also continuous everywhere. So, their sum is continuous. That means I can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem.Now, let me try plugging in some integer values for x and see what f(x) is.Let's start with x = 0: f(0) = 2^0 + 0 - 8 = 1 + 0 - 8 = -7. That's negative.x = 1: f(1) = 2^1 + 1 - 8 = 2 + 1 - 8 = -5. Still negative.x = 2: f(2) = 4 + 2 - 8 = -2. Hmm, still negative.x = 3: f(3) = 8 + 3 - 8 = 3. Okay, that's positive. So, f(3) is positive.So, between x=2 and x=3, the function goes from negative to positive. That means, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root between 2 and 3. So, k should be 2 because the root is in (2, 3).Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should calculate f(2) and f(3) again.f(2) = 2^2 + 2 - 8 = 4 + 2 - 8 = -2. Yep, that's correct.f(3) = 2^3 + 3 - 8 = 8 + 3 - 8 = 3. Correct again.So, since f(2) is negative and f(3) is positive, the root is between 2 and 3. Therefore, k is 2.But just to be thorough, maybe I should check x=4 as well, to see how the function behaves beyond that.f(4) = 16 + 4 - 8 = 12. That's positive, and it's increasing as x increases. So, the function is increasing, which makes sense because both 2^x and x are increasing functions.What about x=1? f(1) was -5, and x=0 was -7. So, it's increasing as x increases, which is consistent.Wait, just to make sure, is the function strictly increasing? Let me check the derivative. The derivative of f(x) is f’(x) = ln(2)*2^x + 1. Since ln(2) is positive and 2^x is always positive, f’(x) is always positive. So, yes, the function is strictly increasing. Therefore, there's only one root, and it's between 2 and 3.So, k must be 2.But just to get a better idea, maybe I can approximate the root a bit more. Let's try x=2.5.f(2.5) = 2^2.5 + 2.5 - 8. 2^2 is 4, 2^0.5 is sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, so 2^2.5 = 4 * 1.414 ≈ 5.656. So, f(2.5) ≈ 5.656 + 2.5 - 8 ≈ 8.156 - 8 = 0.156. That's positive.So, f(2.5) is positive. So, the root is between 2 and 2.5.Wait, let me check f(2.3):2^2.3 is approximately... Hmm, 2^2 is 4, 2^0.3 is approximately 1.231 (since 2^0.3 = e^{0.3 ln2} ≈ e^{0.2075} ≈ 1.231). So, 2^2.3 ≈ 4 * 1.231 ≈ 4.924. Then, f(2.3) ≈ 4.924 + 2.3 - 8 ≈ 7.224 - 8 ≈ -0.776. That's negative.Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 2^2.3 is actually higher than that. Wait, 2^0.3 is approximately 1.231, so 2^2.3 is 4 * 1.231 ≈ 4.924, which is correct. So, f(2.3) ≈ 4.924 + 2.3 - 8 ≈ 7.224 - 8 ≈ -0.776. So, it's negative.Wait, but f(2.5) was positive, so the root is between 2.3 and 2.5.Wait, that seems a bit off because f(2) is -2, f(2.3) is -0.776, f(2.5) is +0.156. So, it's crossing zero somewhere between 2.3 and 2.5.But since the question only asks for the integer k where the root is between k and k+1, which is 2 and 3, so k=2.But just to make sure, let me check f(2.4):2^2.4 is 2^(2 + 0.4) = 4 * 2^0.4. 2^0.4 is approximately e^{0.4 ln2} ≈ e^{0.277} ≈ 1.3195. So, 2^2.4 ≈ 4 * 1.3195 ≈ 5.278. Then, f(2.4) ≈ 5.278 + 2.4 - 8 ≈ 7.678 - 8 ≈ -0.322. Still negative.f(2.45):2^2.45 = 2^(2 + 0.45) = 4 * 2^0.45. 2^0.45 ≈ e^{0.45 * 0.693} ≈ e^{0.31185} ≈ 1.365. So, 2^2.45 ≈ 4 * 1.365 ≈ 5.46. Then, f(2.45) ≈ 5.46 + 2.45 - 8 ≈ 7.91 - 8 ≈ -0.09. Still negative.f(2.475):2^2.475 = 2^(2 + 0.475) = 4 * 2^0.475. 2^0.475 ≈ e^{0.475 * 0.693} ≈ e^{0.330} ≈ 1.390. So, 2^2.475 ≈ 4 * 1.390 ≈ 5.56. Then, f(2.475) ≈ 5.56 + 2.475 - 8 ≈ 8.035 - 8 ≈ 0.035. Positive.So, f(2.475) is positive. So, the root is between 2.45 and 2.475.But again, since the question is only asking for the integer k, which is 2, because the root is between 2 and 3.Just to recap, since f(2) is negative and f(3) is positive, the root is in (2,3). Therefore, k=2.I think that's solid. I checked multiple points, saw the function crosses from negative to positive between 2 and 3, and even approximated the root to be around 2.475, but that's beyond what's needed. The question just wants the integer k, which is 2.**Final Answer**The integer ( k ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Box A contains black balls and box B contains white balls. Take a certain number of balls from A and place them in B. Then take the same number of balls from B and place them in A. Is the number of white balls in A then greater, equal to, or less than the number of black balls in B?","answer":"First, I'll define the initial setup. Box A contains only black balls, and Box B contains only white balls. Let’s denote the number of black balls in Box A as ( B_A ) and the number of white balls in Box B as ( W_B ).Next, I'll consider the process of transferring balls. A certain number of balls, say ( n ), are taken from Box A and moved to Box B. After this transfer, Box A has ( B_A - n ) black balls, and Box B has ( W_B + n ) balls in total, with all ( n ) being black.Then, the same number of balls ( n ) are transferred back from Box B to Box A. At this point, Box B contains both white and black balls. The probability of transferring a white ball back to Box A is ( frac{W_B}{W_B + n} ), and the probability of transferring a black ball back is ( frac{n}{W_B + n} ).After the transfer, the number of white balls in Box A will be ( frac{W_B cdot n}{W_B + n} ), and the number of black balls remaining in Box B will also be ( frac{n^2}{W_B + n} ).Finally, comparing these two quantities, it becomes clear that the number of white balls in Box A is equal to the number of black balls in Box B after the transfers."},{"question":"A pyramid with volume 40 cubic inches has a rectangular base. If the length of the base is doubled, the width tripled and the height increased by 50%, what is the volume of the new pyramid, in cubic inches?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a pyramid's volume. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the original pyramid has a volume of 40 cubic inches, and it has a rectangular base. Then, they change the dimensions: the length is doubled, the width is tripled, and the height is increased by 50%. I need to find the new volume. Alright, first, I remember that the volume of a pyramid is given by the formula:[ text{Volume} = frac{1}{3} times text{length} times text{width} times text{height} ]So, if I denote the original length as ( l ), the original width as ( w ), and the original height as ( h ), then the original volume is:[ frac{1}{3} times l times w times h = 40 text{ cubic inches} ]Now, the problem says the length is doubled, so the new length is ( 2l ). The width is tripled, so the new width is ( 3w ). The height is increased by 50%, which means it becomes ( h + 0.5h = 1.5h ).So, the new volume should be:[ frac{1}{3} times (2l) times (3w) times (1.5h) ]Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply the constants together:- 2 (from the length)- 3 (from the width)- 1.5 (from the height)So, 2 * 3 = 6, and 6 * 1.5 = 9. So, the constants multiply to 9.Then, the variables are ( l times w times h ), which is the same as the original volume's base. So, the new volume is:[ frac{1}{3} times 9 times l times w times h ]Which simplifies to:[ 9 times left( frac{1}{3} times l times w times h right) ]But wait, ( frac{1}{3} times l times w times h ) is the original volume, which is 40 cubic inches. So, substituting that in:[ 9 times 40 = 360 ]So, the new volume should be 360 cubic inches.Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The scaling factors are 2, 3, and 1.5 for length, width, and height respectively. Multiplying those together: 2 * 3 = 6, 6 * 1.5 = 9. So, the volume scales by a factor of 9. The original volume is 40, so 40 * 9 = 360. Yep, that seems right.I don't think I missed anything here. The formula for the volume of a pyramid is correct, and scaling each dimension affects the volume multiplicatively. So, each scaling factor is applied to the respective dimension, and since volume is a three-dimensional measurement, the total scaling factor is the product of each individual scaling factor. Just to recap:- Original Volume: ( V = frac{1}{3} l w h = 40 )- New Volume: ( V' = frac{1}{3} (2l)(3w)(1.5h) = frac{1}{3} l w h times 2 times 3 times 1.5 = V times 9 = 40 times 9 = 360 )Yep, that all adds up. I think 360 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The volume of the new pyramid is boxed{360} cubic inches."},{"question":"Given tan(alpha + beta + frac{pi}{6}) = frac{1}{2} and tan(beta - frac{pi}{6}) = -frac{1}{3}, find the value of tan(alpha + frac{pi}{3}).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of tan(alpha + frac{pi}{3}). They give me two equations: tan(alpha + beta + frac{pi}{6}) = frac{1}{2} and tan(beta - frac{pi}{6}) = -frac{1}{3}. Hmm, okay. I think I can use some tangent addition formulas here. Let me recall the formula for the tangent of a sum of two angles: tan(A + B) = frac{tan A + tan B}{1 - tan A tan B}. Maybe I can set up some equations using this.First, let me denote A = alpha + beta + frac{pi}{6} and B = beta - frac{pi}{6}. They give me tan A = frac{1}{2} and tan B = -frac{1}{3}. I need to find tan(alpha + frac{pi}{3}). Let me see if I can express alpha + frac{pi}{3} in terms of A and B.Looking at the definitions of A and B:A = alpha + beta + frac{pi}{6}B = beta - frac{pi}{6}If I subtract B from A, I get:A - B = (alpha + beta + frac{pi}{6}) - (beta - frac{pi}{6}) = alpha + frac{pi}{6} + frac{pi}{6} = alpha + frac{pi}{3}Oh, that's exactly what I need! So, tan(alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = tan(A - B). Great, so I can use the tangent subtraction formula here. The formula for tan(A - B) is frac{tan A - tan B}{1 + tan A tan B}. Let me plug in the values I have.Given that tan A = frac{1}{2} and tan B = -frac{1}{3}, so:tan(A - B) = frac{frac{1}{2} - (-frac{1}{3})}{1 + frac{1}{2} times (-frac{1}{3})}Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.Numerator: frac{1}{2} - (-frac{1}{3}) = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3}. To add these, I need a common denominator, which is 6. So, frac{3}{6} + frac{2}{6} = frac{5}{6}.Denominator: 1 + frac{1}{2} times (-frac{1}{3}) = 1 - frac{1}{6} = frac{5}{6}.So, putting it together: tan(A - B) = frac{frac{5}{6}}{frac{5}{6}} = 1.Wait, that's interesting. So, tan(alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = 1. Hmm, but I should make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.Let me double-check:1. I set A = alpha + beta + frac{pi}{6} and B = beta - frac{pi}{6}.2. Then, A - B = alpha + frac{pi}{3}, which is correct.3. Using the tangent subtraction formula: tan(A - B) = frac{tan A - tan B}{1 + tan A tan B}.4. Plugging in the values: frac{frac{1}{2} - (-frac{1}{3})}{1 + frac{1}{2} times (-frac{1}{3})}.5. Numerator: frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} = frac{5}{6}.6. Denominator: 1 - frac{1}{6} = frac{5}{6}.7. So, frac{frac{5}{6}}{frac{5}{6}} = 1.Everything seems to check out. So, the value of tan(alpha + frac{pi}{3}) is 1. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by solving for alpha and beta individually. Maybe that can confirm my answer.Let me denote:Equation 1: tan(alpha + beta + frac{pi}{6}) = frac{1}{2}Equation 2: tan(beta - frac{pi}{6}) = -frac{1}{3}Let me let C = beta - frac{pi}{6}, so Equation 2 becomes tan C = -frac{1}{3}. Then, beta = C + frac{pi}{6}.Substitute beta into Equation 1:tan(alpha + (C + frac{pi}{6}) + frac{pi}{6}) = tan(alpha + C + frac{pi}{3}) = frac{1}{2}So, tan(alpha + C + frac{pi}{3}) = frac{1}{2}But I know that tan C = -frac{1}{3}, so maybe I can use the tangent addition formula again.Let me denote D = alpha + frac{pi}{3}, so the equation becomes tan(D + C) = frac{1}{2}.Using the tangent addition formula:tan(D + C) = frac{tan D + tan C}{1 - tan D tan C} = frac{1}{2}We know tan C = -frac{1}{3}, so plug that in:frac{tan D - frac{1}{3}}{1 - tan D times (-frac{1}{3})} = frac{1}{2}Simplify the denominator: 1 + frac{1}{3} tan DSo, the equation becomes:frac{tan D - frac{1}{3}}{1 + frac{1}{3} tan D} = frac{1}{2}Let me set x = tan D for simplicity. Then:frac{x - frac{1}{3}}{1 + frac{1}{3}x} = frac{1}{2}Cross-multiplying:2(x - frac{1}{3}) = 1 + frac{1}{3}xMultiply out the left side:2x - frac{2}{3} = 1 + frac{1}{3}xBring all terms to one side:2x - frac{2}{3} - 1 - frac{1}{3}x = 0Combine like terms:(2x - frac{1}{3}x) + (-frac{2}{3} - 1) = 0Which is:frac{5}{3}x - frac{5}{3} = 0Factor out frac{5}{3}:frac{5}{3}(x - 1) = 0So, x = 1But x = tan D = tan(alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = 1So, this confirms my earlier result. Therefore, tan(alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = 1.Just to make sure, let me think if there's another perspective. Maybe using the sum and difference formulas differently or considering specific angle values.Alternatively, I could express both given equations in terms of sine and cosine, but that might complicate things more. The method I used seems straightforward and gives a consistent answer, so I think it's correct.Another check: if tan(alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = 1, then alpha + frac{pi}{3} = frac{pi}{4} + kpi for some integer k. So, alpha = frac{pi}{4} - frac{pi}{3} + kpi = -frac{pi}{12} + kpi. But without more information, we can't determine the exact value of alpha, but since the question only asks for the tangent, which is 1 regardless of the specific angle, this makes sense.So, yeah, I think I'm confident that the answer is 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"Find all positive integers ( n ) such that ( 3^n + 5^n ) is a multiple of ( 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1} ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: Find all positive integers ( n ) such that ( 3^n + 5^n ) is a multiple of ( 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1} ). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. I need to find all positive integers ( n ) where ( 3^n + 5^n ) is divisible by ( 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1} ). In other words, ( 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1} ) should divide ( 3^n + 5^n ) without leaving a remainder.Maybe I can express ( 3^n + 5^n ) in terms of ( 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1} ) to see if there's a relationship. Let me write down both expressions:( 3^n + 5^n ) and ( 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1} ).I notice that ( 3^n = 3 times 3^{n-1} ) and ( 5^n = 5 times 5^{n-1} ). So, substituting these into the first expression, I get:( 3^n + 5^n = 3 times 3^{n-1} + 5 times 5^{n-1} ).So, ( 3^n + 5^n = 3 times 3^{n-1} + 5 times 5^{n-1} ).Now, let me denote ( a = 3^{n-1} ) and ( b = 5^{n-1} ). Then, the expression becomes:( 3a + 5b ).And the divisor is ( a + b ). So, the problem reduces to finding ( n ) such that ( a + b ) divides ( 3a + 5b ).Let me write that as:( (a + b) ) divides ( 3a + 5b ).Which means that ( 3a + 5b ) is a multiple of ( a + b ). So, there exists some integer ( k ) such that:( 3a + 5b = k(a + b) ).Let me rearrange this equation:( 3a + 5b = ka + kb ).Bring all terms to one side:( 3a + 5b - ka - kb = 0 ).Factor terms:( (3 - k)a + (5 - k)b = 0 ).Hmm, so ( (3 - k)a + (5 - k)b = 0 ).Since ( a = 3^{n-1} ) and ( b = 5^{n-1} ), both ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers, and they are powers of different primes, so they are coprime. That is, ( gcd(a, b) = 1 ).Given that ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime, the equation ( (3 - k)a + (5 - k)b = 0 ) implies that both coefficients must be zero or that the coefficients are proportional in some way. But since ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime, the only way this equation holds is if both coefficients are zero or if the coefficients are proportional with a common factor. But since ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime, the coefficients must be zero.Wait, let me think again. If ( (3 - k)a + (5 - k)b = 0 ), then ( (3 - k)a = -(5 - k)b ). Since ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime, ( a ) must divide ( -(5 - k) ) and ( b ) must divide ( (3 - k) ). But since ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, the negative sign can be incorporated into ( k ).Alternatively, perhaps I can express ( k ) in terms of ( a ) and ( b ). Let me solve for ( k ):From ( 3a + 5b = k(a + b) ), we can write:( k = frac{3a + 5b}{a + b} ).Simplify this fraction:( k = frac{3a + 5b}{a + b} = frac{3a + 3b + 2b}{a + b} = 3 + frac{2b}{a + b} ).So, ( k = 3 + frac{2b}{a + b} ).Since ( k ) must be an integer, ( frac{2b}{a + b} ) must also be an integer. Let me denote ( d = gcd(a, b) ). But as I noted earlier, ( a = 3^{n-1} ) and ( b = 5^{n-1} ), so ( gcd(a, b) = 1 ) because 3 and 5 are coprime. Therefore, ( a + b ) divides ( 2b ).So, ( a + b ) divides ( 2b ). Since ( gcd(a + b, b) = gcd(a, b) = 1 ), because ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime, the only way ( a + b ) divides ( 2b ) is if ( a + b ) divides 2.Wait, let me verify that. If ( a + b ) divides ( 2b ) and ( gcd(a + b, b) = 1 ), then ( a + b ) must divide 2. Because in general, if ( m ) divides ( kn ) and ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ), then ( m ) divides ( k ). So here, ( m = a + b ), ( k = 2 ), ( n = b ). Therefore, ( a + b ) divides 2.So, ( a + b ) is a positive integer that divides 2. The positive divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. Therefore, ( a + b ) must be either 1 or 2.But ( a = 3^{n-1} ) and ( b = 5^{n-1} ), both of which are at least 1 when ( n geq 1 ). So, ( a + b geq 1 + 1 = 2 ). Therefore, ( a + b ) can only be 2.So, ( a + b = 2 ).Which means:( 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1} = 2 ).Now, let's solve this equation for positive integers ( n ).Case 1: ( n = 1 ).Then, ( 3^{0} + 5^{0} = 1 + 1 = 2 ). So, this works.Case 2: ( n = 2 ).( 3^{1} + 5^{1} = 3 + 5 = 8 ), which is not equal to 2.Case 3: ( n = 3 ).( 3^{2} + 5^{2} = 9 + 25 = 34 ), not 2.Similarly, for ( n > 1 ), ( 3^{n-1} ) and ( 5^{n-1} ) grow exponentially, so their sum will be much larger than 2. Therefore, the only solution is ( n = 1 ).Wait, but let me double-check for ( n = 1 ). The original condition is that ( 3^1 + 5^1 = 8 ) is a multiple of ( 3^{0} + 5^{0} = 2 ). Indeed, 8 is divisible by 2, so that works.Is there any other ( n ) where ( 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1} = 2 )? For ( n = 1 ), yes. For ( n = 0 ), but ( n ) is a positive integer, so ( n = 0 ) is not considered.Therefore, the only positive integer ( n ) that satisfies the condition is ( n = 1 ).But wait, let me think again. Maybe I missed something. When I set ( a + b ) divides 2, I concluded ( a + b = 2 ). But is there a possibility that ( a + b ) could be a divisor of 2 other than 1 or 2? No, because 2 is prime, so its only positive divisors are 1 and 2. But ( a + b geq 2 ), so only 2 is possible.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Let me consider the ratio ( frac{3^n + 5^n}{3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1}} ) and see when it's an integer.Express this ratio as:( frac{3^n + 5^n}{3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1}} = frac{3 cdot 3^{n-1} + 5 cdot 5^{n-1}}{3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1}} ).Let me denote ( x = 3^{n-1} ) and ( y = 5^{n-1} ). Then, the ratio becomes:( frac{3x + 5y}{x + y} ).I can write this as:( frac{3x + 3y + 2y}{x + y} = 3 + frac{2y}{x + y} ).So, the ratio is ( 3 + frac{2y}{x + y} ). For this to be an integer, ( frac{2y}{x + y} ) must be an integer.Let me denote ( d = gcd(x, y) ). Since ( x = 3^{n-1} ) and ( y = 5^{n-1} ), ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ) because 3 and 5 are coprime. Therefore, ( x ) and ( y ) are coprime.So, ( frac{2y}{x + y} ) must be an integer. Let me write ( x + y = k ), then ( frac{2y}{k} ) must be an integer. Since ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ), ( gcd(x + y, y) = gcd(x, y) = 1 ). Therefore, ( x + y ) must divide 2.So, ( x + y ) divides 2, which means ( x + y ) is either 1 or 2. But ( x = 3^{n-1} ) and ( y = 5^{n-1} ), both are at least 1, so ( x + y geq 2 ). Therefore, ( x + y = 2 ).Thus, ( 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1} = 2 ). As before, this only happens when ( n = 1 ), since ( 3^{0} + 5^{0} = 1 + 1 = 2 ).Therefore, the only solution is ( n = 1 ).Wait, but let me check for ( n = 2 ) just to be thorough. For ( n = 2 ), ( 3^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 25 = 34 ), and ( 3^{1} + 5^{1} = 3 + 5 = 8 ). Is 34 divisible by 8? 8 times 4 is 32, which is less than 34, and 8 times 5 is 40, which is more than 34. So, no, 34 is not divisible by 8. Therefore, ( n = 2 ) doesn't work.Similarly, for ( n = 3 ), ( 3^3 + 5^3 = 27 + 125 = 152 ), and ( 3^{2} + 5^{2} = 9 + 25 = 34 ). Is 152 divisible by 34? 34 times 4 is 136, 34 times 5 is 170, so no, 152 is not divisible by 34.For ( n = 4 ), ( 3^4 + 5^4 = 81 + 625 = 706 ), and ( 3^3 + 5^3 = 27 + 125 = 152 ). Is 706 divisible by 152? 152 times 4 is 608, 152 times 5 is 760, so no.It seems that as ( n ) increases, the ratio ( frac{3^n + 5^n}{3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1}} ) approaches 5, because ( 5^n ) grows much faster than ( 3^n ). So, for large ( n ), the ratio is approximately ( frac{5^n}{5^{n-1}} = 5 ). But since we're dealing with integers, it might not exactly reach 5, but it will get closer to 5 as ( n ) increases.But in our case, we need the ratio to be an integer. So, for ( n = 1 ), the ratio is 4 (since ( 8 / 2 = 4 )). For ( n = 2 ), it's 34 / 8 = 4.25, which is not an integer. For ( n = 3 ), it's 152 / 34 ≈ 4.47, not an integer. For ( n = 4 ), it's 706 / 152 ≈ 4.64, still not an integer. For ( n = 5 ), ( 3^5 + 5^5 = 243 + 3125 = 3368 ), and ( 3^4 + 5^4 = 81 + 625 = 706 ). 3368 / 706 ≈ 4.77, not an integer.It seems that as ( n ) increases, the ratio approaches 5 but never actually becomes an integer again. Therefore, the only solution is ( n = 1 ).Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a way to express the ratio differently. Let me write the ratio as:( frac{3^n + 5^n}{3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1}} = frac{3 cdot 3^{n-1} + 5 cdot 5^{n-1}}{3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1}} = frac{3a + 5b}{a + b} ), where ( a = 3^{n-1} ) and ( b = 5^{n-1} ).Let me denote ( r = frac{b}{a} = left(frac{5}{3}right)^{n-1} ). Then, the ratio becomes:( frac{3a + 5b}{a + b} = frac{3 + 5r}{1 + r} ).So, ( frac{3 + 5r}{1 + r} ) must be an integer. Let me denote this integer as ( k ). So,( frac{3 + 5r}{1 + r} = k ).Multiply both sides by ( 1 + r ):( 3 + 5r = k(1 + r) ).Rearrange:( 3 + 5r = k + kr ).Bring all terms to one side:( 5r - kr + 3 - k = 0 ).Factor ( r ):( r(5 - k) + (3 - k) = 0 ).So,( r = frac{k - 3}{5 - k} ).But ( r = left(frac{5}{3}right)^{n-1} ), which is a positive real number greater than 1 for ( n > 1 ), since ( 5/3 > 1 ).So, ( r = frac{k - 3}{5 - k} ) must be positive. Therefore, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.Case 1: Both numerator and denominator are positive.So,( k - 3 > 0 ) and ( 5 - k > 0 ).Which implies:( k > 3 ) and ( k < 5 ).Since ( k ) is an integer, possible values are ( k = 4 ).Case 2: Both numerator and denominator are negative.So,( k - 3 < 0 ) and ( 5 - k < 0 ).Which implies:( k < 3 ) and ( k > 5 ).But this is impossible because ( k ) cannot be both less than 3 and greater than 5 at the same time.Therefore, the only possible value is ( k = 4 ).So, substituting ( k = 4 ) into the equation:( r = frac{4 - 3}{5 - 4} = frac{1}{1} = 1 ).But ( r = left(frac{5}{3}right)^{n-1} = 1 ).This implies that ( left(frac{5}{3}right)^{n-1} = 1 ).Taking logarithms on both sides:( (n - 1) lnleft(frac{5}{3}right) = 0 ).Since ( lnleft(frac{5}{3}right) neq 0 ), we must have ( n - 1 = 0 ), so ( n = 1 ).Therefore, the only solution is ( n = 1 ).This confirms my earlier conclusion. So, the only positive integer ( n ) that satisfies the condition is ( n = 1 ).Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me test ( n = 1 ) again:( 3^1 + 5^1 = 3 + 5 = 8 ).( 3^{0} + 5^{0} = 1 + 1 = 2 ).8 divided by 2 is 4, which is an integer. So, it works.For ( n = 2 ):( 3^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 25 = 34 ).( 3^{1} + 5^{1} = 3 + 5 = 8 ).34 divided by 8 is 4.25, not an integer.For ( n = 3 ):( 3^3 + 5^3 = 27 + 125 = 152 ).( 3^{2} + 5^{2} = 9 + 25 = 34 ).152 divided by 34 is approximately 4.47, not an integer.For ( n = 4 ):( 3^4 + 5^4 = 81 + 625 = 706 ).( 3^{3} + 5^{3} = 27 + 125 = 152 ).706 divided by 152 is approximately 4.64, not an integer.As ( n ) increases, the ratio approaches 5 but never becomes an integer again because ( 5^n ) grows much faster than ( 3^n ), making the ratio approach 5 from below, but never actually reaching it for integer ( n > 1 ).Therefore, I'm confident that the only solution is ( n = 1 )."},{"question":"In a deck of 52 French playing cards, there are four suits, each with 13 cards of different values. Which of the following is more likely: a) That out of 13 dealt cards, 10 are of a specified suit,b) That out of the 13 dealt cards, all represent different values?","answer":"Okay, so I have this probability question here about a standard deck of 52 French playing cards. It asks which is more likely: a) Getting 10 cards of a specified suit out of 13 dealt cards, or b) Having all 13 dealt cards represent different values.Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which of these two events is more probable. Let me break it down step by step.First, let me recall that a standard deck has 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards, each with a unique value: numbers 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. So, 13 values in total.For part a), we're dealing with the probability that out of 13 cards dealt, 10 are of a specified suit. Let's say, for example, we're looking at hearts. So, we want 10 hearts and 3 non-hearts in our 13-card hand.For part b), we want all 13 cards to have different values. That means, for each value (like 2, 3, ..., 10, J, Q, K, A), we have exactly one card in our hand. Since there are 13 values and we have 13 cards, each value must appear exactly once. But since there are four suits, each value can be represented by any of the four suits. So, for each value, we can have any of the four suits, but we can't have more than one card of the same value.Alright, so to compare these two probabilities, I need to calculate both and see which one is larger.Starting with part a), the probability of having 10 cards of a specified suit in a 13-card hand.This is a hypergeometric probability problem because we're dealing with successes (hearts) and failures (non-hearts) without replacement.The formula for hypergeometric probability is:P = (C(K, k) * C(N-K, n-k)) / C(N, n)Where:- N is the total population size (52 cards)- K is the number of success states in the population (13 hearts)- n is the number of draws (13 cards)- k is the number of observed successes (10 hearts)So plugging in the numbers:C(13, 10) * C(52-13, 13-10) / C(52, 13)Simplify that:C(13, 10) * C(39, 3) / C(52, 13)I can compute these combinations, but maybe I can simplify it first.C(13, 10) is the same as C(13, 3) because C(n, k) = C(n, n-k). So, C(13, 3) = 286.C(39, 3) is the number of ways to choose 3 non-hearts from 39 non-hearts. Let me compute that:C(39, 3) = 39! / (3! * (39-3)!) = (39*38*37)/(3*2*1) = (39*38*37)/6Calculating that:39 divided by 3 is 13, so 13*38*37 / 213*38 = 494, then 494*37 = let's see, 494*30=14,820 and 494*7=3,458, so total is 14,820 + 3,458 = 18,278. Then divide by 2: 9,139.Wait, hold on, let me double-check that:39*38 = 1,4821,482*37: Let's compute 1,482*30 = 44,460 and 1,482*7 = 10,374. Adding them together: 44,460 + 10,374 = 54,834.Then divide by 6: 54,834 / 6 = 9,139. Yes, that's correct.So, C(39, 3) = 9,139.So, the numerator for part a) is 286 * 9,139.Let me compute that:286 * 9,139. Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe break it down:286 * 9,000 = 2,574,000286 * 139 = ?Compute 286*100 = 28,600286*30 = 8,580286*9 = 2,574Add them up: 28,600 + 8,580 = 37,180; 37,180 + 2,574 = 39,754So, total numerator is 2,574,000 + 39,754 = 2,613,754.So, numerator is 2,613,754.Denominator is C(52, 13). That's a huge number. I might need to look up its approximate value or use logarithms, but maybe I can keep it as C(52,13) for now.So, P(a) = 2,613,754 / C(52,13)Now, moving on to part b), the probability that all 13 cards have different values.This is equivalent to having one card of each value, but each can be any suit. So, it's like choosing one card for each of the 13 values, and since there are 4 suits, each value has 4 choices.So, the total number of favorable hands is 4^13, because for each of the 13 values, you can choose any of the 4 suits.But wait, actually, the number of ways to choose 13 cards with all different values is C(52,13) multiplied by the probability that all values are unique. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.Alternatively, the number of ways to have all different values is equal to the number of ways to choose one card for each value. Since there are 13 values, and for each value, 4 choices (suits), the total number is 4^13.But wait, no. Because when you choose 13 cards, each with a unique value, you're essentially selecting one card from each of the 13 value groups. Since each value has 4 cards (one per suit), the number of ways is 4^13.But actually, in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose one card from each of the 13 value groups is indeed 4^13. However, since we are dealing with combinations, not permutations, we have to consider that the order doesn't matter. Wait, no, actually, in this case, since we're dealing with sets of cards, the order doesn't matter, but each selection is unique.Wait, maybe another approach: The total number of possible 13-card hands is C(52,13). The number of favorable hands is the number of ways to choose one card from each of the 13 values, which is 4^13. So, the probability is 4^13 / C(52,13).But wait, hold on, is that correct? Because 4^13 counts the number of ways to choose one suit for each value, but in reality, when you choose a hand, the order doesn't matter. So actually, 4^13 is the number of possible such hands, each corresponding to a unique combination of suits for each value.Yes, so the number of favorable hands is 4^13, and the total number of possible hands is C(52,13). So, the probability is 4^13 / C(52,13).So, P(b) = 4^13 / C(52,13)Now, let's compute 4^13. 4^10 is 1,048,576, so 4^13 is 4^10 * 4^3 = 1,048,576 * 64 = let's compute that.1,048,576 * 60 = 62,914,5601,048,576 * 4 = 4,194,304Adding them together: 62,914,560 + 4,194,304 = 67,108,864.So, 4^13 = 67,108,864.So, P(b) = 67,108,864 / C(52,13)Now, let's compare P(a) and P(b). Both have the same denominator, C(52,13), so we can compare their numerators.P(a) numerator: 2,613,754P(b) numerator: 67,108,864So, 67 million is way larger than 2.6 million. Therefore, P(b) is much larger than P(a). So, the probability of having all 13 cards with different values is much higher than having 10 cards of a specified suit in a 13-card hand.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the numerator for part a). Let me double-check.For part a), we have C(13,10) * C(39,3). C(13,10) is 286, and C(39,3) is 9,139. Multiplying them gives 286 * 9,139.Let me compute 286 * 9,139 again:First, 200 * 9,139 = 1,827,800Then, 80 * 9,139 = 731,120Then, 6 * 9,139 = 54,834Adding them up: 1,827,800 + 731,120 = 2,558,920; 2,558,920 + 54,834 = 2,613,754.Yes, that's correct. So, 2,613,754 is indeed the numerator for part a).And for part b), we have 4^13 = 67,108,864.So, 67 million divided by C(52,13) is a much larger probability than 2.6 million divided by the same denominator.Therefore, event b) is more likely than event a).But just to get a sense of the magnitude, let's compute approximate values.C(52,13) is approximately 6.35 x 10^11 (I remember that C(52,13) is about 635 billion). Let me confirm:C(52,13) = 52! / (13! * 39!) ≈ 6.35 x 10^11.So, P(a) ≈ 2,613,754 / 6.35 x 10^11 ≈ 4.11 x 10^-9, which is about 0.000000411.P(b) ≈ 67,108,864 / 6.35 x 10^11 ≈ 1.056 x 10^-4, which is about 0.0001056.So, P(b) is roughly 0.0001056, which is about 257 times larger than P(a)'s 0.000000411.So, yes, event b) is significantly more likely.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that getting all different values is a much less restrictive condition than getting 10 of a specific suit. Since there are many more ways to have all different values (each card can be any suit, as long as the values are unique), whereas getting 10 of a specific suit is a much more restrictive condition, requiring 10 specific cards and only 3 non-specific.Therefore, the probability of event b) is much higher.**Final Answer**The more likely event is boxed{b}."},{"question":"If left(1-2xright)^{5}=a_{0}+a_{1}x+ldots +a_{5}x^{5}, a_{i}in R, i=0, 1, ldots , 5, then a_{2}+a_{4}=______. (Provide the answer as a number)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If (1 - 2x)^5 is expanded into a polynomial a0 + a1x + a2x² + ... + a5x⁵, then I need to find the sum of a2 and a4. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that when you expand a binomial like (a + b)^n, you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that (a + b)^n = Σ (from k=0 to n) [C(n, k) * a^(n - k) * b^k], where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. So in this case, our binomial is (1 - 2x)^5, so a is 1, b is -2x, and n is 5.So, applying the binomial theorem, the expansion of (1 - 2x)^5 will be the sum from k=0 to 5 of C(5, k) * (1)^(5 - k) * (-2x)^k. Simplifying that, since 1 raised to any power is just 1, each term becomes C(5, k) * (-2x)^k.Therefore, each coefficient ai is C(5, i) * (-2)^i. So, to find a2 and a4, I can compute C(5, 2)*(-2)^2 and C(5, 4)*(-2)^4, then add them together.Let me compute each term separately.First, a2: C(5, 2) is the number of combinations of 5 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (5*4*3!)/(2*1*3!) = (5*4)/2 = 10. So, C(5, 2) is 10.Then, (-2)^2 is 4. So, a2 = 10 * 4 = 40.Next, a4: Similarly, C(5, 4) is the number of combinations of 5 things taken 4 at a time. Using the same formula, C(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * 1!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/(4*3*2*1 * 1) = 5. So, C(5, 4) is 5.Then, (-2)^4 is 16. So, a4 = 5 * 16 = 80.Therefore, a2 + a4 = 40 + 80 = 120.Wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because 120 seems a bit high.Wait, let me recalculate a2 and a4.For a2: C(5, 2) is 10, and (-2)^2 is 4, so 10*4 is indeed 40. That seems right.For a4: C(5, 4) is 5, and (-2)^4 is 16, so 5*16 is 80. That also seems correct.Adding them together: 40 + 80 = 120. Hmm, okay, that seems consistent.But just to be thorough, maybe I can expand the entire polynomial and check the coefficients.Let's try expanding (1 - 2x)^5 step by step.First, (1 - 2x)^1 = 1 - 2x.(1 - 2x)^2 = (1 - 2x)(1 - 2x) = 1 - 4x + 4x².(1 - 2x)^3 = (1 - 4x + 4x²)(1 - 2x) = 1*(1 - 2x) - 4x*(1 - 2x) + 4x²*(1 - 2x) = 1 - 2x - 4x + 8x² + 4x² - 8x³ = 1 - 6x + 12x² - 8x³.(1 - 2x)^4 = (1 - 6x + 12x² - 8x³)(1 - 2x) = 1*(1 - 2x) - 6x*(1 - 2x) + 12x²*(1 - 2x) - 8x³*(1 - 2x) = 1 - 2x - 6x + 12x² + 12x² - 24x³ - 8x³ + 16x⁴ = 1 - 8x + 24x² - 32x³ + 16x⁴.(1 - 2x)^5 = (1 - 8x + 24x² - 32x³ + 16x⁴)(1 - 2x) = 1*(1 - 2x) - 8x*(1 - 2x) + 24x²*(1 - 2x) - 32x³*(1 - 2x) + 16x⁴*(1 - 2x) = 1 - 2x - 8x + 16x² + 24x² - 48x³ - 32x³ + 64x⁴ + 16x⁴ - 32x⁵.Now, let's combine like terms:Constant term: 1.x term: -2x -8x = -10x.x² term: 16x² +24x² = 40x².x³ term: -48x³ -32x³ = -80x³.x⁴ term: 64x⁴ +16x⁴ = 80x⁴.x⁵ term: -32x⁵.So, putting it all together, (1 - 2x)^5 = 1 -10x +40x² -80x³ +80x⁴ -32x⁵.Therefore, the coefficients are:a0 = 1,a1 = -10,a2 = 40,a3 = -80,a4 = 80,a5 = -32.So, a2 is 40, a4 is 80, so a2 + a4 = 40 + 80 = 120.Wait, that's the same result as before. So, seems like 120 is correct.But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps using the binomial coefficients and powers.Alternatively, I can use the fact that the sum of coefficients can be found by plugging in x=1 and x=-1, but since we only need a2 and a4, maybe that's not directly helpful.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum a2 + a4 by considering specific values.Wait, another approach: the sum a2 + a4 is the sum of the coefficients of x² and x⁴ in the expansion. So, perhaps I can compute this sum by evaluating the expansion at specific roots of unity or something, but that might be more complicated.Alternatively, since the polynomial is (1 - 2x)^5, maybe I can think of it as a generating function and find the sum of coefficients at even powers. But in this case, we only need a2 and a4, not all even coefficients.Alternatively, I can note that a2 + a4 is equal to (f(1) + f(-1))/2 - (a0 + a1 + a3 + a5)/2, but I don't know if that's helpful.Wait, let me think. If I plug in x=1, I get f(1) = (1 - 2*1)^5 = (-1)^5 = -1. Similarly, f(-1) = (1 - 2*(-1))^5 = (1 + 2)^5 = 3^5 = 243.Then, f(1) + f(-1) = (-1) + 243 = 242. But f(1) + f(-1) is equal to 2*(a0 + a2 + a4), because when you plug in x=1, you get a0 + a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5, and when you plug in x=-1, you get a0 - a1 + a2 - a3 + a4 - a5. Adding them together, the odd terms cancel out, and you get 2*(a0 + a2 + a4). So, 2*(a0 + a2 + a4) = 242, so a0 + a2 + a4 = 121.But we already know a0 is 1, so 1 + a2 + a4 = 121, so a2 + a4 = 120. That's another way to get the same result. So, that confirms it.Alternatively, if I subtract f(1) - f(-1), I get 2*(a1 + a3 + a5). So, f(1) - f(-1) = (-1) - 243 = -244, so 2*(a1 + a3 + a5) = -244, so a1 + a3 + a5 = -122. But since we already know a1 is -10, a3 is -80, a5 is -32, adding them up: -10 -80 -32 = -122. That also checks out.So, all these methods seem to confirm that a2 + a4 = 120.Alternatively, I can think of the expansion using the binomial coefficients and just compute each term.Wait, another thought: since we're dealing with (1 - 2x)^5, the coefficients alternate in sign because of the negative sign in front of 2x. So, the coefficients for even powers (a0, a2, a4) will be positive, and the coefficients for odd powers (a1, a3, a5) will be negative. That's consistent with the expansion we did earlier.So, a0 is positive, a2 is positive, a4 is positive, which is why their sum is positive 120.Alternatively, if I think about the expansion, the coefficients can be found using the formula:a_k = C(5, k) * (-2)^k.So, for k=2: C(5,2)*(-2)^2 = 10*4=40,For k=4: C(5,4)*(-2)^4=5*16=80,So, adding them gives 40 + 80=120.Therefore, regardless of the method I use, I keep getting 120 as the sum of a2 and a4.I think that's solid. So, I can confidently say that a2 + a4 is 120.**Final Answer**The value of (a_2 + a_4) is boxed{120}."},{"question":"Alice thinks of two real numbers and writes down their product and their sum.

Each volunteer can only go to one project, and each project must have at least one volunteer. The question is asking for the total number of different distribution schemes, and the options are A: 60, B: 120, C: 240, D: 480.Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a combinatorics problem, specifically about distributing objects into bins with certain constraints. In this case, the objects are the volunteers, and the bins are the projects. Each volunteer is distinct, and each project must have at least one volunteer. So, it's similar to assigning each volunteer to a project, but ensuring that no project is left empty.I remember that when distributing distinct objects into distinct bins with no empty bins, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or Stirling numbers of the second kind. But since the projects are distinct, we might need to multiply by the number of permutations as well.Wait, let me recall. The number of ways to distribute n distinct objects into k distinct boxes with no empty boxes is given by k! multiplied by the Stirling numbers of the second kind, S(n, k). So, in this case, n is 5 volunteers, and k is 4 projects. So, the formula would be 4! * S(5, 4).But I'm not sure if I remember the exact value of S(5,4). Maybe I can compute it. The Stirling number of the second kind, S(n, k), counts the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets. So, for S(5,4), how many ways can we partition 5 volunteers into 4 projects, each with at least one volunteer.I think S(n, k) can be calculated using the formula:S(n, k) = S(n-1, k-1) + k * S(n-1, k)But I don't remember the exact values. Alternatively, I can think about it as the number of ways to assign each volunteer to a project, subtracting the cases where one or more projects are empty.Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of ways to assign 5 volunteers to 4 projects without any restrictions is 4^5, since each volunteer has 4 choices. But this includes cases where some projects might have no volunteers. So, we need to subtract the cases where at least one project is empty.The inclusion-exclusion principle states that the number of onto functions from a set of size n to a set of size k is:k! * S(n, k) = sum_{i=0 to k} (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (k - i)^nSo, plugging in n=5 and k=4, we get:Number of ways = sum_{i=0 to 4} (-1)^i * C(4, i) * (4 - i)^5Let me compute that step by step.First, when i=0:(-1)^0 * C(4,0) * (4 - 0)^5 = 1 * 1 * 4^5 = 1024i=1:(-1)^1 * C(4,1) * (4 - 1)^5 = -1 * 4 * 3^5 = -4 * 243 = -972i=2:(-1)^2 * C(4,2) * (4 - 2)^5 = 1 * 6 * 2^5 = 6 * 32 = 192i=3:(-1)^3 * C(4,3) * (4 - 3)^5 = -1 * 4 * 1^5 = -4 * 1 = -4i=4:(-1)^4 * C(4,4) * (4 - 4)^5 = 1 * 1 * 0^5 = 0Now, adding all these up:1024 - 972 + 192 - 4 + 0Let me compute step by step:1024 - 972 = 5252 + 192 = 244244 - 4 = 240So, the total number of onto functions is 240.Therefore, the number of distribution schemes is 240, which is option C.Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because sometimes when dealing with distinguishable boxes, the formula is indeed k! * S(n, k), but in this case, since the projects are distinct, each assignment is unique, so the inclusion-exclusion gives the correct count.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since each project must have at least one volunteer, and we have 5 volunteers, one project will have 2 volunteers, and the others will have 1 each.So, first, we can choose which project gets 2 volunteers. There are C(4,1) = 4 ways to choose this project.Then, we need to choose 2 volunteers out of 5 to assign to this project. That's C(5,2) = 10 ways.Then, the remaining 3 volunteers need to be assigned to the remaining 3 projects, one each. Since the projects are distinct, this is a permutation of 3 volunteers, which is 3! = 6.So, the total number of ways is 4 * 10 * 6 = 240.Yes, that's another way to get 240, which confirms the previous result.Therefore, the answer should be 240, which is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"- A power grid with the shape of a  3times 3  lattice with  16  nodes (vertices of the lattice) joined by wires (along the sides of squares. It may have happened that some of the wires have burned out. In one test technician can choose any two nodes and check if electrical current circulates between them (i.e there is a chain of intact wires joining the chosen nodes) . Technicial knows that current will circulate from any node to another node. What is the least number of tests required to demonstrate this?- Previous problem for the grid of  5times 5  lattice.","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the minimum number of tests needed to determine if a 3x3 grid (which has 16 nodes) is fully connected, meaning there's a path of intact wires between any two nodes. The technician can test any two nodes to see if current can flow between them. The goal is to find the least number of such tests required to confirm that the entire grid is connected.First, I need to understand the structure of the grid. A 3x3 grid has 3 rows and 3 columns, but since it's a lattice, it actually has 4 nodes along each side, making it a 4x4 grid of nodes, totaling 16 nodes. These nodes are connected by wires along the edges of the squares, so each node (except those on the edges) is connected to four others: up, down, left, and right.Now, the problem states that some wires might have burned out, but the technician knows that the grid is connected, meaning there's a path between any two nodes. However, the technician needs to verify this with the least number of tests. Each test involves selecting two nodes and checking if current can flow between them, which essentially checks if there's a connected path of intact wires.To approach this, I think about graph theory. The grid can be represented as a graph where nodes are vertices and wires are edges. The technician needs to confirm that this graph is connected. In graph theory, a connected graph with n nodes requires at least n-1 edges. However, in this case, the technician isn't checking edges but rather paths between nodes. So, it's more about verifying connectivity rather than counting edges.One strategy could be to perform tests that cover all the nodes in such a way that if all tests pass, the entire grid must be connected. This might involve selecting pairs of nodes that, if connected, imply that the entire graph is connected.For a 3x3 grid (16 nodes), I wonder if there's a way to select a spanning tree of the graph and test the connections along that tree. A spanning tree of a connected graph includes all the nodes with the minimum number of edges (n-1). For 16 nodes, that would be 15 edges. However, the technician isn't testing edges but paths between nodes. So, testing 15 pairs might be overkill because each test can potentially confirm multiple connections.Alternatively, maybe the technician can use a strategy similar to verifying connectivity in a graph by testing a set of pairs that form a connected subgraph. If the technician can confirm that certain key pairs are connected, it might imply that the entire grid is connected.I recall that in a grid graph, the connectivity can be verified by checking connections along rows and columns. For example, if the technician can confirm that each row is connected and each column is connected, then the entire grid is connected. However, this might require more tests than necessary.Another approach is to think about the grid as a graph and determine the minimum number of node pairs that need to be tested to ensure that the graph is connected. This might relate to the concept of a \\"vertex cover\\" or \\"dominating set,\\" but I'm not entirely sure.Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the number of connected components. Initially, without any tests, the grid could be in any state, but the technician knows it's connected. The technician needs to confirm this with the fewest tests. Each test can potentially reduce the number of possible connected components.In the worst case, each test could confirm that two nodes are connected, but to ensure the entire grid is connected, the technician needs to cover all nodes in a way that any disconnection would be detected.Perhaps the minimum number of tests required is equal to the number of nodes minus one, but that seems too high. Alternatively, it might be related to the number of edges in a spanning tree, but again, since we're testing node pairs, not edges, it's different.Wait, another idea: if the technician can test a set of node pairs that form a spanning tree, then confirming that all those pairs are connected would imply the entire grid is connected. Since a spanning tree has n-1 edges, but we're testing node pairs, which can cover multiple edges. So, maybe the number of tests needed is equal to the number of edges in a spanning tree, which is 15 for 16 nodes. But that seems too many because each test can cover multiple edges.Alternatively, perhaps the technician can use a binary search approach, where each test divides the grid into smaller sections, but I'm not sure how that would apply here.Wait, maybe the problem is similar to the problem of determining the minimum number of edges to test to confirm connectivity. In that case, for a graph with n nodes, you need at least n-1 tests, but since we're testing node pairs, which can cover multiple edges, maybe fewer tests are needed.Actually, in the case of a grid, which is a planar graph, the number of tests might be related to the number of rows and columns. For a 3x3 grid (16 nodes), there are 4 rows and 4 columns. If the technician can confirm that each row is connected and each column is connected, then the entire grid is connected. However, confirming each row would require 3 tests per row (since each row has 4 nodes, and to confirm connectivity, you need to test 3 pairs), and similarly for columns. But that would be 3*4 + 3*4 = 24 tests, which seems too many.Wait, no. Actually, to confirm that a row is connected, you don't need to test all pairs. You just need to test adjacent nodes in the row. For a row with 4 nodes, you need 3 tests to confirm that each adjacent pair is connected. Similarly for columns. So, for 4 rows, that's 3*4=12 tests, and for 4 columns, another 12 tests, totaling 24 tests. But that's still more than necessary because the technician isn't testing edges but paths.Wait, the technician isn't testing edges; they're testing paths between any two nodes. So, if the technician tests the connectivity between the first and last node in a row, that would confirm that the entire row is connected, without needing to test each adjacent pair. Similarly for columns.So, for each row, testing the connectivity between the first and last node would confirm that the entire row is connected. Since there are 4 rows, that's 4 tests. Similarly, for each column, testing the connectivity between the top and bottom node would confirm that the entire column is connected, which is another 4 tests. So, in total, 8 tests.But wait, does that ensure the entire grid is connected? If all rows are connected and all columns are connected, does that necessarily mean the entire grid is connected? I think so, because if each row is connected and each column is connected, then any node can reach any other node by moving along rows and columns.However, I'm not entirely sure. For example, suppose there's a break in one of the columns, but the rows are still connected. Wait, no, because if the columns are tested between top and bottom, and all pass, then the columns are connected. Similarly, the rows are connected. So, combining both, the entire grid should be connected.But let me think of a counterexample. Suppose the grid is divided into two separate connected components, but each row and column test passes. Is that possible? I don't think so because if each row is connected and each column is connected, then the entire grid must be connected.Wait, actually, no. Imagine a grid where the top-left to bottom-right diagonal is broken, but each row and column is still connected. Wait, no, because if a row is connected, all nodes in that row are connected, and similarly for columns. So, if all rows and columns are connected, the entire grid must be connected.Therefore, testing 8 pairs (4 rows and 4 columns) should be sufficient to confirm that the entire grid is connected.But is 8 the minimum? Maybe we can do better. For example, if we test the four corners: top-left to top-right, top-left to bottom-left, top-right to bottom-right, and bottom-left to bottom-right. That would be 4 tests. But does that ensure the entire grid is connected? I don't think so because there could be a break somewhere in the middle that isn't detected by just testing the corners.Alternatively, maybe testing the four corners and the center. But that might not be necessary.Wait, another idea: if we test a set of pairs that form a spanning tree. For a grid graph, a spanning tree would include all nodes connected in a way that there's a path from any node to any other node. The number of edges in a spanning tree is n-1, which for 16 nodes is 15. But since we're testing node pairs, each test can cover multiple edges. So, maybe the number of tests needed is equal to the number of edges in a spanning tree divided by the average number of edges each test can cover.But I'm not sure how to calculate that. Alternatively, maybe the minimum number of tests is equal to the number of nodes minus one, which is 15, but that seems too high because each test can confirm multiple connections.Wait, perhaps the problem is related to the concept of a \\"connected dominating set.\\" A dominating set is a set of nodes such that every node is either in the set or adjacent to a node in the set. If the technician can test a connected dominating set, then the entire grid is connected. But I'm not sure how that translates to the number of tests.Alternatively, maybe the problem is similar to the problem of determining the minimum number of edges to test to confirm connectivity, which is n-1. But since we're testing node pairs, which can cover multiple edges, maybe fewer tests are needed.Wait, actually, in the case of a grid, which is a planar graph, the number of tests needed might be related to the number of rows and columns. For a 3x3 grid (16 nodes), if we test the connectivity between the first and last node in each row and each column, that's 8 tests, as I thought earlier. But maybe we can do better by testing fewer pairs that cover multiple rows and columns.For example, if we test the connectivity between the top-left and bottom-right corners, that would cover both a row and a column. Similarly, testing the top-right and bottom-left corners would cover another row and column. So, with just 2 tests, we can cover both diagonals. But does that ensure the entire grid is connected? I don't think so because there could be breaks in the rows or columns that aren't covered by the diagonals.Alternatively, maybe testing the four corners and the center. That would be 5 tests. But again, I'm not sure if that's sufficient.Wait, perhaps the minimum number of tests is equal to the number of rows plus the number of columns minus 1. For a 3x3 grid, that would be 4 + 4 - 1 = 7 tests. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.Alternatively, maybe the minimum number of tests is equal to the number of rows plus the number of columns, which is 8 tests, as I thought earlier.Wait, let me think differently. Suppose the technician wants to confirm that the grid is connected. The worst-case scenario is that the grid is just barely connected, meaning it's a tree with 15 edges. To confirm that, the technician needs to ensure that there's a path between any two nodes. However, since the technician knows the grid is connected, they just need to confirm that there are no disconnections.But how can they do that with the fewest tests? Each test can potentially confirm that a large portion of the grid is connected. For example, testing the connectivity between two nodes that are far apart can confirm that a large section of the grid is connected.In a 3x3 grid, the maximum distance between two nodes is 6 edges (from one corner to the opposite corner). So, if the technician tests the connectivity between two opposite corners, that would confirm that the entire grid is connected if that test passes. But wait, no, because there could be a break somewhere else in the grid that isn't on the path between those two corners.Wait, actually, if the grid is connected, there must be a path between any two nodes, including the opposite corners. So, if the technician tests the connectivity between two opposite corners and it passes, that doesn't necessarily confirm that the entire grid is connected because there could be other disconnected components elsewhere.Wait, no, if the grid is connected, then any two nodes must be connected. So, if the technician tests a single pair and it passes, that doesn't confirm the entire grid is connected because there could be other disconnected components. For example, the grid could be split into two connected components, and the tested pair happens to be in the same component.Therefore, the technician needs to test enough pairs to ensure that all nodes are connected. One way to do this is to test pairs that form a spanning tree. For example, if the technician tests pairs that form a path from one corner to the opposite corner, covering all nodes, that would require 15 tests, which is too many.Alternatively, the technician can use a strategy where each test covers multiple nodes. For example, testing the connectivity between the first and last node in each row and each column, as I thought earlier, which is 8 tests. This would ensure that each row and column is connected, and thus the entire grid is connected.But is 8 the minimum? Maybe not. Perhaps there's a way to test fewer pairs that still cover all rows and columns.Wait, another idea: if the technician tests the connectivity between the first node of each row and the first node of the next row, that would connect all rows. Similarly, testing the connectivity between the first node of each column and the first node of the next column would connect all columns. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient.Alternatively, maybe the technician can test a set of pairs that form a connected subgraph covering all nodes. For example, testing pairs that form a snake-like pattern through the grid, which would require fewer tests.Wait, perhaps the minimum number of tests is equal to the number of rows plus the number of columns minus 1. For a 3x3 grid, that's 4 + 4 - 1 = 7 tests. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.Alternatively, maybe the minimum number of tests is equal to the number of rows plus the number of columns, which is 8 tests. This seems more plausible because testing each row and column separately would cover all possible connections.Wait, let me think of it this way: if the technician tests the connectivity between the first and last node in each row, that's 4 tests. Similarly, testing the connectivity between the first and last node in each column is another 4 tests. So, 8 tests in total. This would ensure that each row is connected and each column is connected, which in turn ensures that the entire grid is connected.But is there a way to reduce the number of tests? For example, if the technician tests the connectivity between the first node of each row and the first node of the next row, that would connect all rows. Similarly, testing the connectivity between the first node of each column and the first node of the next column would connect all columns. This would require 3 tests for rows and 3 tests for columns, totaling 6 tests. But does that ensure the entire grid is connected?Wait, if the technician tests the connectivity between the first node of row 1 and row 2, row 2 and row 3, and row 3 and row 4, that would connect all rows. Similarly, testing the connectivity between the first node of column 1 and column 2, column 2 and column 3, and column 3 and column 4 would connect all columns. So, 6 tests in total. But does this ensure that the entire grid is connected?I think it does because if all rows are connected to each other and all columns are connected to each other, then any node can reach any other node by moving through the connected rows and columns. Therefore, 6 tests might be sufficient.But wait, let me think again. If the technician tests the connectivity between the first node of each row and the first node of the next row, that connects the rows, but what about the columns? Similarly, testing the columns connects them, but does that ensure that the entire grid is connected?Yes, because if all rows are connected and all columns are connected, then the entire grid must be connected. For example, to go from any node to any other node, you can move along the rows to the desired column and then along the columns to the desired node.Therefore, the minimum number of tests required might be 6: 3 for rows and 3 for columns.But wait, in a 3x3 grid, there are 4 rows and 4 columns. So, to connect 4 rows, you need 3 tests (connecting row 1-2, 2-3, 3-4). Similarly, for columns, 3 tests (column 1-2, 2-3, 3-4). So, total of 6 tests.But let me verify this with an example. Suppose the grid is connected, and the technician performs these 6 tests. If all tests pass, then the grid is connected. If any test fails, then the grid is disconnected. Therefore, 6 tests should be sufficient.But is 6 the minimum? Could it be done with fewer tests?Suppose the technician tests 5 pairs. Is it possible that the grid is connected but the tests don't cover all necessary connections? For example, if the technician tests 2 row connections and 3 column connections, but misses a critical connection, then the grid might still be connected, but the tests don't confirm it.Alternatively, maybe the technician can test pairs that cover both rows and columns. For example, testing the connectivity between the top-left and bottom-right corners would cover both a row and a column. Similarly, testing the top-right and bottom-left corners would cover another row and column. So, with 2 tests, the technician can cover 2 rows and 2 columns. But that leaves 2 rows and 2 columns untested. Therefore, 2 tests are insufficient.Alternatively, testing 4 pairs that each cover a row and a column. For example, testing the top-left to bottom-right, top-right to bottom-left, top-left to top-right, and bottom-left to bottom-right. That would be 4 tests, covering all rows and columns. But does that ensure the entire grid is connected?Wait, if the technician tests the top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left, that covers the two main diagonals. Additionally, testing top-left to top-right and bottom-left to bottom-right covers the top and bottom rows. So, 4 tests in total. Does that ensure the entire grid is connected?I think it does because if the diagonals are connected and the top and bottom rows are connected, then the entire grid must be connected. However, I'm not entirely sure. There might be a way to disconnect the grid without affecting these tests.Wait, suppose there's a break in the middle of the grid, but the diagonals and top/bottom rows are still connected. Is that possible? For example, if the center node is disconnected, but the diagonals and top/bottom rows are still connected through other paths. Wait, no, because if the center node is disconnected, then the diagonals would still be connected through other nodes, so the tests would still pass even though the grid is disconnected. Therefore, 4 tests are insufficient.Therefore, going back to the earlier idea, testing 6 pairs (3 rows and 3 columns) seems necessary to ensure the entire grid is connected.But wait, another thought: in a grid, if you can confirm that each row is connected to the next row and each column is connected to the next column, then the entire grid is connected. So, for 4 rows, you need 3 tests to connect them sequentially, and for 4 columns, another 3 tests. So, 6 tests in total.Therefore, I think the minimum number of tests required is 6 for a 3x3 grid.Now, for the 5x5 grid, which has 36 nodes, the same logic would apply. The grid has 6 rows and 6 columns. To connect all rows, you need 5 tests, and to connect all columns, another 5 tests, totaling 10 tests.Wait, but let me think again. For a 5x5 grid, there are 6 rows and 6 columns. To connect all rows, you need 5 tests (connecting row 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6). Similarly, for columns, 5 tests. So, total of 10 tests.But is there a way to reduce the number of tests? For example, testing pairs that cover both rows and columns. However, similar to the 3x3 grid, testing pairs that cover both might not be sufficient because they might not cover all necessary connections.Therefore, I think the minimum number of tests required for a 5x5 grid is 10.Wait, but let me verify this. If the technician tests 5 row connections and 5 column connections, that's 10 tests. If all pass, then the entire grid is connected. If any test fails, then the grid is disconnected. Therefore, 10 tests should be sufficient.But is 10 the minimum? Could it be done with fewer tests?Suppose the technician tests 9 pairs. Is it possible that the grid is connected but the tests don't cover all necessary connections? For example, if the technician tests 4 row connections and 5 column connections, but misses a critical row connection, then the grid might still be connected, but the tests don't confirm it.Alternatively, maybe the technician can test pairs that cover both rows and columns. For example, testing the connectivity between the top-left and bottom-right corners would cover both a row and a column. Similarly, testing the top-right and bottom-left corners would cover another row and column. So, with 2 tests, the technician can cover 2 rows and 2 columns. But that leaves 4 rows and 4 columns untested. Therefore, 2 tests are insufficient.Alternatively, testing 5 pairs that each cover a row and a column. For example, testing the top-left to bottom-right, top-right to bottom-left, top-left to top-right, bottom-left to bottom-right, and center to center. That would be 5 tests, covering all rows and columns. But does that ensure the entire grid is connected?Wait, similar to the 3x3 grid, if the technician tests the diagonals and the top/bottom rows, that might not cover all necessary connections. There could be a break in the middle that isn't detected by these tests.Therefore, I think the minimum number of tests required for a 5x5 grid is 10: 5 for rows and 5 for columns.In conclusion, for a 3x3 grid (16 nodes), the minimum number of tests required is 6, and for a 5x5 grid (36 nodes), it's 10."},{"question":"It is known that ЖЖ + Ж = МЁД. What digit does the product В cdot И cdot H cdot H cdot U cdot Pi cdot У cdot X end in (different letters represent different digits, identical letters represent identical digits)?","answer":"Okay, so I have this puzzle here: ЖЖ + Ж = МЁД. Different letters represent different digits, and the same letters represent the same digits. I need to figure out what digit the product В · И · H · H · U · Π · У · X ends in. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.First, let me focus on the cryptarithmetic puzzle: ЖЖ + Ж = МЁД. I know that in such puzzles, each letter stands for a unique digit from 0 to 9, and the same letters represent the same digits. So, I need to figure out what digits Ж, М, Ё, and Д represent.Let me write this out as an addition problem:\`\`\`  ЖЖ+  Ж-----МЁД\`\`\`So, adding a two-digit number (ЖЖ) and a single-digit number (Ж) gives a three-digit number (МЁД). That tells me that the sum must carry over into a new digit. Therefore, the result of ЖЖ + Ж is a three-digit number, which means that Ж must be a digit such that when you add it to itself twice (once in the units place and once as the carryover), it results in a three-digit number.Let me denote the digits as follows:- Let Ж = a- Then, ЖЖ is 11a (since it's a two-digit number with both digits a)- Adding a single a gives 11a + a = 12a- The result is a three-digit number, which we can denote as 100m + 10e + d, where m, e, d are digits.So, 12a = 100m + 10e + d.Since 12a is a three-digit number, a must be such that 12a ≥ 100. Let's find the possible values of a.12a ≥ 100 ⇒ a ≥ 100/12 ≈ 8.33. So, a must be 9 because it's the only single-digit number greater than 8.33. Let me test a = 9.12 * 9 = 108. So, 108 is a three-digit number. Therefore, m = 1, e = 0, d = 8.So, mapping the letters:- Ж = 9- М = 1- Ё = 0- Д = 8Let me verify:ЖЖ is 99, and adding Ж (9) gives 99 + 9 = 108, which is indeed МЁД (1 0 8). Perfect, that works.Now, moving on to the second part: finding the last digit of the product В · И · H · H · U · Π · У · X.First, let me note that all these letters represent digits, and different letters represent different digits. Since we already have some digits assigned from the first part: Ж=9, М=1, Ё=0, Д=8. So, the digits 0,1,8,9 are already taken.Therefore, the remaining digits available are 2,3,4,5,6,7.So, the letters В, И, H, U, Π, У, X must each represent one of these digits, with no repeats.But wait, the problem is asking for the last digit of the product. So, regardless of the actual digits, if I can figure out the last digit of the product, that would be sufficient.To find the last digit of a product, we only need to consider the last digits of the numbers being multiplied. Since all the letters represent digits, their product's last digit is determined by the product of their individual digits modulo 10.Therefore, the last digit of В · И · H · H · U · Π · У · X is equal to (В × И × H × H × U × Π × У × X) mod 10.But since multiplication modulo 10 is commutative and associative, I can compute this step by step, taking modulo 10 at each step to simplify.However, without knowing the exact digits, it might be tricky. But perhaps there's a pattern or something that can help.Wait, let's see. The letters involved are В, И, H, U, Π, У, X. That's 7 letters, but in the product, H is multiplied twice. So, it's В × И × H² × U × Π × У × X.But since all these letters are different digits from 2,3,4,5,6,7, each used exactly once, except H which is squared.Wait, actually, no. The letters are different, so each letter represents a unique digit. So, H is one digit, and it's multiplied twice, but the other letters are different digits.So, the product is the multiplication of 7 distinct digits (since H is used twice, but it's the same digit), so in total, we have 8 digits, but with H appearing twice.But since the digits available are 2,3,4,5,6,7, and we have 7 letters, each representing a unique digit, but H is used twice. So, actually, H is one of these digits, and the other letters are the remaining digits.Wait, let me clarify:We have letters: В, И, H, U, Π, У, X. That's 7 letters. Each represents a unique digit from 2,3,4,5,6,7. So, each of these letters is assigned a unique digit from 2-7, with no repeats. H is one of these digits, and it's multiplied twice.Therefore, the product is (digit for В) × (digit for И) × (digit for H)² × (digit for U) × (digit for Π) × (digit for У) × (digit for X).So, all digits from 2-7 are used, with H being squared.So, the product is 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × (H). Wait, no, because H is one of these digits, so actually, it's (product of all digits from 2-7) × H.Wait, hold on. Let me think again.We have 7 letters: В, И, H, U, Π, У, X. Each is assigned a unique digit from 2,3,4,5,6,7. So, each digit is used exactly once, except H is used twice in the product. So, the product is (digits assigned to В, И, U, Π, У, X) multiplied together, and then multiplied by (digit assigned to H) squared.So, the product is (2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7) × H².Wait, but H is one of these digits, so actually, it's (product of digits from 2-7) × H. Because H is already included in the product, and then multiplied by H again.Wait, no. Let me clarify:If we have digits 2,3,4,5,6,7 assigned to the letters В, И, H, U, Π, У, X, each digit used exactly once. So, the product is:В × И × H × H × U × Π × У × X = (В × И × U × Π × У × X) × H².But since each of these letters is assigned a unique digit, the first part (В × И × U × Π × У × X) is the product of six unique digits, and H is the seventh digit, which is multiplied twice.But the digits available are 2,3,4,5,6,7. So, the product is (product of all six digits) × H².Wait, but H is one of these six digits, so actually, it's (product of all six digits) × H. Because H is already included in the product, and then multiplied by H again.Wait, no. Let me think differently.Suppose the digits are 2,3,4,5,6,7. Each assigned to the letters В, И, H, U, Π, У, X. So, each letter is assigned a unique digit. So, H is one digit, say h, and the other letters are assigned the remaining digits. So, the product is:(assigned digit for В) × (assigned digit for И) × h × h × (assigned digit for U) × (assigned digit for Π) × (assigned digit for У) × (assigned digit for X).Which is equal to (product of all digits assigned to В, И, U, Π, У, X) × h².But since each digit from 2-7 is used exactly once, the product of all digits is 2×3×4×5×6×7, and then multiplied by h². But wait, h is already one of these digits, so actually, it's (2×3×4×5×6×7) × h.But h is part of that product, so it's (2×3×4×5×6×7) × h = (2×3×4×5×6×7×h). But h is one of 2,3,4,5,6,7, so actually, the product is (2×3×4×5×6×7) × h, which is equal to (2×3×4×5×6×7×h). But since h is already in the product, it's just the product of all digits from 2-7 multiplied by h again.Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me approach it differently.The product is В × И × H × H × U × Π × У × X. Since each letter represents a unique digit from 2-7, except H which is used twice.So, the product is (product of all digits from 2-7) × H. Because H is one of the digits, so when we take the product of all digits from 2-7, that includes H once, and then we multiply by H again, so it's (2×3×4×5×6×7) × H.Therefore, the product is (2×3×4×5×6×7) × H.So, let me compute 2×3×4×5×6×7 first.2×3 = 66×4 = 2424×5 = 120120×6 = 720720×7 = 5040So, 2×3×4×5×6×7 = 5040.Therefore, the product is 5040 × H.But H is one of the digits from 2-7. So, the product is 5040 × H, where H ∈ {2,3,4,5,6,7}.But we need the last digit of this product. So, let's compute 5040 × H mod 10.But 5040 mod 10 is 0, because 5040 ends with a 0. So, 5040 × H mod 10 = (0 × H) mod 10 = 0.Therefore, regardless of the value of H, the last digit of the product is 0.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.Yes, 5040 is a multiple of 10, so multiplying it by any digit H will still result in a number ending with 0. Therefore, the last digit is 0.But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Is 5040 × H necessarily a multiple of 10? Yes, because 5040 is a multiple of 10, so any multiple of it is also a multiple of 10. Therefore, the last digit is 0.Therefore, the product ends with 0.But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. I considered that the product is 5040 × H because H is one of the digits from 2-7, but actually, H is already included in the 5040 product, right? Because 5040 is the product of all digits from 2-7, which includes H.Wait, hold on. If H is one of the digits from 2-7, then when I compute 2×3×4×5×6×7, that includes H once. Then, in the product, we have H squared, so it's 5040 × H.But if H is part of 5040, then 5040 already includes H once, so multiplying by H again is 5040 × H, which is 5040H.But 5040 is 504 × 10, so 5040H is 504 × 10 × H, which is 504H × 10, which is a multiple of 10, so the last digit is 0.Therefore, regardless of the value of H, the last digit is 0.So, the answer is 0.Wait, but let me make sure that the letters are assigned correctly. The letters are В, И, H, U, Π, У, X. Each is assigned a unique digit from 2-7. So, the product is the multiplication of all these digits, with H appearing twice. So, it's (product of digits 2-7) × H. But since H is one of 2-7, the product is 5040 × H, which is a multiple of 10, so last digit is 0.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the last digit is 0.**Final Answer**boxed{0}"},{"question":"Given that the sine value of the inclination angle of the line l (with a slope greater than 0) is frac{{sqrt{2}}}{2}, and the intercept on the x-axis is -2, the line l intersects the parabola C: x^{2}=2pyleft(p gt 0right) at points A and B. If |AB|=16, then p=____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of ( p ) for a parabola given some conditions about a line intersecting it. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the problem says that the sine of the inclination angle of the line ( l ) is ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), and the slope is greater than 0. I remember that the inclination angle is the angle that the line makes with the positive direction of the x-axis, measured counterclockwise. The sine of this angle is given, so I can find the angle itself.Since ( sin(theta) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), I know that ( theta ) must be ( 45^circ ) or ( 135^circ ). But since the slope is greater than 0, the angle must be ( 45^circ ) because a slope greater than 0 corresponds to an angle between 0 and 90 degrees. So, ( theta = 45^circ ).Now, the slope ( m ) of the line is equal to ( tan(theta) ). Since ( theta = 45^circ ), ( tan(45^circ) = 1 ). So, the slope ( m = 1 ).Next, the problem mentions that the intercept on the x-axis is ( -2 ). The intercept on the x-axis is the point where the line crosses the x-axis, which is when ( y = 0 ). So, the equation of the line can be written in intercept form. But since we know the slope and the x-intercept, maybe it's easier to write it in slope-intercept form.Wait, the intercept is on the x-axis at ( (-2, 0) ). So, the line passes through ( (-2, 0) ) and has a slope of 1. Let me write the equation of the line using the point-slope form.Point-slope form is ( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) ). Plugging in the point ( (-2, 0) ) and slope ( 1 ), we get:( y - 0 = 1 cdot (x - (-2)) )Simplifying:( y = x + 2 )Wait, is that right? Let me check. If the x-intercept is ( -2 ), then when ( y = 0 ), ( x = -2 ). Plugging into the equation ( y = x + 2 ), when ( x = -2 ), ( y = -2 + 2 = 0 ). That's correct. So, the equation of line ( l ) is ( y = x + 2 ).Now, this line intersects the parabola ( C: x^2 = 2py ) at points ( A ) and ( B ). We need to find the points of intersection between the line and the parabola.To find the points of intersection, I can substitute the expression for ( y ) from the line into the equation of the parabola.So, substituting ( y = x + 2 ) into ( x^2 = 2p y ), we get:( x^2 = 2p(x + 2) )Let me write that as:( x^2 = 2p x + 4p )Now, bringing all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:( x^2 - 2p x - 4p = 0 )So, the quadratic equation is ( x^2 - 2p x - 4p = 0 ). Let me denote this as ( x^2 - 2p x - 4p = 0 ).Let me denote the roots of this quadratic as ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), which correspond to the x-coordinates of points ( A ) and ( B ).From quadratic theory, I know that:( x_1 + x_2 = 2p ) (sum of roots)( x_1 x_2 = -4p ) (product of roots)Now, the distance between points ( A ) and ( B ) is given as ( |AB| = 16 ). I need to express this distance in terms of ( p ) and then solve for ( p ).First, let's find the coordinates of points ( A ) and ( B ). Since both points lie on the line ( y = x + 2 ), their coordinates are ( (x_1, x_1 + 2) ) and ( (x_2, x_2 + 2) ).The distance between ( A ) and ( B ) can be calculated using the distance formula:( |AB| = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + [(x_2 + 2) - (x_1 + 2)]^2} )Simplify the expression inside the square root:First, ( (x_2 - x_1)^2 ) is straightforward.Second, ( [(x_2 + 2) - (x_1 + 2)] = x_2 - x_1 ), so the second term becomes ( (x_2 - x_1)^2 ).Therefore, the distance becomes:( |AB| = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (x_2 - x_1)^2} )Which simplifies to:( |AB| = sqrt{2(x_2 - x_1)^2} = sqrt{2} |x_2 - x_1| )Given that ( |AB| = 16 ), we have:( sqrt{2} |x_2 - x_1| = 16 )Therefore,( |x_2 - x_1| = frac{16}{sqrt{2}} = 8sqrt{2} )So, the difference between the roots ( x_2 ) and ( x_1 ) is ( 8sqrt{2} ).But from quadratic theory, the difference of roots can be found using the formula:( |x_2 - x_1| = sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1 x_2} )Plugging in the known values from earlier:( |x_2 - x_1| = sqrt{(2p)^2 - 4(-4p)} = sqrt{4p^2 + 16p} )We know that this equals ( 8sqrt{2} ), so:( sqrt{4p^2 + 16p} = 8sqrt{2} )Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:( 4p^2 + 16p = (8sqrt{2})^2 )Calculating the right side:( (8sqrt{2})^2 = 64 times 2 = 128 )So, the equation becomes:( 4p^2 + 16p = 128 )Let me divide both sides by 4 to simplify:( p^2 + 4p = 32 )Bring all terms to one side:( p^2 + 4p - 32 = 0 )Now, we have a quadratic equation in terms of ( p ). Let me solve for ( p ) using the quadratic formula.The quadratic formula is ( p = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = 1 ), ( b = 4 ), and ( c = -32 ).Plugging in the values:( p = frac{-4 pm sqrt{16 - 4(1)(-32)}}{2(1)} )Simplify the discriminant:( sqrt{16 + 128} = sqrt{144} = 12 )So, the solutions are:( p = frac{-4 + 12}{2} = frac{8}{2} = 4 )and( p = frac{-4 - 12}{2} = frac{-16}{2} = -8 )But the problem states that ( p > 0 ), so ( p = 4 ) is the valid solution.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 2p x - 4p = 0 ), the roots are ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). The difference between the roots is ( |x_2 - x_1| = sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1 x_2} ). Plugging in the sum and product:( sqrt{(2p)^2 - 4(-4p)} = sqrt{4p^2 + 16p} ). That's correct.Setting that equal to ( 8sqrt{2} ), squaring both sides gives ( 4p^2 + 16p = 128 ). Dividing by 4: ( p^2 + 4p - 32 = 0 ). Quadratic formula: ( p = [-4 pm sqrt{16 + 128}]/2 = [-4 pm 12]/2 ). So, ( p = 4 ) or ( p = -8 ). Since ( p > 0 ), ( p = 4 ). That seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me verify by plugging ( p = 4 ) back into the original setup.If ( p = 4 ), the parabola is ( x^2 = 8y ). The line is ( y = x + 2 ). Let's find the points of intersection.Substitute ( y = x + 2 ) into ( x^2 = 8y ):( x^2 = 8(x + 2) )( x^2 = 8x + 16 )( x^2 - 8x - 16 = 0 )Using quadratic formula:( x = [8 pm sqrt{64 + 64}]/2 = [8 pm sqrt{128}]/2 = [8 pm 8sqrt{2}]/2 = 4 pm 4sqrt{2} )So, the x-coordinates are ( 4 + 4sqrt{2} ) and ( 4 - 4sqrt{2} ). Therefore, the points ( A ) and ( B ) are:( A = (4 + 4sqrt{2}, (4 + 4sqrt{2}) + 2) = (4 + 4sqrt{2}, 6 + 4sqrt{2}) )( B = (4 - 4sqrt{2}, (4 - 4sqrt{2}) + 2) = (4 - 4sqrt{2}, 6 - 4sqrt{2}) )Now, let's compute the distance between ( A ) and ( B ).Using the distance formula:( |AB| = sqrt{( (4 + 4sqrt{2}) - (4 - 4sqrt{2}) )^2 + ( (6 + 4sqrt{2}) - (6 - 4sqrt{2}) )^2} )Simplify the differences:x-difference: ( (4 + 4sqrt{2} - 4 + 4sqrt{2}) = 8sqrt{2} )y-difference: ( (6 + 4sqrt{2} - 6 + 4sqrt{2}) = 8sqrt{2} )So, the distance is:( |AB| = sqrt{(8sqrt{2})^2 + (8sqrt{2})^2} = sqrt{128 + 128} = sqrt{256} = 16 )Which matches the given condition. Therefore, ( p = 4 ) is indeed the correct solution.I think that covers all the steps. I didn't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the verification step confirms that ( p = 4 ) satisfies the condition.**Final Answer**The value of ( p ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Given the function ( f(n) ) defined on the set of natural numbers (mathbf{N}), and satisfies:[begin{array}{l}f(1) = f(2) = 1, f(3n) = 3 f(n) - 2, f(3n+1) = 3 f(n) + 1, f(3n+2) = 3 f(n) + 4 quad (n in mathbf{N}).end{array}]Determine the largest positive integer ( n ) less than or equal to 1992 for which ( f(n) = n ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest positive integer ( n ) less than or equal to 1992 such that ( f(n) = n ). The function ( f ) is defined recursively with some specific rules based on the value of ( n ) modulo 3. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let me write down the given definitions to make sure I have them clear:1. ( f(1) = f(2) = 1 ).2. For any natural number ( n ):   - If ( n ) is divisible by 3, then ( f(3n) = 3f(n) - 2 ).   - If ( n ) is one more than a multiple of 3, then ( f(3n + 1) = 3f(n) + 1 ).   - If ( n ) is two more than a multiple of 3, then ( f(3n + 2) = 3f(n) + 4 ).So, the function ( f ) is defined recursively based on the remainder when ( n ) is divided by 3. That makes me think that perhaps the behavior of ( f(n) ) is related to the base-3 representation of ( n ). Maybe I can express ( n ) in base 3 and then apply the function ( f ) digit by digit? Hmm, that might be a way to approach it.Let me test this idea with some small values to see if I can spot a pattern.Starting with ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ), both have ( f(n) = 1 ). So, ( f(1) = 1 ), which satisfies ( f(n) = n ). Similarly, ( f(2) = 1 ), which does not satisfy ( f(n) = n ). So, 1 is a fixed point, but 2 is not.Moving on to ( n = 3 ). Since 3 is divisible by 3, we use the first rule: ( f(3) = 3f(1) - 2 = 3*1 - 2 = 1 ). So, ( f(3) = 1 ), which is not equal to 3. So, 3 is not a fixed point.Next, ( n = 4 ). 4 is one more than a multiple of 3 (since 4 = 3*1 + 1), so we use the second rule: ( f(4) = 3f(1) + 1 = 3*1 + 1 = 4 ). So, ( f(4) = 4 ), which is a fixed point. Interesting.Then, ( n = 5 ). 5 is two more than a multiple of 3 (5 = 3*1 + 2), so we use the third rule: ( f(5) = 3f(1) + 4 = 3*1 + 4 = 7 ). So, ( f(5) = 7 ), which is not equal to 5.For ( n = 6 ), it's divisible by 3: ( f(6) = 3f(2) - 2 = 3*1 - 2 = 1 ). So, ( f(6) = 1 neq 6 ).( n = 7 ): 7 = 3*2 + 1, so ( f(7) = 3f(2) + 1 = 3*1 + 1 = 4 ). So, ( f(7) = 4 neq 7 ).( n = 8 ): 8 = 3*2 + 2, so ( f(8) = 3f(2) + 4 = 3*1 + 4 = 7 ). So, ( f(8) = 7 neq 8 ).( n = 9 ): 9 is divisible by 3, so ( f(9) = 3f(3) - 2 = 3*1 - 2 = 1 ). So, ( f(9) = 1 neq 9 ).( n = 10 ): 10 = 3*3 + 1, so ( f(10) = 3f(3) + 1 = 3*1 + 1 = 4 ). So, ( f(10) = 4 neq 10 ).( n = 11 ): 11 = 3*3 + 2, so ( f(11) = 3f(3) + 4 = 3*1 + 4 = 7 ). So, ( f(11) = 7 neq 11 ).( n = 12 ): 12 is divisible by 3, so ( f(12) = 3f(4) - 2 = 3*4 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 ). So, ( f(12) = 10 neq 12 ).( n = 13 ): 13 = 3*4 + 1, so ( f(13) = 3f(4) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13 ). So, ( f(13) = 13 ). That's another fixed point.Hmm, so far, the fixed points I've found are 1, 4, and 13. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me write these numbers in base 3 to see if there's something interesting.1 in base 3 is 1.4 in base 3 is 11 (since 1*3 + 1 = 4).13 in base 3 is 111 (since 1*9 + 1*3 + 1 = 13).Wait a minute, so 1, 4, 13 in base 3 are 1, 11, 111. That seems like a pattern where each subsequent fixed point is adding another '1' in base 3. So, 1 is 1, 11 is 4, 111 is 13, then maybe 1111 in base 3 would be the next fixed point? Let me check.1111 in base 3 is 1*27 + 1*9 + 1*3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40. Let me compute ( f(40) ) to see if it equals 40.To compute ( f(40) ), let's break it down:40 divided by 3 is 13 with a remainder of 1, so 40 = 3*13 + 1. Therefore, ( f(40) = 3f(13) + 1 ).We already know ( f(13) = 13 ), so ( f(40) = 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40 ). Yes! So, 40 is another fixed point.So, the fixed points seem to be numbers whose base-3 representation is all 1s. So, 1, 11, 111, 1111, etc., in base 3. Let me confirm this with another number.The next number would be 11111 in base 3, which is 1*81 + 1*27 + 1*9 + 1*3 + 1 = 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 121. Let's compute ( f(121) ).121 divided by 3 is 40 with a remainder of 1, so 121 = 3*40 + 1. Therefore, ( f(121) = 3f(40) + 1 ).We know ( f(40) = 40 ), so ( f(121) = 3*40 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 ). Perfect, so 121 is also a fixed point.Continuing this pattern, the next fixed point would be 111111 in base 3, which is 1*243 + 1*81 + 1*27 + 1*9 + 1*3 + 1 = 243 + 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 364. Let me check ( f(364) ).364 divided by 3 is 121 with a remainder of 1, so 364 = 3*121 + 1. Therefore, ( f(364) = 3f(121) + 1 ).Since ( f(121) = 121 ), ( f(364) = 3*121 + 1 = 363 + 1 = 364 ). So, 364 is also a fixed point.Continuing, the next fixed point would be 1111111 in base 3, which is 1*729 + 1*243 + 1*81 + 1*27 + 1*9 + 1*3 + 1 = 729 + 243 + 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 1093. Let me compute ( f(1093) ).1093 divided by 3 is 364 with a remainder of 1, so 1093 = 3*364 + 1. Therefore, ( f(1093) = 3f(364) + 1 ).Since ( f(364) = 364 ), ( f(1093) = 3*364 + 1 = 1092 + 1 = 1093 ). So, 1093 is a fixed point.The next one would be 11111111 in base 3, which is 1*2187 + ... but wait, 2187 is already larger than 1992, so that's beyond our limit. So, the fixed points we have are 1, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093.Wait, let me check if 1093 is less than or equal to 1992. Yes, 1093 is less than 1992. The next one would be 3280, which is way beyond 1992, so 1093 is the largest fixed point less than or equal to 1992.But wait, hold on. Let me verify if 1093 is indeed less than 1992. 1093 is definitely less than 1992, so that's a candidate. But is there a larger fixed point less than or equal to 1992?Wait, 1093 is 1111111 in base 3, which is 7 digits of 1s. The next one would be 8 digits, which would be 11111111 in base 3, which is 3^7 + 3^6 + ... + 3^0 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280, which is greater than 1992. So, 1093 is indeed the largest fixed point less than or equal to 1992.But wait, before I conclude, let me make sure that there are no other fixed points apart from these all-1s numbers in base 3. Because maybe there are other numbers that satisfy ( f(n) = n ) without being composed entirely of 1s in base 3.To check this, let me think about how ( f(n) ) behaves. The function ( f(n) ) is defined based on the digits of ( n ) in base 3. So, if I express ( n ) in base 3 as ( a_k a_{k-1} ... a_1 a_0 ), then ( f(n) ) can be expressed as a function of each digit.Wait, let me try to formalize this. Suppose ( n ) in base 3 is ( a_k a_{k-1} ... a_1 a_0 ). Then, each digit ( a_i ) can be 0, 1, or 2. Then, based on the rules given, ( f(n) ) can be built digit by digit.Let me try to see how each digit contributes to ( f(n) ). Let's consider each digit from the least significant to the most significant.Starting with the least significant digit:- If the digit is 0, then ( f(n) = 3f(n') - 2 ), where ( n' ) is the number formed by the remaining digits.- If the digit is 1, then ( f(n) = 3f(n') + 1 ).- If the digit is 2, then ( f(n) = 3f(n') + 4 ).So, each digit contributes a certain amount to the overall function. Let me see if I can express ( f(n) ) in terms of its base-3 digits.Suppose ( n ) is written as ( a_k a_{k-1} ... a_1 a_0 ) in base 3. Then,( f(n) = 3^k f(a_0) + 3^{k-1} c_{a_1} + ... + 3^0 c_{a_k} ),where ( c_{a_i} ) is a coefficient depending on the digit ( a_i ).Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps each digit contributes a certain multiple based on its position.Wait, let's consider a small example. Let's take ( n = 4 ), which is 11 in base 3. Then, ( f(4) = 4 ). Let's compute ( f(4) ) step by step:4 is 3*1 + 1, so ( f(4) = 3f(1) + 1 = 3*1 + 1 = 4 ).Similarly, for ( n = 13 ), which is 111 in base 3:13 = 3*4 + 1, so ( f(13) = 3f(4) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13 ).Similarly, 40 is 1111 in base 3:40 = 3*13 + 1, so ( f(40) = 3f(13) + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40 ).So, each time, when the digit is 1, we add 1 times 3^position, but wait, let me think.Wait, actually, each digit contributes a certain amount. Let's think recursively.Suppose ( n ) is a k-digit number in base 3, ( a_{k-1}a_{k-2}...a_0 ). Then,( f(n) = 3f(m) + c ),where ( m ) is the number formed by the higher k-1 digits, and ( c ) depends on the last digit ( a_0 ):- If ( a_0 = 0 ), ( c = -2 )- If ( a_0 = 1 ), ( c = +1 )- If ( a_0 = 2 ), ( c = +4 )So, if I unroll this recursion, I can express ( f(n) ) as:( f(n) = 3^k f(a_0) + 3^{k-1} c_{a_1} + ... + 3^1 c_{a_{k-1}} + c_{a_k} )Wait, but actually, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding a constant, so it's similar to a linear function.Wait, perhaps it's better to model ( f(n) ) as a linear transformation on the digits of ( n ). Let me try to express ( f(n) ) in terms of the digits.Suppose ( n ) in base 3 is ( a_k a_{k-1} ... a_1 a_0 ). Then, ( f(n) ) can be expressed as:( f(n) = 3 f(m) + c ),where ( m ) is ( a_k a_{k-1} ... a_1 ), and ( c ) is as above.So, recursively, this would be:( f(n) = 3(3 f(m') + c') + c = 3^2 f(m') + 3 c' + c ),and so on, until we get to the most significant digit.So, in the end, ( f(n) ) would be:( f(n) = 3^k f(a_0) + 3^{k-1} c_{a_1} + ... + 3^1 c_{a_{k-1}} + c_{a_k} ).But wait, ( f(a_0) ) is just ( f ) evaluated at the last digit. Since ( a_0 ) is a single digit in base 3, it can be 0, 1, or 2. But wait, ( f ) is defined for natural numbers, so ( a_0 ) can't be 0 if it's the leading digit, but in the recursive step, when we have ( a_0 = 0 ), it's part of a larger number.Wait, actually, when ( a_0 = 0 ), ( f(n) = 3f(m) - 2 ). So, the coefficient for the last digit is -2, for 1 it's +1, and for 2 it's +4.So, if I consider each digit ( a_i ) in base 3, starting from the least significant digit, each contributes ( c_{a_i} times 3^{i} ), where ( c_{a_i} ) is:- -2 if ( a_i = 0 ),- +1 if ( a_i = 1 ),- +4 if ( a_i = 2 ).But wait, actually, the contribution is a bit more involved because each step multiplies by 3 and adds a constant. So, it's similar to a base-3 expansion, but with coefficients.Wait, perhaps I can express ( f(n) ) as:( f(n) = sum_{i=0}^{k} c_{a_i} times 3^{i} ),where ( c_{a_i} ) is as above.But let me test this with an example. Take ( n = 4 ), which is 11 in base 3. So, digits are ( a_1 = 1 ), ( a_0 = 1 ).Then, according to this formula, ( f(n) = c_{a_1} times 3^1 + c_{a_0} times 3^0 = 1*3 + 1*1 = 4 ). Which matches.Similarly, ( n = 13 ), which is 111 in base 3. So, digits are ( a_2 = 1 ), ( a_1 = 1 ), ( a_0 = 1 ).Then, ( f(n) = 1*9 + 1*3 + 1*1 = 13 ). Which is correct.Another example: ( n = 5 ), which is 12 in base 3. So, ( a_1 = 1 ), ( a_0 = 2 ).Then, ( f(n) = c_{a_1} * 3 + c_{a_0} * 1 = 1*3 + 4*1 = 7 ). Which is correct, since ( f(5) = 7 ).Similarly, ( n = 6 ), which is 20 in base 3. So, ( a_1 = 2 ), ( a_0 = 0 ).Then, ( f(n) = c_{a_1} * 3 + c_{a_0} * 1 = (-2)*3 + (-2)*1 = -6 -2 = -8 ). Wait, that can't be right because ( f(6) = 1 ). So, my formula is incorrect.Wait, so my initial assumption that ( f(n) ) can be expressed as a sum over digits with coefficients is flawed because when ( a_i = 0 ), the coefficient is -2, but when ( a_i = 0 ) in the middle of a number, does that affect the higher digits? Maybe my approach is too simplistic.Wait, let's think again. The function ( f(n) ) is defined recursively, so each digit affects the function in a multiplicative way. So, perhaps it's better to model ( f(n) ) as a linear combination where each digit contributes a certain amount scaled by powers of 3, but with different coefficients.Wait, perhaps I can write ( f(n) ) in terms of its base-3 digits as follows:Let ( n = a_k a_{k-1} ... a_1 a_0 ) in base 3. Then,( f(n) = 3^k f(a_0) + 3^{k-1} c_{a_1} + ... + 3^1 c_{a_{k-1}} + c_{a_k} ).But wait, in this case, ( f(a_0) ) is just ( f ) evaluated at the digit ( a_0 ). Since ( a_0 ) is a single digit, ( a_0 ) can be 0, 1, or 2.But ( f(0) ) is not defined because the function is defined on natural numbers, which typically start at 1. So, perhaps ( a_0 ) cannot be 0 in the leading digit, but in the recursive steps, it can be 0.Wait, but in our earlier examples, when ( a_0 = 0 ), we had ( f(n) = 3f(m) - 2 ). So, perhaps the formula is:( f(n) = 3 f(m) + c ),where ( m ) is the number formed by removing the last digit, and ( c ) is -2, 1, or 4 depending on the last digit.So, unrolling this recursion, we can write:( f(n) = 3^k f(a_0) + 3^{k-1} c_{a_1} + ... + 3^1 c_{a_{k-1}} + c_{a_k} ).But since ( a_0 ) is a single digit, ( f(a_0) ) is known:- If ( a_0 = 0 ), ( f(a_0) ) is undefined, but in the recursion, when ( a_0 = 0 ), we have ( f(n) = 3f(m) - 2 ). So, perhaps ( f(0) ) is effectively -2/3, but that complicates things.Wait, maybe instead of trying to express ( f(n) ) in terms of its digits, I should think about the function ( f(n) ) as a transformation on the digits. Let me try another approach.Suppose I represent ( n ) in base 3, and then define ( f(n) ) based on each digit. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula.Looking back at the fixed points I found: 1, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093. These correspond to 1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, 111111, 1111111 in base 3.So, each fixed point is a number with all digits 1 in base 3. Let me see if this is a coincidence or if there's a reason behind it.Suppose ( n ) is a number with all digits 1 in base 3, i.e., ( n = sum_{i=0}^{k} 3^i ). Then, let's compute ( f(n) ).Starting from the least significant digit:- The last digit is 1, so ( f(n) = 3f(m) + 1 ), where ( m ) is the number formed by removing the last digit.But ( m ) is also a number with all digits 1 in base 3, just one digit shorter. So, recursively, ( f(m) = m ), since ( m ) is also a fixed point.Therefore, ( f(n) = 3m + 1 ). But ( m = (n - 1)/3 ), since ( n = 3m + 1 ).So, substituting, ( f(n) = 3*( (n - 1)/3 ) + 1 = (n - 1) + 1 = n ). Therefore, ( f(n) = n ) for numbers with all digits 1 in base 3.So, that explains why these numbers are fixed points.Now, the question is, are there any other fixed points besides these all-1s numbers in base 3?To check this, let's consider a number that is not composed entirely of 1s in base 3. For example, take ( n = 5 ), which is 12 in base 3. We saw earlier that ( f(5) = 7 neq 5 ). Similarly, ( n = 7 ), which is 21 in base 3, ( f(7) = 4 neq 7 ).Another example: ( n = 10 ), which is 101 in base 3. ( f(10) = 4 neq 10 ).Wait, let me try ( n = 2 ), which is 2 in base 3. ( f(2) = 1 neq 2 ).How about ( n = 8 ), which is 22 in base 3. ( f(8) = 7 neq 8 ).So, it seems that numbers with digits other than 1 in their base-3 representation do not satisfy ( f(n) = n ). Therefore, the only fixed points are the numbers composed entirely of 1s in base 3.Thus, the fixed points are numbers of the form ( frac{3^k - 1}{2} ) for ( k geq 1 ). Let me verify this formula.For ( k = 1 ): ( (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1 ). Correct.For ( k = 2 ): ( (9 - 1)/2 = 4 ). Correct.For ( k = 3 ): ( (27 - 1)/2 = 13 ). Correct.For ( k = 4 ): ( (81 - 1)/2 = 40 ). Correct.For ( k = 5 ): ( (243 - 1)/2 = 121 ). Correct.For ( k = 6 ): ( (729 - 1)/2 = 364 ). Correct.For ( k = 7 ): ( (2187 - 1)/2 = 1093 ). Correct.For ( k = 8 ): ( (6561 - 1)/2 = 3280 ). Which is greater than 1992, so we stop here.Therefore, the fixed points less than or equal to 1992 are for ( k = 1 ) to ( k = 7 ), giving us ( n = 1, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093 ).So, the largest one less than or equal to 1992 is 1093.But just to be thorough, let me check if 1093 is indeed less than or equal to 1992. Yes, 1093 is less than 1992. The next fixed point would be 3280, which is way beyond 1992, so 1093 is the largest fixed point in this range.Therefore, the answer should be 1093.**Final Answer**The largest positive integer ( n ) less than or equal to 1992 for which ( f(n) = n ) is boxed{1093}."},{"question":"Given the points overrightarrow{a}=(3,m) and overrightarrow{b}=(1,-2), if overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}+3overrightarrow{b}^{2}=0, then the real number m= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with two vectors, a and b. Vector a is (3, m) and vector b is (1, -2). The equation given is a dot b plus three times b squared equals zero. Hmm, I need to find the real number m. Alright, let me break this down step by step.First, I remember that the dot product of two vectors is calculated by multiplying their corresponding components and then adding them together. So for vectors a and b, the dot product a·b should be 3*1 + m*(-2). Let me write that out:a·b = (3)(1) + (m)(-2) = 3 - 2m.Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, the next part is 3 times b squared. Wait, b squared? Hmm, I think that might be the dot product of b with itself, right? Because when you square a vector, it often refers to the dot product. So, b squared would be b·b. Let me calculate that.Vector b is (1, -2), so b·b is 1*1 + (-2)*(-2) = 1 + 4 = 5. So, b squared is 5. Therefore, 3 times b squared is 3*5 = 15.Putting it all together, the equation given is a·b + 3b² = 0. Substituting the values I found:(3 - 2m) + 15 = 0.Now, let me solve for m. Combine the constants first:3 + 15 = 18, so the equation becomes:18 - 2m = 0.To solve for m, I can subtract 18 from both sides:-2m = -18.Then, divide both sides by -2:m = (-18)/(-2) = 9.Wait, so m is 9? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, a·b: 3*1 + m*(-2) = 3 - 2m. That seems correct.Then, b·b: 1*1 + (-2)*(-2) = 1 + 4 = 5. So, 3b² is 15. That also seems right.Adding them together: 3 - 2m + 15 = 18 - 2m. Setting that equal to zero: 18 - 2m = 0. Solving for m: -2m = -18, so m = 9. Yeah, that all checks out.I don't think I made any calculation errors here. It seems pretty straightforward. So, m must be 9.**Final Answer**The real number ( m ) is boxed{9}."},{"question":"To make pizza, together with other ingredients, Kimber needs 10 cups of water, 16 cups of flour, and 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour.

The given information is that the magnitude of vector a is 1, which is straightforward. Then, the magnitude of the vector a minus 2b is the square root of 21. Also, the angle between vectors a and b is 120 degrees. I need to find the magnitude of vector b. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.First, I remember that when dealing with vectors and their magnitudes, the dot product formula is really useful. The dot product of two vectors a and b is equal to the product of their magnitudes times the cosine of the angle between them. So, in mathematical terms, that's:a · b = |a||b|cosθGiven that the angle between a and b is 120 degrees, I can plug that into the formula. Also, since |a| is given as 1, this should simplify things a bit.Now, the other piece of information is about the magnitude of the vector a - 2b. The magnitude squared of a vector is equal to the dot product of the vector with itself. So, |a - 2b|² = (a - 2b) · (a - 2b). Let me write that down:|a - 2b|² = (a - 2b) · (a - 2b)Expanding this out, it should be:|a|² - 4(a · b) + 4|b|²Because when you distribute the dot product, you get a·a - 2b·a - 2a·b + 4b·b. But since dot product is commutative, a·b = b·a, so that becomes |a|² - 4(a·b) + 4|b|².We know that |a - 2b| is sqrt(21), so squaring both sides gives us:21 = |a|² - 4(a · b) + 4|b|²We already know |a| is 1, so |a|² is 1. Plugging that in:21 = 1 - 4(a · b) + 4|b|²Now, let's compute a · b. As I mentioned earlier, a · b = |a||b|cosθ. The angle θ is 120 degrees, so cos(120°) is equal to cos(180° - 60°) which is -cos(60°), and cos(60°) is 0.5. Therefore, cos(120°) is -0.5.So, a · b = |a||b|cos(120°) = (1)(|b|)(-0.5) = -0.5|b|Plugging this back into our equation:21 = 1 - 4(-0.5|b|) + 4|b|²Simplify the terms:First, compute -4 times (-0.5|b|): that's 2|b|So, now the equation is:21 = 1 + 2|b| + 4|b|²Let me rearrange this equation to form a quadratic equation:4|b|² + 2|b| + 1 - 21 = 0Simplify the constants:1 - 21 is -20, so:4|b|² + 2|b| - 20 = 0Hmm, that's a quadratic equation in terms of |b|. Let me write it as:4|b|² + 2|b| - 20 = 0To make it simpler, perhaps I can divide all terms by 2 to reduce the coefficients:2|b|² + |b| - 10 = 0Now, this is a quadratic equation in the form of ax² + bx + c = 0, where x is |b|. So, a = 2, b = 1, c = -10.I can solve this using the quadratic formula:x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)Plugging in the values:x = [-1 ± sqrt(1² - 4*2*(-10))] / (2*2)Compute the discriminant:sqrt(1 - 4*2*(-10)) = sqrt(1 + 80) = sqrt(81) = 9So, the solutions are:x = [-1 ± 9] / 4So, two possible solutions:First solution: [-1 + 9]/4 = 8/4 = 2Second solution: [-1 - 9]/4 = (-10)/4 = -2.5But since the magnitude of a vector can't be negative, we discard the negative solution.Therefore, |b| = 2.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from |a - 2b|² = 21, which is correct. Then expanding it as |a|² - 4(a·b) + 4|b|², that seems right.Given |a| = 1, so 1 - 4(a·b) + 4|b|² = 21.Then, a·b is |a||b|cos(120°) = (1)(|b|)(-0.5) = -0.5|b|, correct.Substituting, 1 - 4*(-0.5|b|) + 4|b|² = 21Which simplifies to 1 + 2|b| + 4|b|² = 21Then, moving 21 to the left: 4|b|² + 2|b| - 20 = 0Divide by 2: 2|b|² + |b| - 10 = 0Quadratic formula: x = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 80)] / 4 = [-1 ± 9]/4Positive solution: (8)/4 = 2, negative solution: -10/4 = -2.5So, yes, |b| = 2 is the only valid solution.Therefore, the magnitude of vector b is 2.**Final Answer**The magnitude of vector ( b ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, a_1+a_2=20, a_3+a_4=80, then S_{10}= ?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says: In the geometric sequence {a_n}, a₁ + a₂ = 20, and a₃ + a₄ = 80. Then it asks for S₁₀, which I assume is the sum of the first 10 terms. Okay, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, in general, the nth term of a geometric sequence can be written as a_n = a₁ * r^(n-1). Given that, let's write down what we know:1. a₁ + a₂ = 202. a₃ + a₄ = 80Since it's a geometric sequence, I can express a₂, a₃, and a₄ in terms of a₁ and r.So, a₂ = a₁ * rSimilarly, a₃ = a₁ * r²And a₄ = a₁ * r³So, substituting these into the given equations:1. a₁ + a₂ = a₁ + a₁*r = a₁(1 + r) = 202. a₃ + a₄ = a₁*r² + a₁*r³ = a₁*r²(1 + r) = 80Hmm, okay, so now I have two equations:1. a₁(1 + r) = 202. a₁*r²(1 + r) = 80I notice that both equations have the term a₁(1 + r). Maybe I can divide the second equation by the first to eliminate a₁(1 + r). Let me try that.Dividing equation 2 by equation 1:(a₁*r²(1 + r)) / (a₁(1 + r)) = 80 / 20Simplify the left side: a₁ cancels out, (1 + r) cancels out, so we're left with r².Right side: 80 / 20 = 4So, r² = 4Therefore, r = sqrt(4) = 2 or r = -2Hmm, so the common ratio could be 2 or -2. I need to check both possibilities.Let me first consider r = 2.If r = 2, then from equation 1: a₁(1 + 2) = 20 => a₁*3 = 20 => a₁ = 20/3 ≈ 6.666...Is that possible? Well, geometric sequences can have fractional terms, so that's fine.Alternatively, if r = -2, then equation 1 becomes a₁(1 + (-2)) = 20 => a₁*(-1) = 20 => a₁ = -20Hmm, that's also possible. So, we have two possibilities for a₁ and r:Case 1: a₁ = 20/3, r = 2Case 2: a₁ = -20, r = -2Now, I need to find S₁₀, the sum of the first 10 terms.The formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is S_n = a₁*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r), when r ≠ 1.So, let's compute S₁₀ for both cases.Case 1: a₁ = 20/3, r = 2S₁₀ = (20/3)*(1 - 2^10)/(1 - 2)First, compute 2^10: 2^10 = 1024So, numerator: 1 - 1024 = -1023Denominator: 1 - 2 = -1So, S₁₀ = (20/3)*(-1023)/(-1) = (20/3)*1023Simplify that: 20 * 1023 / 31023 divided by 3 is 341, because 3*340 = 1020, so 1023 - 1020 = 3, so 340 + 1 = 341So, 20 * 341 = ?20*300 = 600020*40 = 80020*1 = 20So, 6000 + 800 = 6800, plus 20 is 6820So, S₁₀ = 6820 in this case.Case 2: a₁ = -20, r = -2Again, using the sum formula:S₁₀ = (-20)*(1 - (-2)^10)/(1 - (-2))First, compute (-2)^10: since the exponent is even, it's positive. (-2)^10 = 1024So, numerator: 1 - 1024 = -1023Denominator: 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3So, S₁₀ = (-20)*(-1023)/3First, (-20)*(-1023) = 20*1023 = same as before, 20*1023 = 20460Then, 20460 / 3 = 6820So, S₁₀ is also 6820 in this case.Wait, that's interesting. Both cases give the same sum. So, regardless of whether r is 2 or -2, the sum S₁₀ is 6820.Therefore, the answer is 6820.But just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me double-check.In Case 1:a₁ = 20/3, r = 2Sum formula: S₁₀ = a₁*(1 - r^10)/(1 - r)Compute numerator: 1 - 2^10 = 1 - 1024 = -1023Denominator: 1 - 2 = -1So, S₁₀ = (20/3)*(-1023)/(-1) = (20/3)*102320/3 * 1023: 1023 divided by 3 is 341, so 20*341 = 6820. Correct.Case 2:a₁ = -20, r = -2Sum formula: S₁₀ = a₁*(1 - r^10)/(1 - r)Compute numerator: 1 - (-2)^10 = 1 - 1024 = -1023Denominator: 1 - (-2) = 3So, S₁₀ = (-20)*(-1023)/3 = (20*1023)/3 = 20*341 = 6820. Correct.So, both cases give the same sum, which is 6820. Therefore, the answer is 6820.I think that's solid.

For (4cos45°), since (cos45° = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}), multiplying by 4 gives (2sqrt{2}).For (left(-frac{1}{2}right)^{-2}), I recognize that a negative exponent indicates the reciprocal, so this becomes (left(-2right)^2 = 4).The term (-sqrt{8}) simplifies to (-2sqrt{2}) because (sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}).The term (left(-1right)^{2023}) is (-1) since any odd power of (-1) remains (-1).Finally, (left(2023 - piright)^0) equals 1 because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.Adding all these results together: (2sqrt{2} + 4 - 2sqrt{2} - 1 + 1).

For example, p(x) = p_{(0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0)}(x) is the polynomial of degree at most 9 such that p(0) = p(2) = p(3) = p(5) = p(7) = p(8) = p(9) = 0 and p(1) = p(4) = p(6) = 1.Find[sum_{s in S} p_s(10).]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of p_s(10) for all s in S, where S is the set of all 10-tuples with entries 0 or 1. Each p_s(x) is a polynomial of degree at most 9 that passes through the points (n, a_n) for n from 0 to 9. First, I need to understand what exactly p_s(x) is. It's a polynomial that interpolates the given 10-tuple at the points 0 through 9. Since it's a polynomial of degree at most 9, it's uniquely determined by these 10 points. So, for each s, p_s(x) is the interpolating polynomial that goes through those points.Now, I need to compute the sum over all s in S of p_s(10). That is, for every possible 10-tuple of 0s and 1s, I construct the interpolating polynomial and evaluate it at 10, then add all those evaluations together.Hmm, that seems like a lot of polynomials. Since there are 2^10 = 1024 tuples, that's 1024 polynomials. But computing each one individually and then adding them up sounds impractical. There must be a smarter way to approach this.Maybe I can think about linearity of the problem. Since each p_s(x) is a linear combination of basis polynomials, perhaps I can express the sum as a combination of sums over each basis polynomial evaluated at 10.Wait, let me recall that interpolation polynomials can be expressed using Lagrange interpolation. For each point n, the Lagrange basis polynomial L_n(x) is defined such that L_n(k) = 1 if k = n and 0 otherwise. Then, p_s(x) can be written as the sum from n=0 to 9 of a_n * L_n(x).So, p_s(x) = sum_{n=0}^9 a_n L_n(x). Therefore, p_s(10) = sum_{n=0}^9 a_n L_n(10).Therefore, the sum over all s in S of p_s(10) is equal to the sum over all s in S of [sum_{n=0}^9 a_n L_n(10)]. Since the sum is linear, I can interchange the order of summation. So, this becomes sum_{n=0}^9 [sum_{s in S} a_n L_n(10)]. But for each n, a_n is either 0 or 1, and each s is a 10-tuple where each a_n is independently 0 or 1. So, for each n, the sum over s in S of a_n L_n(10) is equal to L_n(10) multiplied by the number of s where a_n = 1.How many s have a_n = 1? Well, for each n, a_n can be 0 or 1, and the other a_k (k ≠ n) can be anything. So, for each n, there are 2^9 such s. Therefore, the inner sum is 2^9 * L_n(10).Therefore, the total sum is sum_{n=0}^9 [2^9 * L_n(10)] = 2^9 * sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(10).But wait, what is sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(10)? Let's think about that. The Lagrange basis polynomials L_n(x) satisfy sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(x) = 1 for all x, because when you evaluate at any x, the sum is 1 (since for x = k, only L_k(k) = 1 and others are 0, so sum is 1). But for x not in {0,1,...,9}, like x=10, is the sum still 1?Wait, no. That's only true when x is one of the interpolation points. For x not in the interpolation points, the sum of Lagrange basis polynomials evaluated at x is not necessarily 1. Hmm, so I need to compute sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(10).Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the polynomial Q(x) = sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(x). Since each L_n(x) is a polynomial of degree 9, Q(x) is also a polynomial of degree 9. What's Q(x)?Wait, for each x in {0,1,...,9}, Q(x) = sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(x) = 1, as each L_n(x) is 1 at x=n and 0 otherwise, so the sum is 1. Therefore, Q(x) is a polynomial of degree 9 that takes the value 1 at x=0,1,...,9. But the only polynomial of degree at most 9 that takes the value 1 at all these points is the constant polynomial 1. Wait, but a constant polynomial is degree 0, but Q(x) is degree 9. That seems contradictory. Wait, no, actually, if Q(x) is equal to 1 at 10 distinct points, then Q(x) - 1 is a polynomial of degree 9 with 10 roots, which can only be the zero polynomial. Therefore, Q(x) must be identically 1.Wait, that can't be, because Q(x) is the sum of Lagrange basis polynomials, each of which is degree 9, so their sum is also degree 9. But if Q(x) is identically 1, that's a degree 0 polynomial. So, that suggests that Q(x) is 1 for all x, which would mean that sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(x) = 1 for all x.But that's not correct because when x is not one of the interpolation points, the sum is not necessarily 1. Wait, no, actually, that's correct. Because the Lagrange interpolation formula says that for any function f, the interpolating polynomial is sum_{n=0}^9 f(n) L_n(x). If f(n) = 1 for all n, then the interpolating polynomial is sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(x), which must be the constant polynomial 1, because it's equal to 1 at 10 distinct points. So, indeed, Q(x) = 1 for all x.Therefore, sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(10) = 1. So, going back, the total sum is 2^9 * 1 = 512.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.Each p_s(x) is sum_{n=0}^9 a_n L_n(x). So, p_s(10) is sum_{n=0}^9 a_n L_n(10). Then, sum_{s} p_s(10) is sum_{s} sum_{n=0}^9 a_n L_n(10) = sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(10) sum_{s} a_n.But for each n, sum_{s} a_n is equal to the number of s where a_n = 1, which is 2^9, as each a_n is 1 in half of the tuples. So, sum_{s} a_n = 2^9. Therefore, sum_{s} p_s(10) = sum_{n=0}^9 2^9 L_n(10) = 2^9 sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(10) = 2^9 * 1 = 512.Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 512.Wait, but let me think again. Is sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(10) really equal to 1? Because when I plug x=10 into Q(x) = sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(x), which is the interpolating polynomial for f(n)=1 for all n, then Q(x) is 1 for all x, so Q(10)=1. Therefore, yes, sum_{n=0}^9 L_n(10)=1.Therefore, the total sum is 2^9 * 1 = 512.So, I think the answer is 512.**Final Answer**boxed{512}"},{"question":"Sandy likes to eat waffles for breakfast. To make them, she centers a circle of waffle batter of radius 3 cm at the origin of the coordinate plane, and her waffle iron imprints non-overlapping unit-square holes centered at each lattice point. How many of these holes are contained entirely within the area of the waffle?","answer":"Okay, so Sandy makes waffles by pouring batter in a circle with radius 3 cm centered at the origin. Then, her waffle iron makes these little square holes, each of which is a unit square. These squares are centered at each lattice point, which means their centers are at points with integer coordinates, like (1,1), (2,3), etc. The question is asking how many of these square holes are entirely within the waffle, which is the circle of radius 3 cm.Alright, so first, let me visualize this. The waffle is a circle with radius 3, so its equation is x² + y² = 9. The squares are centered at each lattice point, meaning each square is 1x1 cm, right? Because it's a unit square. So each square extends half a unit in each direction from its center. That means, for a square centered at (a, b), it goes from (a - 0.5, b - 0.5) to (a + 0.5, b + 0.5).Now, the key here is that the entire square must be inside the waffle. So, not just the center, but all four corners of the square must lie within the circle. Because if even one corner is outside, then part of the square is outside the waffle, and thus the hole isn't entirely within the waffle.So, to find the number of such squares, I need to find all integer coordinate points (a, b) such that all four corners of the square centered at (a, b) are inside the circle of radius 3.Let me formalize this. For a square centered at (a, b), the four corners are at (a + 0.5, b + 0.5), (a + 0.5, b - 0.5), (a - 0.5, b + 0.5), and (a - 0.5, b - 0.5). Each of these points must satisfy the inequality x² + y² ≤ 9.So, for each corner, we have:1. (a + 0.5)² + (b + 0.5)² ≤ 92. (a + 0.5)² + (b - 0.5)² ≤ 93. (a - 0.5)² + (b + 0.5)² ≤ 94. (a - 0.5)² + (b - 0.5)² ≤ 9But wait, actually, since the square is symmetric, if all four corners are within the circle, then the farthest point from the origin in the square is one of these four corners. So, if the farthest corner is within the circle, then all others are too. So, perhaps I can just check the maximum distance from the origin for each square.Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the distance from the origin to the center of the square, which is (a, b). Since the square extends 0.5 units in each direction, the maximum distance from the origin to any corner is sqrt((a + 0.5)^2 + (b + 0.5)^2). So, to ensure that the entire square is within the circle, this maximum distance must be less than or equal to 3.But actually, the maximum distance would be sqrt((a + 0.5)^2 + (b + 0.5)^2), but depending on the signs of a and b, the maximum could be in a different corner. For example, if a is positive and b is negative, the maximum distance corner would be (a + 0.5, b - 0.5). So, perhaps it's better to compute the maximum distance for each square.Wait, but maybe it's enough to compute the distance from the origin to the center of the square and then add the maximum possible distance from the center to a corner. The maximum distance from the center to a corner is sqrt((0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.7071 cm.So, if the distance from the origin to the center (a, b) is d, then the maximum distance from the origin to any corner is d + sqrt(0.5). So, to ensure that the entire square is within the circle, we need d + sqrt(0.5) ≤ 3.Therefore, d ≤ 3 - sqrt(0.5). Let me compute 3 - sqrt(0.5). Since sqrt(0.5) is approximately 0.7071, so 3 - 0.7071 ≈ 2.2929 cm.So, the centers (a, b) must lie within a circle of radius approximately 2.2929 cm. But since a and b are integers, we can find all integer points (a, b) such that sqrt(a² + b²) ≤ 2.2929.But wait, let me think again. Is this correct? Because the maximum distance from the origin to a corner is d + sqrt(0.5), but actually, the distance from the origin to the farthest corner is not necessarily d + sqrt(0.5). It depends on the direction. For example, if the center is at (a, b), the distance to the corner (a + 0.5, b + 0.5) is sqrt((a + 0.5)^2 + (b + 0.5)^2). Similarly, for other corners, it's sqrt((a ± 0.5)^2 + (b ± 0.5)^2). So, the maximum of these four distances must be ≤ 3.Therefore, instead of approximating, maybe it's better to compute for each integer (a, b), check whether all four corners are within the circle.But that might be tedious, but since the radius is 3, and the squares are 1x1, the possible integer coordinates (a, b) can't be too far from the origin.Let me figure out the range of a and b. Since the square is centered at (a, b), and the square extends 0.5 units in each direction, the maximum x-coordinate of the square is a + 0.5, and the minimum is a - 0.5. Similarly for y. So, to be entirely within the circle of radius 3, the square must satisfy that a + 0.5 ≤ 3, and a - 0.5 ≥ -3, similarly for b.So, a + 0.5 ≤ 3 => a ≤ 2.5. Since a is integer, a ≤ 2.Similarly, a - 0.5 ≥ -3 => a ≥ -2.5. So, a ≥ -2.Same for b: b must be between -2 and 2.So, possible integer values for a and b are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.Therefore, the centers (a, b) must be within this 5x5 grid.So, now, for each (a, b) in {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} x {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}, we need to check whether all four corners are within the circle x² + y² ≤ 9.Alternatively, since the squares are symmetric, maybe we can compute for each (a, b), the maximum distance from the origin to any corner, and if that maximum distance is ≤ 3, then the square is entirely within the waffle.So, let's compute for each (a, b), the maximum of sqrt((a ± 0.5)^2 + (b ± 0.5)^2). If this maximum is ≤ 3, then the square is entirely inside.Alternatively, since sqrt is monotonic, we can square the distances to avoid dealing with square roots.So, for each (a, b), compute the maximum of (a + 0.5)^2 + (b + 0.5)^2, (a + 0.5)^2 + (b - 0.5)^2, (a - 0.5)^2 + (b + 0.5)^2, (a - 0.5)^2 + (b - 0.5)^2. If the maximum of these is ≤ 9, then the square is entirely inside.So, let's list all possible (a, b) pairs where a and b are integers from -2 to 2.Total of 25 points.Let me make a table:1.

So, include (2, 1).Finally, (2, 2):Corners:(2 + 0.5, 2 + 0.5) = (2.5, 2.5): distance squared = 6.25 + 6.25 = 12.5(2 + 0.5, 2 - 0.5) = (2.5, 1.5): distance squared = 6.25 + 2.25 = 8.5(2 - 0.5, 2 + 0.5) = (1.5, 2.5): distance squared = 2.25 + 6.25 = 8.5(2 - 0.5, 2 - 0.5) = (1.5, 1.5): distance squared = 2.25 + 2.25 = 4.5Maximum is 12.5, which is >9. So, exclude (2, 2).Now, let's count how many squares we included.From the list above, the excluded points were:(-2, -2), (-2, 2), (2, -2), (2, 2). So, 4 points excluded.Total points considered: 25.So, included points: 25 - 4 = 21.Wait, but let me recount by the inclusion:From (-2, -2) to (2, 2), we have 25 points.Excluded were:(-2, -2), (-2, 2), (2, -2), (2, 2). So, 4 points.So, 25 - 4 = 21 points included.But let me verify by counting the included ones:From (-2, -2): excluded(-2, -1): included(-2, 0): included(-2, 1): included(-2, 2): excluded(-1, -2): included(-1, -1): included(-1, 0): included(-1, 1): included(-1, 2): included(0, -2): included(0, -1): included(0, 0): included(0, 1): included(0, 2): included(1, -2): included(1, -1): included(1, 0): included(1, 1): included(1, 2): included(2, -2): excluded(2, -1): included(2, 0): included(2, 1): included(2, 2): excludedSo, let's count the included ones:From (-2, -2): excluded(-2, -1): 1(-2, 0): 2(-2, 1): 3(-2, 2): excluded(-1, -2):4(-1, -1):5(-1, 0):6(-1, 1):7(-1, 2):8(0, -2):9(0, -1):10(0, 0):11(0, 1):12(0, 2):13(1, -2):14(1, -1):15(1, 0):16(1, 1):17(1, 2):18(2, -2): excluded(2, -1):19(2, 0):20(2, 1):21(2, 2): excludedSo, total included:21.Therefore, the number of holes entirely within the waffle is 21.But wait, let me think again. Is this correct? Because when I considered the distance from the center plus the corner distance, I approximated that d + sqrt(0.5) ≤3, which would give d ≤ ~2.2929, but when I actually checked each point, I found that some points further away, like (-2, -1), which is sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5)≈2.236, which is less than 2.2929, so it's included. Similarly, (2, -1) is also sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5)≈2.236, which is within the 2.2929 limit. So, that seems consistent.But wait, what about points like (-2, 1), which is sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5)≈2.236, which is still within the limit. So, yes, including those.But in our earlier count, we included all points except the four corners: (-2, -2), (-2, 2), (2, -2), (2, 2). So, 21 points.But let me think again: is there any other point that might have a corner exceeding the radius?Wait, for example, (1, 2): the farthest corner is (1.5, 2.5), which is sqrt(2.25 + 6.25)=sqrt(8.5)≈2.915, which is less than 3. So, that's okay.Similarly, (2, 1): same as above.But wait, (2, 1): (2.5, 1.5) is sqrt(6.25 + 2.25)=sqrt(8.5)≈2.915, which is still less than 3.Similarly, (-2, -1): (-2.5, -1.5) is sqrt(6.25 + 2.25)=sqrt(8.5)≈2.915, which is still within the circle.Wait, but what about (2, 0): (2.5, 0.5) is sqrt(6.25 + 0.25)=sqrt(6.5)≈2.55, which is within 3.Similarly, (0, 2): (0.5, 2.5) is sqrt(0.25 + 6.25)=sqrt(6.5)≈2.55, which is within.So, all the included points have their farthest corners within the circle.Therefore, the total number of holes entirely within the waffle is 21.But wait, hold on. Let me make sure that I didn't miss any points.Wait, in the initial list, I considered all points from (-2, -2) to (2, 2). But is there a possibility that some points outside this range could still have their squares entirely within the circle?Wait, earlier, I thought that a must be between -2 and 2 because a + 0.5 ≤3 and a -0.5 ≥-3, so a ≤2.5 and a ≥-2.5, hence a is integer from -2 to 2. Similarly for b.So, that's correct. Therefore, all possible centers are within that 5x5 grid.Therefore, 21 points.But wait, let me think again. When I computed for (-2, -2), the farthest corner was (-2.5, -2.5), which is sqrt(12.5)≈3.535, which is outside the circle. So, excluded.Similarly, (2, 2) is excluded.But wait, what about (2, 1): the farthest corner is (2.5, 1.5), which is sqrt(8.5)≈2.915, which is within 3.Similarly, (1, 2): same.So, yes, 21 points.But wait, hold on. Let me think about the point (2, 1). The square is centered at (2,1), which is 2 units right and 1 unit up. The square extends from (1.5, 0.5) to (2.5, 1.5). So, the farthest point from the origin is (2.5, 1.5), which is sqrt(2.5² + 1.5²) = sqrt(6.25 + 2.25)=sqrt(8.5)≈2.915, which is less than 3. So, it's included.Similarly, (2, -1): same reasoning.But wait, what about (2, 0): the square is centered at (2,0), so it goes from (1.5, -0.5) to (2.5, 0.5). The farthest point is (2.5, 0.5), which is sqrt(6.25 + 0.25)=sqrt(6.5)≈2.55, which is within 3.Similarly, (-2, 0): same.So, yes, all these points are included.Therefore, the total number of squares entirely within the waffle is 21.Wait, but let me think again: is 21 the correct answer? Because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe it's 25 minus 4, which is 21, but I want to make sure.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the number of integer points (a, b) such that (a + 0.5)^2 + (b + 0.5)^2 ≤9, considering all four corners.But that would be more complicated.Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of circles. The circle of radius 3, and the squares are unit squares centered at integer points. So, the squares that are entirely within the circle must have all four corners inside the circle.So, another way is to compute for each integer point (a, b), check if all four corners are inside the circle.Which is what I did earlier, leading to 21 points.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of integer points (a, b) such that (a + 0.5)^2 + (b + 0.5)^2 ≤9, but considering all four corners.But that's essentially what I did.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of integer points (a, b) such that the distance from the origin to (a, b) is less than or equal to 3 - sqrt(0.5). But 3 - sqrt(0.5)≈2.2929.So, integer points (a, b) where sqrt(a² + b²) ≤2.2929.So, let's compute the integer points within a circle of radius ~2.2929.So, possible integer points:a can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.Similarly, b can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.So, same as before, 25 points.Now, for each (a, b), compute sqrt(a² + b²):(-2, -2): sqrt(8)≈2.828 >2.2929: excluded(-2, -1): sqrt(5)≈2.236 <2.2929: included(-2, 0): sqrt(4)=2 <2.2929: included(-2, 1): sqrt(5)≈2.236 <2.2929: included(-2, 2): sqrt(8)≈2.828 >2.2929: excludedSimilarly for others:(-1, -2): sqrt(5)≈2.236 <2.2929: included(-1, -1): sqrt(2)≈1.414 <2.2929: included(-1, 0):1 <2.2929: included(-1, 1): sqrt(2)≈1.414 <2.2929: included(-1, 2): sqrt(5)≈2.236 <2.2929: included(0, -2):2 <2.2929: included(0, -1):1 <2.2929: included(0,0):0 <2.2929: included(0,1):1 <2.2929: included(0,2):2 <2.2929: included(1, -2): sqrt(5)≈2.236 <2.2929: included(1, -1): sqrt(2)≈1.414 <2.2929: included(1,0):1 <2.2929: included(1,1): sqrt(2)≈1.414 <2.2929: included(1,2): sqrt(5)≈2.236 <2.2929: included(2, -2): sqrt(8)≈2.828 >2.2929: excluded(2, -1): sqrt(5)≈2.236 <2.2929: included(2,0):2 <2.2929: included(2,1): sqrt(5)≈2.236 <2.2929: included(2,2): sqrt(8)≈2.828 >2.2929: excludedSo, same as before, 21 points.Therefore, the number of holes entirely within the waffle is 21.But wait, hold on. Earlier, I considered that the maximum distance from the origin to any corner is sqrt((a ±0.5)^2 + (b ±0.5)^2). So, for each (a, b), I need to check all four corners.But in the second approach, I considered that if the center is within a circle of radius 3 - sqrt(0.5), then all corners are within the circle. But actually, that might not be accurate because the maximum distance from the origin to a corner is not necessarily d + sqrt(0.5). It depends on the direction.Wait, for example, if the center is at (a, b), then the maximum distance from the origin to a corner is sqrt((a + 0.5)^2 + (b + 0.5)^2), but only if a and b are positive. If a is positive and b is negative, the maximum distance corner would be (a + 0.5, b - 0.5). So, the maximum distance is sqrt((a + 0.5)^2 + (b - 0.5)^2). Similarly, depending on the signs.Therefore, the maximum distance is not simply d + sqrt(0.5), but rather, it's the maximum of sqrt((a ±0.5)^2 + (b ±0.5)^2). So, perhaps my initial approach of checking each corner was more accurate.But in both approaches, I ended up with 21 points, so maybe it's correct.Wait, but let me think about a point like (2,1). The center is at (2,1), which is sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5)≈2.236. The maximum corner distance is sqrt(2.5² +1.5²)=sqrt(6.25 +2.25)=sqrt(8.5)≈2.915, which is less than 3. So, included.Similarly, (1,2): same.But what about a point like (2,2): center is sqrt(8)≈2.828, which is greater than 2.2929, so excluded.So, yes, 21 points.Therefore, the answer is 21.But wait, let me think again. When I first thought about the maximum distance, I thought that if the center is within 3 - sqrt(0.5), then the entire square is within the circle. But in reality, that's not exactly precise because the maximum distance from the origin to a corner is not just d + sqrt(0.5). It depends on the direction. So, for example, if the center is at (a, b), the maximum distance to a corner is sqrt((a + 0.5)^2 + (b + 0.5)^2) if a and b are positive, but if a is positive and b is negative, it's sqrt((a + 0.5)^2 + (b - 0.5)^2). So, it's not just a simple addition.Therefore, my initial approach of checking each corner is more accurate.But in both cases, I arrived at 21 points, so I think that's correct.Therefore, the number of holes entirely within the waffle is 21.**Final Answer**The number of holes entirely within the waffle is boxed{21}."},{"question":"Given the circle ( C: x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2} ), the points ( P ) and ( P' ) are on the ray starting from the origin ( O ), and they satisfy ( |OP| |OP'| = r^{2} ). Then, points ( P ) and ( P' ) are said to be symmetric with respect to the circle ( C ).

The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.First, let me make sure I understand the concept of symmetry with respect to a circle. The problem says that points ( P ) and ( P' ) are on the same ray starting from the origin ( O ), and they satisfy ( |OP| cdot |OP'| = r^2 ). Since the circle here is the unit circle, ( r = 1 ), so ( |OP| cdot |OP'| = 1 ).Okay, so if ( P ) is a point on the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ), then its symmetric point ( P' ) with respect to the unit circle should lie on the same line from the origin, but such that the product of their distances from the origin is 1.Let me denote ( P ) as ( (x, y) ). Then, ( |OP| = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ). Let me call this ( d ). So, ( d = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ). Then, the distance from the origin to ( P' ) should be ( |OP'| = frac{1}{d} ), because ( d cdot |OP'| = 1 ).Since ( P' ) is on the same ray as ( P ), it should be a scalar multiple of ( P ). So, if ( P ) is ( (x, y) ), then ( P' ) should be ( left( frac{x}{d^2}, frac{y}{d^2} right) ). Wait, let me think about that.If ( P ) is at a distance ( d ) from the origin, then ( P' ) is at a distance ( 1/d ). So, the coordinates of ( P' ) can be found by scaling ( P ) by a factor of ( (1/d)/d = 1/d^2 ). So, yes, ( P' = left( frac{x}{d^2}, frac{y}{d^2} right) ).Alternatively, since ( |OP'| = 1/|OP| ), and ( P' ) is in the same direction as ( P ), we can write ( P' = frac{1}{|OP|^2} P ). So, ( P' = left( frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}, frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} right) ).So, if ( P ) is ( (x, y) ), then ( P' ) is ( left( frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}, frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} right) ).Now, the question is asking for the equation satisfied by ( P' ). So, if ( P' ) has coordinates ( (x', y') ), then ( x' = frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} ) and ( y' = frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} ).But since ( P ) is on the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ), we can express ( x ) and ( y ) in terms of ( x' ) and ( y' ). Let me try to express ( x ) and ( y ) in terms of ( x' ) and ( y' ).From ( x' = frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} ) and ( y' = frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} ), we can write ( x = x' (x^2 + y^2) ) and ( y = y' (x^2 + y^2) ).Hmm, that seems a bit circular. Maybe I can express ( x^2 + y^2 ) in terms of ( x' ) and ( y' ). Let me denote ( S = x^2 + y^2 ). Then, ( x = x' S ) and ( y = y' S ).So, substituting back into ( S ), we get ( S = (x')^2 S^2 + (y')^2 S^2 = S^2 (x'^2 + y'^2) ).Therefore, ( S = S^2 (x'^2 + y'^2) ).Assuming ( S neq 0 ), which it isn't because ( P ) is on the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ), so ( x ) and ( y ) can't both be zero. So, we can divide both sides by ( S ):( 1 = S (x'^2 + y'^2) ).But ( S = x^2 + y^2 ), and ( x = x' S ), ( y = y' S ). So, ( S = (x')^2 S^2 + (y')^2 S^2 = S^2 (x'^2 + y'^2) ). So, this is consistent.But maybe I can express ( S ) in terms of ( x' ) and ( y' ). From ( 1 = S (x'^2 + y'^2) ), we get ( S = frac{1}{x'^2 + y'^2} ).So, ( S = frac{1}{x'^2 + y'^2} ).But ( S = x^2 + y^2 ). So, ( x^2 + y^2 = frac{1}{x'^2 + y'^2} ).But ( x = x' S ) and ( y = y' S ), so ( x^2 = (x')^2 S^2 ) and ( y^2 = (y')^2 S^2 ). Therefore, ( x^2 + y^2 = S^2 (x'^2 + y'^2) ).But we already have ( S = frac{1}{x'^2 + y'^2} ), so ( S^2 = frac{1}{(x'^2 + y'^2)^2} ). Therefore, ( x^2 + y^2 = frac{1}{(x'^2 + y'^2)^2} cdot (x'^2 + y'^2) = frac{1}{x'^2 + y'^2} ). Which is consistent with what we had before.So, maybe I can find an equation involving ( x' ) and ( y' ) by using the fact that ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ).Since ( x = x' S ) and ( y = y' S ), ( x^2 - y^2 = (x')^2 S^2 - (y')^2 S^2 = S^2 (x'^2 - y'^2) ).But ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ), so:( S^2 (x'^2 - y'^2) = 1 ).But ( S = frac{1}{x'^2 + y'^2} ), so ( S^2 = frac{1}{(x'^2 + y'^2)^2} ).Therefore, substituting back:( frac{1}{(x'^2 + y'^2)^2} (x'^2 - y'^2) = 1 ).Multiply both sides by ( (x'^2 + y'^2)^2 ):( x'^2 - y'^2 = (x'^2 + y'^2)^2 ).So, the equation satisfied by ( P' ) is ( x'^2 - y'^2 = (x'^2 + y'^2)^2 ).Looking back at the options, that's option (B): ( x^2 - y^2 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 ).Wait, but in the problem statement, the equation is for ( P' ), so in terms of ( x ) and ( y ), which are the coordinates of ( P ). But in the options, the equation is given in terms of ( x ) and ( y ), so perhaps I need to express the equation in terms of ( x ) and ( y ) as coordinates of ( P' ).Wait, hold on. Let me clarify.In the problem, ( P(x, y) ) is on the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ). Then, ( P' ) is its symmetric point with respect to the unit circle. So, ( P' ) has coordinates ( (x', y') ), which are related to ( (x, y) ) as ( x' = frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} ), ( y' = frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} ).So, the equation that ( P' ) satisfies is in terms of ( x' ) and ( y' ), but the options are given in terms of ( x ) and ( y ). So, perhaps I need to express the equation in terms of ( x ) and ( y ), treating ( x ) and ( y ) as the coordinates of ( P' ).Wait, that might be confusing. Let me rephrase.Let me denote ( P ) as ( (x, y) ), which is on the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ). Then, ( P' ) is its symmetric point with respect to the unit circle, so ( P' = left( frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}, frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} right) ).So, if ( P' ) has coordinates ( (x', y') ), then ( x' = frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} ) and ( y' = frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} ).But the question is asking for the equation satisfied by ( P' ). So, we need to find an equation in terms of ( x' ) and ( y' ), but the options are given in terms of ( x ) and ( y ). So, perhaps the equation is written in terms of ( x' ) and ( y' ), but the options are using ( x ) and ( y ) as variables. So, maybe I can just write the equation in terms of ( x ) and ( y ) as variables, treating ( x ) and ( y ) as the coordinates of ( P' ).So, if ( P' ) is ( (x, y) ), then ( x = frac{x_P}{x_P^2 + y_P^2} ) and ( y = frac{y_P}{x_P^2 + y_P^2} ), where ( P = (x_P, y_P) ) is on the hyperbola ( x_P^2 - y_P^2 = 1 ).So, let me denote ( x_P = x' ) and ( y_P = y' ), so that ( x = frac{x'}{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ) and ( y = frac{y'}{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ).But ( x' ) and ( y' ) satisfy ( (x')^2 - (y')^2 = 1 ).So, substituting ( x' = frac{x}{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ) and ( y' = frac{y}{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ) into ( (x')^2 - (y')^2 = 1 ), we get:( left( frac{x}{(x')^2 + (y')^2} right)^2 - left( frac{y}{(x')^2 + (y')^2} right)^2 = 1 ).Factor out ( frac{1}{((x')^2 + (y')^2)^2} ):( frac{x^2 - y^2}{((x')^2 + (y')^2)^2} = 1 ).So, ( x^2 - y^2 = ((x')^2 + (y')^2)^2 ).But ( x = frac{x'}{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ) and ( y = frac{y'}{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ), so ( x^2 + y^2 = frac{(x')^2 + (y')^2}{((x')^2 + (y')^2)^2} = frac{1}{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ).Therefore, ( (x')^2 + (y')^2 = frac{1}{x^2 + y^2} ).So, substituting back into the equation ( x^2 - y^2 = ((x')^2 + (y')^2)^2 ), we get:( x^2 - y^2 = left( frac{1}{x^2 + y^2} right)^2 ).Simplify the right-hand side:( x^2 - y^2 = frac{1}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} ).But wait, that's not one of the options. The options are:(A) ( x^{2} - y^{2} = x^{4} + y^{4} )(B) ( x^{2} - y^{2} = (x^{2} + y^{2})^{2} )(C) ( x^{2} - y^{2} = 2(x^{4} + y^{4}) )(D) ( x^{2} - y^{2} = 2(x^{2} + y^{2})^{2} )Hmm, so according to my calculation, the equation is ( x^2 - y^2 = frac{1}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} ), which is not among the options. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.Wait, maybe I misapplied the inversion. Let me double-check.The problem states that ( |OP| cdot |OP'| = r^2 ). Since the circle is the unit circle, ( r = 1 ), so ( |OP| cdot |OP'| = 1 ).If ( P ) is ( (x, y) ), then ( |OP| = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ). Therefore, ( |OP'| = frac{1}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} ).But the coordinates of ( P' ) would be ( left( frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}, frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} right) ), because it's in the same direction as ( P ), scaled by ( frac{1}{x^2 + y^2} ).Wait, no, actually, if ( |OP| = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ), then ( |OP'| = frac{1}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} ). So, the coordinates of ( P' ) would be ( left( frac{x}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}, frac{y}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} right) ).Wait, that's different from what I had before. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning was incorrect.Let me clarify.If ( P ) is at distance ( d ) from the origin, then ( P' ) is at distance ( 1/d ) from the origin, along the same ray. So, the coordinates of ( P' ) are ( left( frac{x}{d}, frac{y}{d} right) ), where ( d = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ).So, ( P' = left( frac{x}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}, frac{y}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} right) ).Wait, so earlier I thought it was ( frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} ), but actually, it's ( frac{x}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} ). So, that was my mistake.So, correcting that, ( P' = left( frac{x}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}, frac{y}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} right) ).Therefore, if ( P' ) has coordinates ( (x', y') ), then ( x' = frac{x}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} ) and ( y' = frac{y}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} ).So, to find the equation satisfied by ( P' ), we need to express ( x ) and ( y ) in terms of ( x' ) and ( y' ), and substitute into the hyperbola equation ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ).From ( x' = frac{x}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} ) and ( y' = frac{y}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} ), let's denote ( d = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ), so ( x' = frac{x}{d} ) and ( y' = frac{y}{d} ).Therefore, ( x = x' d ) and ( y = y' d ).Substituting into ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ):( (x')^2 d^2 - (y')^2 d^2 = 1 ).Factor out ( d^2 ):( d^2 (x'^2 - y'^2) = 1 ).But ( d = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = sqrt{(x')^2 d^2 + (y')^2 d^2} = d sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ).Therefore, ( d = d sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ).Assuming ( d neq 0 ), which it isn't because ( P ) is on the hyperbola, we can divide both sides by ( d ):( 1 = sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ).So, ( sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2} = 1 ), which implies ( (x')^2 + (y')^2 = 1 ).Wait, that's the unit circle. But ( P' ) is on the unit circle? That can't be right because ( P ) is on the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ), which doesn't necessarily lie on the unit circle.Wait, this suggests that ( P' ) is on the unit circle, but that would mean ( P' ) is on both the unit circle and the equation we're trying to find. But the options don't include the unit circle.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution.Let me go back.We have ( x = x' d ) and ( y = y' d ), where ( d = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ).So, ( d = sqrt{(x')^2 d^2 + (y')^2 d^2} = d sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ).Therefore, ( d = d sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ).Divide both sides by ( d ) (since ( d neq 0 )):( 1 = sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2} ).So, ( (x')^2 + (y')^2 = 1 ).But this would mean that ( P' ) lies on the unit circle. However, ( P ) is on the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ), so ( P' ) is its inversion with respect to the unit circle, which should lie on the inverse of the hyperbola with respect to the unit circle.Wait, but according to this, ( P' ) lies on the unit circle, which seems contradictory.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inversion formula.Let me recall that inversion in a circle with radius ( r ) centered at the origin maps a point ( P ) with coordinates ( (x, y) ) to a point ( P' ) such that ( OP cdot OP' = r^2 ) and ( P' ) lies on the ray ( OP ).So, if ( P ) is outside the circle, ( P' ) is inside, and vice versa.But in this case, the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ) has points both inside and outside the unit circle. For example, when ( y = 0 ), ( x = pm 1 ), which are on the unit circle. When ( x = 0 ), ( y^2 = -1 ), which is not real, so the hyperbola doesn't intersect the unit circle except at ( (pm 1, 0) ).So, points on the hyperbola can be inside or outside the unit circle.Wait, but if ( P ) is on the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ), then ( x^2 = 1 + y^2 ), so ( x^2 geq 1 ). Therefore, ( |OP| = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = sqrt{1 + y^2 + y^2} = sqrt{1 + 2y^2} geq 1 ). So, all points on the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ) are outside or on the unit circle. Therefore, their inverses ( P' ) will be inside the unit circle.But according to the earlier calculation, ( (x')^2 + (y')^2 = 1 ), which would mean ( P' ) is on the unit circle, but that contradicts the fact that ( P ) is outside the unit circle, so ( P' ) should be inside.Wait, so perhaps my inversion formula is incorrect.Wait, let me double-check the inversion formula.Inversion in a circle of radius ( r ) centered at the origin maps a point ( P ) with position vector ( vec{OP} ) to a point ( P' ) such that ( vec{OP'} = frac{r^2}{|vec{OP}|^2} vec{OP} ).So, if ( P ) is ( (x, y) ), then ( P' = left( frac{r^2 x}{x^2 + y^2}, frac{r^2 y}{x^2 + y^2} right) ).Since ( r = 1 ), ( P' = left( frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}, frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} right) ).Wait, so my initial thought was correct. So, ( P' = left( frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}, frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} right) ).But then, when I tried to express ( x ) and ( y ) in terms of ( x' ) and ( y' ), I got ( (x')^2 + (y')^2 = 1 ), which suggests that ( P' ) is on the unit circle, but that can't be because ( P ) is outside the unit circle, so ( P' ) should be inside.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.Let me try again.Given ( x' = frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} ) and ( y' = frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} ), let me denote ( S = x^2 + y^2 ).So, ( x' = frac{x}{S} ) and ( y' = frac{y}{S} ).Then, ( x = x' S ) and ( y = y' S ).Substitute into the hyperbola equation ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ):( (x')^2 S^2 - (y')^2 S^2 = 1 ).Factor out ( S^2 ):( S^2 (x'^2 - y'^2) = 1 ).But ( S = x^2 + y^2 = (x')^2 S^2 + (y')^2 S^2 = S^2 (x'^2 + y'^2) ).So, ( S = S^2 (x'^2 + y'^2) ).Assuming ( S neq 0 ), divide both sides by ( S ):( 1 = S (x'^2 + y'^2) ).Therefore, ( S = frac{1}{x'^2 + y'^2} ).Substitute back into the equation ( S^2 (x'^2 - y'^2) = 1 ):( left( frac{1}{x'^2 + y'^2} right)^2 (x'^2 - y'^2) = 1 ).Simplify:( frac{x'^2 - y'^2}{(x'^2 + y'^2)^2} = 1 ).Multiply both sides by ( (x'^2 + y'^2)^2 ):( x'^2 - y'^2 = (x'^2 + y'^2)^2 ).So, the equation satisfied by ( P' ) is ( x'^2 - y'^2 = (x'^2 + y'^2)^2 ).Therefore, in terms of ( x ) and ( y ) as the coordinates of ( P' ), the equation is ( x^2 - y^2 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 ), which is option (B).Wait, but earlier I thought that ( P' ) would lie inside the unit circle, but according to this equation, ( x^2 - y^2 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 ), which doesn't necessarily imply that ( x^2 + y^2 < 1 ). Let me check with a specific point.Take ( P = (1, 0) ) on the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ). Then, ( P' ) is ( left( frac{1}{1^2 + 0^2}, frac{0}{1^2 + 0^2} right) = (1, 0) ). So, ( P' ) is also ( (1, 0) ), which is on the unit circle.Another point: ( P = (sqrt{2}, 1) ). Check if it's on the hyperbola: ( (sqrt{2})^2 - 1^2 = 2 - 1 = 1 ). So, yes. Then, ( |OP| = sqrt{2 + 1} = sqrt{3} ). So, ( |OP'| = 1/sqrt{3} ). Therefore, ( P' = left( frac{sqrt{2}}{3}, frac{1}{3} right) ).Check if this satisfies the equation ( x^2 - y^2 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 ):Left-hand side: ( left( frac{sqrt{2}}{3} right)^2 - left( frac{1}{3} right)^2 = frac{2}{9} - frac{1}{9} = frac{1}{9} ).Right-hand side: ( left( left( frac{sqrt{2}}{3} right)^2 + left( frac{1}{3} right)^2 right)^2 = left( frac{2}{9} + frac{1}{9} right)^2 = left( frac{3}{9} right)^2 = left( frac{1}{3} right)^2 = frac{1}{9} ).So, yes, it satisfies the equation.Another test: ( P = (cosh t, sinh t) ), which is on the hyperbola ( x^2 - y^2 = 1 ). Then, ( P' = left( frac{cosh t}{cosh^2 t + sinh^2 t}, frac{sinh t}{cosh^2 t + sinh^2 t} right) ).But ( cosh^2 t + sinh^2 t = cosh(2t) ). So, ( P' = left( frac{cosh t}{cosh(2t)}, frac{sinh t}{cosh(2t)} right) ).Now, let's compute ( x^2 - y^2 ):( left( frac{cosh t}{cosh(2t)} right)^2 - left( frac{sinh t}{cosh(2t)} right)^2 = frac{cosh^2 t - sinh^2 t}{cosh^2(2t)} = frac{1}{cosh^2(2t)} ).Now, compute ( (x^2 + y^2)^2 ):( left( left( frac{cosh t}{cosh(2t)} right)^2 + left( frac{sinh t}{cosh(2t)} right)^2 right)^2 = left( frac{cosh^2 t + sinh^2 t}{cosh^2(2t)} right)^2 = left( frac{cosh(2t)}{cosh^2(2t)} right)^2 = left( frac{1}{cosh(2t)} right)^2 = frac{1}{cosh^2(2t)} ).So, ( x^2 - y^2 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 ), which confirms that the equation holds.Therefore, despite ( P' ) being inside the unit circle for points ( P ) outside, the equation ( x^2 - y^2 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 ) is satisfied by ( P' ).So, the correct answer is option (B).**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"The matrix[begin{pmatrix} a & 3  -8 & d end{pmatrix}]is its own inverse, for some real numbers a and d.  Find the number of possible pairs (a,d).","answer":"Okay, so I have this matrix problem where the matrix is its own inverse. The matrix is given as:[begin{pmatrix} a & 3  -8 & d end{pmatrix}]And I need to find the number of possible pairs (a, d) where a and d are real numbers. Hmm, okay. So, if a matrix is its own inverse, that means when you multiply the matrix by itself, you get the identity matrix. Let me write that down.So, if M is the matrix, then M * M = I, where I is the identity matrix. So, let me denote M as:[M = begin{pmatrix} a & 3  -8 & d end{pmatrix}]Therefore, M squared should be equal to the identity matrix:[M^2 = M times M = I = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0  0 & 1 end{pmatrix}]Alright, so I need to compute M squared and set it equal to the identity matrix, then solve for a and d. Let me compute M squared.Multiplying two 2x2 matrices:[M times M = begin{pmatrix} a & 3  -8 & d end{pmatrix} times begin{pmatrix} a & 3  -8 & d end{pmatrix}]So, let's compute each element of the resulting matrix.First element (top-left):a * a + 3 * (-8) = a² - 24Second element (top-right):a * 3 + 3 * d = 3a + 3dThird element (bottom-left):-8 * a + d * (-8) = -8a - 8dFourth element (bottom-right):-8 * 3 + d * d = -24 + d²So, putting it all together, M squared is:[begin{pmatrix} a² - 24 & 3a + 3d  -8a - 8d & d² - 24 end{pmatrix}]And this should equal the identity matrix:[begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0  0 & 1 end{pmatrix}]So, setting each corresponding element equal, we get the following system of equations:1. a² - 24 = 12. 3a + 3d = 03. -8a - 8d = 04. d² - 24 = 1So, now I have four equations. Let me write them out:1. a² - 24 = 12. 3a + 3d = 03. -8a - 8d = 04. d² - 24 = 1Hmm, okay. Let's see. Equations 2 and 3 look similar. Let me check if they are consistent.Equation 2: 3a + 3d = 0. If I divide both sides by 3, I get a + d = 0.Equation 3: -8a -8d = 0. If I factor out -8, I get -8(a + d) = 0. Which simplifies to a + d = 0 as well.So, equations 2 and 3 are the same. So, we only have three unique equations:1. a² - 24 = 12. a + d = 03. d² - 24 = 1So, let's solve equation 1 first:1. a² - 24 = 1   So, a² = 25   Therefore, a = 5 or a = -5Similarly, equation 3:3. d² - 24 = 1   So, d² = 25   Therefore, d = 5 or d = -5Now, equation 2 says a + d = 0, which implies that d = -a.So, let's consider the possible values of a and d.Case 1: a = 5Then, d = -a = -5Case 2: a = -5Then, d = -a = 5So, these are the two possible pairs: (5, -5) and (-5, 5)Wait, but let me check if these satisfy all equations.First, for (5, -5):Check equation 1: 5² -24 = 25 -24 =1 ✔️Equation 2: 5 + (-5) = 0 ✔️Equation 3: (-5)² -24 =25 -24=1 ✔️Similarly, for (-5,5):Equation 1: (-5)² -24=25-24=1 ✔️Equation 2: (-5) +5=0 ✔️Equation 3:5² -24=25-24=1 ✔️So, both pairs satisfy all equations.Therefore, there are two possible pairs: (5, -5) and (-5,5)Hence, the number of possible pairs (a,d) is 2.Wait, hold on, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the matrix is its own inverse, so M²=I. We found that a and d must satisfy a²=25, d²=25, and a + d=0. So, a and d are negatives of each other, and both have magnitude 5. So, the only possibilities are (5,-5) and (-5,5). So, yeah, that's two pairs.Is there any other possibility? Let me think. Suppose a and d are both 5, but then a + d=10≠0, which doesn't satisfy equation 2. Similarly, if both are -5, then a + d=-10≠0. So, only the pairs where one is 5 and the other is -5 work.Therefore, the number of possible pairs is 2.**Final Answer**The number of possible pairs ((a, d)) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"In the cafeteria, a meal box consists of one main dish and one stir-fry dish.Given:Today's lunch:Main dishes: rice, noodlesStir-fry dishes: potato slices, mapo tofu, tomato scrambled eggs, fried potatoesThere are a total of boxed{text{answer}} different meal combinations.","answer":"First, identify the number of main dishes available.

On a certain section of the route near station ( B ), repair work is being carried out, and on this section, the train is allowed a speed that is only ( frac{1}{n} ) of its original speed, resulting in the train arriving at station ( B ) ( a ) hours late. The next day, the repair work front moved ( b ) kilometers closer to station ( B ), and under the same conditions, the train was delayed by only ( c ) hours. Find the speed of the train.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a train traveling from station A to station B. There's some repair work happening near station B, which causes the train to slow down on a certain section. Because of this, the train arrives late. The next day, the repair work moves closer to B, and the delay is less. I need to find the speed of the train.Let me try to break this down step by step. Maybe I can visualize the route. There's station A and station B, with some distance between them. Let's denote the total distance between A and B as D kilometers. The train's original speed is what we need to find, let's call it v km/h.On the first day, there's a section near B where the train has to slow down. Let's say the length of this section is x kilometers. On this section, the train's speed is reduced to 1/n of its original speed, so the speed becomes v/n km/h.Because of this slowdown, the train arrives a hours late. So, the time taken on the first day is more than the usual time. Let's denote the usual time without any slowdown as T hours. Then, the time taken on the first day is T + a.On the next day, the repair work moves b kilometers closer to B. So, the length of the section where the train has to slow down becomes x - b kilometers. The speed on this section is still v/n km/h. The delay this time is only c hours, so the time taken is T + c.I think I can set up equations based on the time taken each day.First, let's find the usual time T. Since the total distance is D and the speed is v, T = D / v.On the first day, the train travels (D - x) kilometers at speed v, and x kilometers at speed v/n. So, the total time is:Time_day1 = (D - x)/v + x/(v/n) = (D - x)/v + (x * n)/vThis should equal T + a, which is D/v + a.So, equation 1:(D - x)/v + (x * n)/v = D/v + aSimplify this equation:(D - x)/v + (x * n)/v = D/v + aMultiply both sides by v to eliminate denominators:(D - x) + x * n = D + a * vSimplify the left side:D - x + x * n = D + a * vSubtract D from both sides:(-x + x * n) = a * vFactor out x:x(n - 1) = a * vSo, x = (a * v) / (n - 1)Okay, that's one equation.Now, on the second day, the repair section is shorter by b kilometers, so the length is x - b. Similarly, the time taken is:Time_day2 = (D - (x - b))/v + (x - b)/(v/n) = (D - x + b)/v + (x - b) * n / vThis should equal T + c, which is D/v + c.So, equation 2:(D - x + b)/v + (x - b) * n / v = D/v + cAgain, multiply both sides by v:(D - x + b) + (x - b) * n = D + c * vSimplify the left side:D - x + b + x * n - b * n = D + c * vCombine like terms:D + (-x + x * n) + (b - b * n) = D + c * vSubtract D from both sides:(-x + x * n) + (b - b * n) = c * vFactor out x and b:x(n - 1) + b(1 - n) = c * vWe already have an expression for x from equation 1: x = (a * v)/(n - 1)So, substitute x into equation 2:[(a * v)/(n - 1)] * (n - 1) + b(1 - n) = c * vSimplify:(a * v) + b(1 - n) = c * vNow, let's solve for v:a * v + b(1 - n) = c * vBring terms with v to one side:a * v - c * v = -b(1 - n)Factor out v:v(a - c) = -b(1 - n)Simplify the right side:v(a - c) = b(n - 1)So, solve for v:v = [b(n - 1)] / (a - c)Hmm, that seems okay. Let me check the steps again.Wait, in equation 2, when I substituted x, I had:x(n - 1) + b(1 - n) = c * vBut x(n - 1) is equal to a * v from equation 1, right? Because x(n - 1) = a * v.So, substituting that in:a * v + b(1 - n) = c * vWhich is the same as:a * v - c * v = -b(n - 1)So, v(a - c) = b(n - 1)Therefore, v = [b(n - 1)] / (a - c)Yes, that seems consistent.Wait, but let me think about the units. The speed v should have units of km/h. Let's see, b is in km, n is dimensionless, a and c are in hours. So, numerator is km*(dimensionless), denominator is hours. So, km/h, which is correct.So, the speed of the train is [b(n - 1)] / (a - c) km/h.Let me see if this makes sense. If a > c, which it should be because the delay is less the next day, so a - c is positive. And n is greater than 1 because the speed is reduced, so n - 1 is positive. So, v is positive, which makes sense.Alternatively, if a < c, which would mean the delay increased, but that contradicts the problem statement, so we can assume a > c.Let me test with some numbers to see if it makes sense.Suppose n = 2, so the speed is halved on the repair section. Let’s say a = 2 hours late, c = 1 hour late, and b = 10 km.Then, v = [10*(2 - 1)] / (2 - 1) = 10 / 1 = 10 km/h.Wait, let's see if that works.First day: x = (a * v)/(n - 1) = (2 * 10)/(2 - 1) = 20 km.So, the repair section is 20 km long.Time_day1: (D - 20)/10 + 20/(10/2) = (D - 20)/10 + 20/5 = (D - 20)/10 + 4Usual time T = D / 10So, Time_day1 = T - 20/10 + 4 = T - 2 + 4 = T + 2, which matches a = 2.Second day: repair section is 20 - 10 = 10 km.Time_day2: (D - 10)/10 + 10/(10/2) = (D - 10)/10 + 10/5 = (D - 10)/10 + 2Usual time T = D / 10So, Time_day2 = T - 10/10 + 2 = T - 1 + 2 = T + 1, which matches c = 1.So, in this case, the speed is 10 km/h, which seems correct.Another test case: n = 3, a = 3, c = 1, b = 15.Then, v = [15*(3 - 1)] / (3 - 1) = (15*2)/2 = 15 km/h.First day: x = (3 * 15)/(3 - 1) = 45 / 2 = 22.5 km.Time_day1: (D - 22.5)/15 + 22.5/(15/3) = (D - 22.5)/15 + 22.5/5 = (D - 22.5)/15 + 4.5Usual time T = D / 15So, Time_day1 = T - 22.5/15 + 4.5 = T - 1.5 + 4.5 = T + 3, which is correct.Second day: repair section is 22.5 - 15 = 7.5 km.Time_day2: (D - 7.5)/15 + 7.5/(15/3) = (D - 7.5)/15 + 7.5/5 = (D - 7.5)/15 + 1.5Usual time T = D / 15So, Time_day2 = T - 7.5/15 + 1.5 = T - 0.5 + 1.5 = T + 1, which is correct.So, the formula seems to hold in these test cases.Therefore, I think the speed of the train is [b(n - 1)] / (a - c) km/h.**Final Answer**The speed of the train is boxed{dfrac{b(n - 1)}{a - c}} kilometers per hour."},{"question":"The straight river is one and a half kilometers wide and has a current of  8  kilometers per hour. A boat capable of traveling  10  kilometers per hour in still water, sets out across the water. How many minutes will it take the boat to reach a point directly across from where it started?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a boat crossing a straight river. Let me try to visualize it first. The river is 1.5 kilometers wide, and it has a current flowing at 8 kilometers per hour. There's a boat that can travel at 10 kilometers per hour in still water. The boat wants to go directly across the river to a point directly opposite its starting point. I need to figure out how long this will take.Hmm, okay. So, in still water, the boat can go 10 km/h. But in a river with a current, the boat's actual path will be affected by the current. The current is 8 km/h, which is pretty strong. So, if the boat just points straight across, the current will carry it downstream. But the problem says the boat wants to reach a point directly across, so the boat must aim upstream at an angle to counteract the current.I remember from physics that when dealing with vectors, like velocity, you can break them into components. So, the boat's velocity relative to the water has two components: one across the river and one upstream. The upstream component needs to cancel out the downstream current so that the resultant path is straight across.Let me denote the boat's velocity relative to the water as vector **v_b** and the river's current as vector **v_r**. The resultant velocity **v** will be the vector sum of **v_b** and **v_r**. Since the boat wants to go straight across, the resultant velocity should have no downstream component. That means the upstream component of the boat's velocity must equal the downstream current.So, if I consider the boat's velocity relative to the water, it can be broken into two components: one perpendicular to the current (let's say along the y-axis) and one parallel to the current (along the x-axis). The perpendicular component is what will take the boat across the river, and the parallel component is what will counteract the current.Let me assign some variables. Let's say the boat's speed relative to the water is 10 km/h, so the magnitude of **v_b** is 10 km/h. The current's speed is 8 km/h, so the magnitude of **v_r** is 8 km/h. The boat needs to aim upstream at an angle θ such that the x-component of **v_b** cancels out the current.So, the x-component of the boat's velocity is 10 * sin(θ), and this needs to equal the current's speed of 8 km/h. Wait, is that right? Let me think. If the boat is pointing upstream, the angle θ is measured from the y-axis towards the upstream direction. So, the x-component would actually be 10 * sin(θ), and the y-component would be 10 * cos(θ). So, yes, to counteract the current, 10 * sin(θ) = 8 km/h.Let me write that equation:10 * sin(θ) = 8So, sin(θ) = 8/10 = 0.8Therefore, θ = arcsin(0.8). Let me calculate that. Arcsin(0.8) is approximately 53.13 degrees. So, the boat needs to aim upstream at about 53 degrees to counteract the current.Now, the component of the boat's velocity that's actually taking it across the river is the y-component, which is 10 * cos(θ). Let me compute that.cos(53.13 degrees) is approximately 0.6, since sin^2θ + cos^2θ = 1, so cosθ = sqrt(1 - 0.64) = sqrt(0.36) = 0.6.So, the y-component is 10 * 0.6 = 6 km/h. That means the boat is moving across the river at 6 km/h.Now, the river is 1.5 km wide. So, the time it takes to cross is the distance divided by the speed. So, time t = 1.5 km / 6 km/h.Calculating that, t = 0.25 hours. To convert that into minutes, I multiply by 60 minutes per hour.0.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 15 minutes.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my reasoning. So, the boat's effective speed across the river is 6 km/h because it's using part of its speed to counteract the current. The distance is 1.5 km, so time is 1.5 / 6 = 0.25 hours, which is 15 minutes. That seems correct.Alternatively, I can think about the resultant velocity vector. The boat's velocity relative to the ground is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the water and the water's velocity relative to the ground. So, if the boat aims upstream at angle θ, its velocity relative to the ground is (10 sinθ - 8) i + (10 cosθ) j. But since we want the resultant velocity to have no i-component, 10 sinθ - 8 = 0, so sinθ = 0.8 as before. Then, the j-component is 10 cosθ = 6 km/h, so the time is 1.5 / 6 = 0.25 hours, which is 15 minutes.Yes, that seems consistent.Wait, another way to think about it is using relative velocity. The boat's velocity relative to the water is 10 km/h at an angle θ upstream. The water is moving downstream at 8 km/h. So, the boat's velocity relative to the ground is 10 km/h at θ upstream plus 8 km/h downstream. So, in the x-direction, it's 10 sinθ - 8, and in the y-direction, it's 10 cosθ. Again, setting x-component to zero gives 10 sinθ = 8, so sinθ = 0.8, and the y-component is 6 km/h. So, same result.Alternatively, could I have used the Pythagorean theorem on the velocities? Let me see. The boat's speed relative to water is 10 km/h, and the current is 8 km/h. If the boat aims upstream, the resultant speed relative to ground is sqrt(10^2 - 8^2) = sqrt(100 - 64) = sqrt(36) = 6 km/h. Wait, that's the same as the y-component. So, that's another way to see it. The resultant speed across is 6 km/h, so time is 1.5 / 6 = 0.25 hours, 15 minutes.Yes, that's a quicker way. So, the resultant speed across is sqrt(10^2 - 8^2) = 6 km/h, so time is 1.5 / 6 = 0.25 hours, which is 15 minutes.So, all methods lead to the same answer, 15 minutes. Therefore, I think that's correct.**Final Answer**The boat will take boxed{15} minutes to reach a point directly across from where it started."},{"question":"Among the positive integers less than 10^{4}, how many positive integers n are there such that 2^{n} - n^{2} is divisible by 7?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Among the positive integers less than 10,000, how many positive integers n are there such that 2^n - n^2 is divisible by 7? Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I need to find all n < 10,000 where 2^n - n^2 is divisible by 7. In other words, 2^n ≡ n^2 mod 7. So, I need to find n such that when I compute 2^n modulo 7 and n^2 modulo 7, they are equal.I remember that for modular arithmetic, especially with exponents, it's helpful to look for patterns or cycles. Maybe 2^n modulo 7 has a cycle, and similarly, n^2 modulo 7 might have some pattern. Let me explore both.Starting with 2^n mod 7. Let's compute the powers of 2 modulo 7:2^1 = 2 mod 72^2 = 4 mod 72^3 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 72^4 = 16 ≡ 2 mod 72^5 = 32 ≡ 4 mod 72^6 = 64 ≡ 1 mod 7Wait, so it seems like the cycle repeats every 3 exponents: 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, etc. So, the period is 3. That means 2^n mod 7 cycles through 2, 4, 1 every three exponents. So, depending on n mod 3, 2^n mod 7 can be determined.Similarly, let's look at n^2 mod 7. The squares modulo 7 can be computed as follows:For n from 0 to 6:0^2 = 0 mod 71^2 = 1 mod 72^2 = 4 mod 73^2 = 9 ≡ 2 mod 74^2 = 16 ≡ 2 mod 75^2 = 25 ≡ 4 mod 76^2 = 36 ≡ 1 mod 7So, the possible quadratic residues modulo 7 are 0, 1, 2, and 4. So, n^2 mod 7 can only be 0, 1, 2, or 4. That's useful.Therefore, to have 2^n ≡ n^2 mod 7, both sides must be equal to one of these residues: 0, 1, 2, or 4. But 2^n mod 7 cycles through 2, 4, 1. It never hits 0. So, 2^n mod 7 can be 2, 4, or 1. Therefore, n^2 mod 7 must also be 2, 4, or 1. It can't be 0 because 2^n is never 0 mod 7.So, n^2 mod 7 must be in {1, 2, 4}. Let's see when that happens. From above, n^2 mod 7 is:- 0 if n ≡ 0 mod 7- 1 if n ≡ 1 or 6 mod 7- 2 if n ≡ 3 or 4 mod 7- 4 if n ≡ 2 or 5 mod 7Therefore, n^2 mod 7 is 1, 2, or 4 when n is not congruent to 0 mod 7. So, n must not be a multiple of 7.So, n can be congruent to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 mod 7. Each of these gives a specific value for n^2 mod 7:- If n ≡ 1 or 6 mod 7, then n^2 ≡ 1 mod 7- If n ≡ 2 or 5 mod 7, then n^2 ≡ 4 mod 7- If n ≡ 3 or 4 mod 7, then n^2 ≡ 2 mod 7So, depending on n mod 7, n^2 mod 7 is 1, 4, or 2. Now, 2^n mod 7 cycles through 2, 4, 1 every 3 exponents. So, 2^n mod 7 is:- 2 when n ≡ 1 mod 3- 4 when n ≡ 2 mod 3- 1 when n ≡ 0 mod 3Therefore, to have 2^n ≡ n^2 mod 7, we need:Case 1: 2^n ≡ 1 mod 7 and n^2 ≡ 1 mod 7Case 2: 2^n ≡ 2 mod 7 and n^2 ≡ 2 mod 7Case 3: 2^n ≡ 4 mod 7 and n^2 ≡ 4 mod 7Let me analyze each case separately.Case 1: 2^n ≡ 1 mod 7 and n^2 ≡ 1 mod 7From above, 2^n ≡ 1 mod 7 when n ≡ 0 mod 3.n^2 ≡ 1 mod 7 when n ≡ 1 or 6 mod 7.So, in this case, n must satisfy both n ≡ 0 mod 3 and n ≡ 1 or 6 mod 7.So, we can write this as n ≡ 0 mod 3 and n ≡ 1 mod 7 or n ≡ 6 mod 7.We can solve these congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).First, n ≡ 0 mod 3 and n ≡ 1 mod 7.Let me find n such that n ≡ 0 mod 3 and n ≡ 1 mod 7.Let n = 3k. Then, 3k ≡ 1 mod 7 => 3k ≡ 1 mod 7.Multiplicative inverse of 3 mod 7 is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.Therefore, k ≡ 5*1 ≡5 mod7.So, k=7m +5, so n=3*(7m +5)=21m +15.Thus, n ≡15 mod21.Similarly, for n ≡0 mod3 and n≡6 mod7.Let n=3k. Then, 3k≡6 mod7 => 3k≡6 mod7.Divide both sides by 3: k≡2 mod7.Therefore, k=7m +2, so n=3*(7m +2)=21m +6.Thus, n≡6 mod21.Therefore, in Case 1, n must be ≡6 or 15 mod21.Case 2: 2^n ≡2 mod7 and n^2≡2 mod7From above, 2^n≡2 mod7 when n≡1 mod3.n^2≡2 mod7 when n≡3 or4 mod7.So, n must satisfy n≡1 mod3 and n≡3 or4 mod7.Again, using CRT.First, n≡1 mod3 and n≡3 mod7.Let n=3k +1. Then, 3k +1≡3 mod7 => 3k≡2 mod7.Multiplicative inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, so k≡2*5=10≡3 mod7.Thus, k=7m +3, so n=3*(7m +3)+1=21m +10.Thus, n≡10 mod21.Second, n≡1 mod3 and n≡4 mod7.Let n=3k +1. Then, 3k +1≡4 mod7 =>3k≡3 mod7 =>k≡1 mod7.Thus, k=7m +1, so n=3*(7m +1)+1=21m +4.Thus, n≡4 mod21.Therefore, in Case 2, n must be ≡4 or10 mod21.Case 3: 2^n≡4 mod7 and n^2≡4 mod7From above, 2^n≡4 mod7 when n≡2 mod3.n^2≡4 mod7 when n≡2 or5 mod7.So, n must satisfy n≡2 mod3 and n≡2 or5 mod7.Again, using CRT.First, n≡2 mod3 and n≡2 mod7.Let n=3k +2. Then, 3k +2≡2 mod7 =>3k≡0 mod7 =>k≡0 mod7.Thus, k=7m, so n=3*7m +2=21m +2.Thus, n≡2 mod21.Second, n≡2 mod3 and n≡5 mod7.Let n=3k +2. Then, 3k +2≡5 mod7 =>3k≡3 mod7 =>k≡1 mod7.Thus, k=7m +1, so n=3*(7m +1)+2=21m +5.Thus, n≡5 mod21.Therefore, in Case 3, n must be ≡2 or5 mod21.So, compiling all the results from the three cases:Case 1: n≡6 or15 mod21Case 2: n≡4 or10 mod21Case 3: n≡2 or5 mod21So, altogether, the solutions are n≡2,4,5,6,10,15 mod21.Therefore, the solutions are numbers congruent to 2,4,5,6,10,15 modulo21.So, in each block of 21 consecutive numbers, there are 6 numbers that satisfy the condition.Now, since we are looking for n <10,000, we need to find how many such n exist below 10,000.First, let's compute how many complete blocks of 21 are there below 10,000.Compute 10,000 divided by21.10,000 ÷21 ≈476.190...So, there are 476 complete blocks, each contributing 6 solutions.So, 476 *6=2856.But we also need to check the remaining numbers beyond 476*21=9996.So, 10,000 -9996=4. So, we need to check numbers from9997 to9999 (since n must be less than10,000, so up to9999).So, let's see which numbers in9997,9998,9999 are congruent to2,4,5,6,10,15 mod21.First, compute9997 mod21.Compute9996 is divisible by21 (since476*21=9996). So,9997≡1 mod219998≡2 mod219999≡3 mod21So, in the range9997 to9999:9997≡1 mod21 – not in our list9998≡2 mod21 – which is in our list (2)9999≡3 mod21 – not in our listSo, only9998 is a solution in the remaining numbers.Therefore, total number of solutions is476*6 +1=2856 +1=2857.Wait, but hold on. Let me verify this.Wait, 476 blocks give 476*21=9996. So, numbers from1 to9996.Then, numbers from9997 to9999: three numbers.We found that9998 is a solution.But wait, n must be less than10,000, so n can be up to9999.But in our earlier computation, we considered n up to9999, but in the blocks, we have n up to9996, then check9997-9999.But let me confirm if9998 is less than10,000 – yes, it is.But hold on, when we compute n≡2 mod21, and9998≡2 mod21, so9998 is a solution.So, total solutions:476*6 +1=2857.But wait, let me check if n=0 is included? The problem says positive integers, so n starts at1.But in our earlier analysis, n≡2,4,5,6,10,15 mod21. So, starting from n=2,4,5,6,10,15, etc.But in the first block, n=1 to21, how many solutions are there?Let me list them:n=2,4,5,6,10,15.So, six numbers. So, starting from n=2, which is positive integer.So, our count is correct.But let me check if n=21 is included? n=21 would be in the next block, but n=21 is 21≡0 mod21, which is not in our list. So, n=21 is not a solution.Wait, but wait, n=21: 2^21 -21^2.But 2^21 mod7: since2^3≡1 mod7, so2^21=(2^3)^7≡1^7≡1 mod7.21^2=441≡0 mod7.So, 2^21 -21^2≡1 -0≡1 mod7, which is not 0. So, n=21 is not a solution, which is consistent with our earlier result.So, our initial count is correct.But just to make sure, let's check n=2,4,5,6,10,15:n=2:2^2=4, 2^2=4, 4-4=0, which is divisible by7? Wait, 4-4=0, which is divisible by7? Yes, because 0 is divisible by any number.Wait, hold on. 2^2 -2^2=0, which is divisible by7. So, n=2 is a solution.Similarly, n=4:2^4=16, 4^2=16, 16-16=0, which is divisible by7.n=5:2^5=32, 5^2=25, 32-25=7, which is divisible by7.n=6:2^6=64, 6^2=36, 64-36=28, which is divisible by7.n=10:2^10=1024, 10^2=100, 1024-100=924. 924 ÷7=132, so yes, divisible by7.n=15:2^15=32768, 15^2=225, 32768 -225=32543. 32543 ÷7=4649, so yes, divisible by7.So, all these n satisfy the condition. So, our initial analysis is correct.Therefore, in each block of21 numbers, there are6 solutions.Now, total number of blocks: floor(9999 /21)=476 blocks, since476*21=9996.Each block contributes6 solutions, so476*6=2856.Then, in the remaining numbers from9997 to9999, which are3 numbers, we have one solution:9998.So, total solutions:2856 +1=2857.But wait, let me compute9999 -21*476=9999 -9996=3. So, the last partial block has3 numbers:9997,9998,9999.We saw that only9998 is a solution.Therefore, total solutions:2856 +1=2857.But hold on, let me compute21*476=9996, so n=9996 is included in the 476th block.But n=9996: let's check if it's a solution.n=9996:2^9996 mod7.Since2^3≡1 mod7, so2^9996=(2^3)^3332≡1^3332≡1 mod7.n^2=9996^2 mod7.But9996≡9996 mod7. Let's compute9996 ÷7:7*1428=9996, so9996≡0 mod7.Thus, n^2≡0 mod7.So, 2^n -n^2≡1 -0≡1 mod7, which is not0. So, n=9996 is not a solution.Therefore, in the 476th block, the last number is9996, which is not a solution, so the 476 blocks contribute2856 solutions, and then the last partial block contributes1 solution:9998.Hence, total solutions:2857.But wait, let me check n=21*476 +2=9996 +2=9998, which is indeed a solution.So, yes, total solutions:2857.But wait, hold on, let me make sure that in each block, the numbers are correctly counted.Each block of21 numbers has exactly6 solutions, right? So, from1 to21, we have6 solutions:2,4,5,6,10,15.From22 to42, the solutions would be22+2=24,22+4=26,22+5=27,22+6=28,22+10=32,22+15=37.Wait, but24 mod21=3, which is not in our list. Wait, no, wait, no, n=24:24 mod21=3, but in our earlier analysis, solutions are n≡2,4,5,6,10,15 mod21.Wait, 24 mod21=3, which is not in the list. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.Wait, hold on, no, because n=24:24=21+3, so n=24≡3 mod21, which is not in our solution set. So, n=24 is not a solution.But according to our earlier analysis, in each block, the solutions are n≡2,4,5,6,10,15 mod21, which correspond to n=2,4,5,6,10,15 in the first block, then23,25,26,27,31,36 in the second block, etc.Wait, that seems correct.Wait, n=23:23 mod21=2, which is in the list.n=25:25 mod21=4, which is in the list.n=26:26 mod21=5, which is in the list.n=27:27 mod21=6, which is in the list.n=31:31 mod21=10, which is in the list.n=36:36 mod21=15, which is in the list.So, in the second block, n=23,25,26,27,31,36 are solutions.So, each block of21 numbers contributes6 solutions, regardless of the starting point.Therefore, in the range1 to9996, which is476 blocks, we have476*6=2856 solutions.Then, in the last partial block, from9997 to9999, we have n=9997,9998,9999.As computed earlier, only n=9998 is a solution.Therefore, total solutions:2856 +1=2857.But wait, hold on, let me check n=9998.n=9998: compute2^9998 mod7 and9998^2 mod7.First,2^9998 mod7.Since2^3≡1 mod7, so2^9998=2^(3*3332 + 2)= (2^3)^3332 *2^2≡1^3332 *4≡4 mod7.n=9998:9998 mod7.Compute9998 ÷7:7*1428=9996, so9998=9996 +2≡2 mod7.Thus, n^2=2^2=4 mod7.Therefore,2^9998 -9998^2≡4 -4≡0 mod7. So, yes, n=9998 is a solution.Therefore, our count is correct.Therefore, the total number of positive integers n less than10,000 such that2^n -n^2 is divisible by7 is2857.Wait, but hold on, let me make sure that in the first block, n=2 is included. Since n must be a positive integer, n=2 is allowed.But let me check n=1:2^1 -1^2=2 -1=1, which is not divisible by7. So, n=1 is not a solution.Similarly, n=3:2^3 -3^2=8 -9=-1≡6 mod7, not0.n=7:2^7=128≡2 mod7, 7^2=49≡0 mod7, so128 -49=79≡79-11*7=79-77=2≡2 mod7, not0.So, n=7 is not a solution, which is consistent with our earlier result.Therefore, our count seems correct.So, the answer is2857.But wait, hold on, let me compute476*6=2856, plus1 is2857.But wait, let me compute476*21=9996. So, n=9996 is included in the476th block, and n=9997,9998,9999 are the next three numbers.So, n=9997:9997 mod21=1, not a solution.n=9998:9998 mod21=2, which is a solution.n=9999:9999 mod21=3, not a solution.Therefore, only n=9998 is a solution in the last partial block.Thus, total solutions:2856 +1=2857.Therefore, the final answer is2857.But wait, hold on, let me check if n=0 is considered. But the problem says positive integers, so n starts at1. So, n=0 is excluded.Therefore, our count is correct.So, I think I've considered all cases and checked the edge cases. So, the number of positive integers n less than10,000 such that2^n -n^2 is divisible by7 is2857.**Final Answer**The number of positive integers ( n ) less than ( 10^4 ) such that ( 2^n - n^2 ) is divisible by 7 is (boxed{2857})."},{"question":"Given a set A that satisfies the condition: when p in A, it always holds that frac{-1}{p+1} in A (p neq 0 and p neq -1). It is known that 2 in A, then the number of subsets of set A is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a set A, and it has a certain condition. The condition is that if any element p is in A, then -1/(p + 1) must also be in A, as long as p isn't 0 or -1. They also told me that 2 is in A, and I need to find the number of subsets of set A. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand what this condition implies. So, if 2 is in A, then according to the condition, -1/(2 + 1) should also be in A. Let me compute that: -1 divided by (2 + 1) is -1/3. So, -1/3 is in A. Now, since -1/3 is in A, applying the same condition, we need to find -1/(-1/3 + 1). Let me calculate that denominator first: -1/3 + 1 is the same as 2/3. So, -1 divided by (2/3) is -3/2. So, -3/2 is also in A.Alright, so now we have 2, -1/3, and -3/2 in A. Let's continue this process. Taking -3/2, we apply the condition again: -1/(-3/2 + 1). Let's compute the denominator: -3/2 + 1 is -1/2. So, -1 divided by (-1/2) is 2. Wait, that's interesting. So, we end up back at 2.So, it seems like we have a cycle here: 2 leads to -1/3, which leads to -3/2, which leads back to 2. So, this forms a loop. Therefore, the elements in set A are just these three: 2, -1/3, and -3/2. Is that right? Let me double-check.Starting with 2: -1/(2 + 1) = -1/3. Then, starting with -1/3: -1/(-1/3 + 1) = -1/(2/3) = -3/2. Then, starting with -3/2: -1/(-3/2 + 1) = -1/(-1/2) = 2. Yep, so it cycles back. So, the set A must contain these three elements. There's no other element outside of this cycle because starting from 2, we only get these three, and applying the condition again just cycles back.Wait, but the problem says \\"when p is in A, it always holds that -1/(p + 1) is in A.\\" So, does that mean that A could potentially have more elements? Or is it that A must be exactly these three elements? Hmm, I think it's the latter because if you start with 2, you have to include -1/3, which forces you to include -3/2, which forces you back to 2. So, unless there are other starting points, but since the only given element is 2, I think A is exactly {2, -1/3, -3/2}.Therefore, set A has three elements. The number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n. So, in this case, n is 3, so the number of subsets should be 2^3, which is 8.Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that A could have more elements? For example, if we consider that maybe A could have other elements not connected to 2? But the problem says that when p is in A, then -1/(p + 1) is also in A. So, if A had another element, say q, not connected to 2, then it would have to include -1/(q + 1), and so on. But since the only given element is 2, I think A is minimal, meaning it only contains the elements generated by starting with 2 and applying the condition repeatedly until we cycle back.Therefore, A is exactly {2, -1/3, -3/2}, so it has three elements, and the number of subsets is 8.But wait, hold on a second. The problem says \\"when p is in A, it always holds that -1/(p + 1) is in A.\\" So, does that mean that A must contain all such elements, but could also contain others? Or is A exactly the set generated by starting with 2 and applying the condition?I think it's the former. The problem says \\"when p is in A, it always holds that -1/(p + 1) is in A.\\" So, A must contain all such elements, but it can also contain other elements as well. But in this case, since we are given that 2 is in A, and we don't have any other information, the minimal such set A is {2, -1/3, -3/2}. But the problem doesn't specify that A is minimal; it just says that A satisfies the condition and 2 is in A. So, A could be larger.Wait, that complicates things. If A could be larger, then the number of subsets could be infinite, but the problem is asking for the number of subsets, which is a finite number. So, that suggests that A must be finite. Therefore, A is exactly {2, -1/3, -3/2}, because otherwise, if A had more elements, it might not be finite, but since the number of subsets is finite, A must be finite.Alternatively, maybe the condition forces A to be exactly those three elements. Let me think.Suppose A is a set where for every p in A, -1/(p + 1) is also in A. If A contains 2, then it must contain -1/3, which forces it to contain -3/2, which forces it back to 2. So, if A is closed under this operation, it must contain these three elements. But could it contain more? If A contains another element, say q, not equal to 2, -1/3, or -3/2, then it must also contain -1/(q + 1), and so on. But unless q is part of another cycle, this could lead to an infinite set.But the problem is asking for the number of subsets, which is finite. Therefore, A must be finite. So, the only way for A to be finite is if it's exactly the three elements we found, because otherwise, if you add another element, you might have to add infinitely many more.Therefore, A must be {2, -1/3, -3/2}, so it has three elements, and the number of subsets is 2^3 = 8.Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Suppose A is allowed to be any set that includes these three elements and possibly others, but the problem is that if you include others, you might have to include more elements, potentially infinitely many. But since the problem is asking for the number of subsets, which is finite, it must be that A is exactly those three elements. Otherwise, the number of subsets would be infinite.Therefore, I think A is exactly {2, -1/3, -3/2}, so the number of subsets is 8.But just to make sure, let me consider if A could have more elements without causing an infinite set. Suppose A has another element, say 1. Then, according to the condition, -1/(1 + 1) = -1/2 must be in A. Then, starting from -1/2, -1/(-1/2 + 1) = -1/(1/2) = -2 must be in A. Then, starting from -2, -1/(-2 + 1) = -1/(-1) = 1 must be in A. So, we have a cycle: 1 leads to -1/2, which leads to -2, which leads back to 1. So, that's another cycle.But in the original problem, we were only told that 2 is in A. So, unless A is required to include all such cycles, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says that when p is in A, then -1/(p + 1) is in A. So, if A contains 2, it must contain -1/3 and -3/2, but it doesn't necessarily have to contain 1 or -1/2 or -2 unless they are generated by starting from 2.But starting from 2, we only get the cycle {2, -1/3, -3/2}, so unless A is required to be the minimal set, but the problem doesn't specify minimality. It just says that A satisfies the condition and 2 is in A. So, A could be the union of multiple such cycles, but since we don't have any other starting points, the minimal A is just the cycle starting from 2.But since the problem is asking for the number of subsets, which is finite, it must be that A is finite, so A must be exactly the three elements. Otherwise, if A had more elements, it might be infinite, leading to an infinite number of subsets, which isn't the case here.Therefore, I think the answer is 8 subsets.Wait, but hold on. Let me think about this again. If A is exactly {2, -1/3, -3/2}, then the number of subsets is 2^3 = 8. But if A could be larger, the number of subsets would be larger. But since the problem is asking for the number of subsets, and it's expecting a finite number, it must be that A is exactly those three elements.Alternatively, maybe the problem is implying that A is the minimal such set, so it's exactly those three elements. So, yeah, I think it's safe to say that A has three elements, so the number of subsets is 8.Wait, but let me check if there are any other elements that must be in A. For example, starting from 2, we get -1/3, then from -1/3, we get -3/2, and from -3/2, we get back to 2. So, that's a cycle of length 3. There's no other element generated outside of this cycle, right? So, unless A is allowed to have other elements not connected to this cycle, but since the problem doesn't specify any other elements, and given that 2 is in A, the minimal A is just these three elements.Therefore, I think the answer is 8.**Final Answer**The number of subsets of set ( A ) is boxed{8}."},{"question":"How many turns are needed to wind a 90 mathrm{~m} long tape with a thickness of 0.018 mathrm{~mm} onto an empty reel with a diameter of 22 mathrm{~mm}?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many turns are needed to wind a 90-meter-long tape onto an empty reel. The tape is 0.018 mm thick, and the reel has a diameter of 22 mm. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I should probably convert all the measurements to the same unit to avoid confusion. The tape length is given in meters, the thickness in millimeters, and the reel diameter also in millimeters. Let me convert the tape length from meters to millimeters because the other measurements are in millimeters. Since 1 meter is 1000 millimeters, 90 meters would be 90 * 1000 = 90,000 millimeters. Okay, so the tape is 90,000 mm long. The thickness is 0.018 mm, which is pretty thin, and the reel's diameter is 22 mm, so the radius is half of that, which is 11 mm. Now, when you wind tape onto a reel, each turn adds to the radius. The first turn will have a radius equal to the reel's radius, which is 11 mm. The next turn will have a radius of 11 mm plus the thickness of the tape, which is 0.018 mm, so 11.018 mm. The third turn would be 11.036 mm, and so on. Each subsequent turn increases the radius by 0.018 mm.This seems like a problem where the radius increases linearly with each turn. So, the length of each turn is the circumference of the circle at that radius. The circumference is given by 2 * π * radius. So, each turn's length is 2 * π * r, where r is the radius at that turn.Since each turn increases the radius by 0.018 mm, the radii form an arithmetic sequence: r1 = 11 mm, r2 = 11.018 mm, r3 = 11.036 mm, etc. The length of each turn is then 2πr1, 2πr2, 2πr3, etc. So, the total length of the tape is the sum of all these circumferences.So, the total length L is the sum from n=1 to N of 2πr_n, where r_n = 11 + (n-1)*0.018. That simplifies to L = 2π * sum from n=1 to N of [11 + (n-1)*0.018].Let me write that sum out. The sum is an arithmetic series where the first term a1 = 11, the common difference d = 0.018, and the number of terms is N. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = N/2 * [2a1 + (N - 1)d]. So, substituting that in, we get:L = 2π * [N/2 * (2*11 + (N - 1)*0.018)]Simplify that:L = 2π * [N/2 * (22 + 0.018N - 0.018)]Simplify inside the brackets:22 - 0.018 = 21.982So, L = 2π * [N/2 * (21.982 + 0.018N)]Multiply 2π with N/2:2π * N/2 = πNSo, L = πN * (21.982 + 0.018N)Which can be written as:L = πN * (21.982 + 0.018N)We know that L is 90,000 mm, so:90,000 = πN * (21.982 + 0.018N)Hmm, this is a quadratic equation in terms of N. Let me write it as:0.018πN² + 21.982πN - 90,000 = 0Let me compute the coefficients:First, 0.018π is approximately 0.018 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.056548Then, 21.982π is approximately 21.982 * 3.1416 ≈ 69.006So, the equation becomes:0.056548N² + 69.006N - 90,000 = 0This is a quadratic equation of the form aN² + bN + c = 0, where:a = 0.056548b = 69.006c = -90,000We can solve for N using the quadratic formula:N = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)Let me compute the discriminant first:D = b² - 4acCompute b²: 69.006² ≈ 4761.972Compute 4ac: 4 * 0.056548 * (-90,000) ≈ 4 * 0.056548 * (-90,000) ≈ 4 * (-5089.32) ≈ -20,357.28So, D = 4761.972 - (-20,357.28) = 4761.972 + 20,357.28 ≈ 25,119.252Now, sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(25,119.252) ≈ 158.48So, N = [-69.006 ± 158.48] / (2 * 0.056548)We can ignore the negative solution because the number of turns can't be negative, so:N = (-69.006 + 158.48) / (0.113096)Compute numerator: -69.006 + 158.48 ≈ 89.474So, N ≈ 89.474 / 0.113096 ≈ 790.5Since we can't have a fraction of a turn, we'll round up to the next whole number, so N ≈ 791 turns.Wait, let me double-check my calculations because 791 seems a bit high. Let me verify each step.First, converting 90 meters to millimeters: 90 * 1000 = 90,000 mm. That seems correct.Reel diameter is 22 mm, so radius is 11 mm. Thickness is 0.018 mm per layer. So, each turn increases the radius by 0.018 mm.The formula for the total length is the sum of circumferences, which is 2π times the sum of radii. The radii form an arithmetic sequence starting at 11 mm, with a common difference of 0.018 mm.Sum of radii is N/2 * [2*11 + (N - 1)*0.018]. So, total length is 2π*(N/2)*(22 + 0.018*(N - 1)) = π*N*(22 + 0.018*(N - 1)). Which simplifies to π*N*(21.982 + 0.018N). So, that seems correct.Setting that equal to 90,000 mm:π*N*(21.982 + 0.018N) = 90,000Which becomes 0.018πN² + 21.982πN - 90,000 = 0Calculating coefficients:0.018π ≈ 0.05654821.982π ≈ 69.006So, equation: 0.056548N² + 69.006N - 90,000 = 0Quadratic formula:N = [-69.006 ± sqrt(69.006² - 4*0.056548*(-90,000))]/(2*0.056548)Compute discriminant:69.006² ≈ 4761.9724*0.056548*90,000 ≈ 4*0.056548*90,000 ≈ 4*5089.32 ≈ 20,357.28So, discriminant D ≈ 4761.972 + 20,357.28 ≈ 25,119.252sqrt(D) ≈ 158.48So, N ≈ (-69.006 + 158.48)/(2*0.056548) ≈ 89.474 / 0.113096 ≈ 790.5Rounded up to 791 turns. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think about another approach. Maybe using the formula for the length of a spiral. The length of a spiral can be approximated by integrating the circumference as the radius increases. But since the thickness is small, the arithmetic series approach should be a good approximation.Alternatively, the formula for the number of turns can be approximated by:N ≈ (L) / (π*(D + N*t)/2)But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, another formula is:N = (L)/(π*(D/2 + N*t))But that's also a bit circular. Maybe it's better to stick with the quadratic equation.Wait, but let me think about the initial assumption. Each turn adds 0.018 mm to the radius, so the first turn is 11 mm, the second 11.018 mm, etc. So, the average radius over N turns would be (11 + (11 + 0.018*(N-1)))/2 = 11 + 0.009*(N-1). So, the average circumference is 2π*(11 + 0.009*(N-1)). Then, total length L ≈ average circumference * number of turns.So, L ≈ 2π*(11 + 0.009*(N-1)) * NWhich is similar to what we had before. So, 90,000 ≈ 2π*(11 + 0.009N - 0.009) * NSimplify: 90,000 ≈ 2π*(10.991 + 0.009N) * NWhich is 90,000 ≈ 2π*(10.991N + 0.009N²)Which is 90,000 ≈ 21.982πN + 0.018πN²Which is the same quadratic equation as before. So, same result.Therefore, N ≈ 791 turns.But let me check if 791 turns would give exactly 90,000 mm.Compute L = π*N*(21.982 + 0.018N)Plug in N = 791:L = π*791*(21.982 + 0.018*791)Compute 0.018*791 ≈ 14.238So, 21.982 + 14.238 ≈ 36.22So, L ≈ π*791*36.22 ≈ 3.1416*791*36.22First, compute 791*36.22:791 * 36 = 28,476791 * 0.22 ≈ 174.02Total ≈ 28,476 + 174.02 ≈ 28,650.02Then, multiply by π: 28,650.02 * 3.1416 ≈ 28,650.02 * 3 ≈ 85,950.06, plus 28,650.02 * 0.1416 ≈ 4,056. So, total ≈ 85,950 + 4,056 ≈ 90,006 mm.Wow, that's very close to 90,000 mm. So, N = 791 gives approximately 90,006 mm, which is just a bit over. So, maybe 790 turns would give slightly less.Let me compute for N = 790:L = π*790*(21.982 + 0.018*790)0.018*790 ≈ 14.2221.982 + 14.22 ≈ 36.202L ≈ π*790*36.202 ≈ 3.1416*790*36.202Compute 790*36.202:790 * 36 = 28,440790 * 0.202 ≈ 159.58Total ≈ 28,440 + 159.58 ≈ 28,599.58Multiply by π: 28,599.58 * 3.1416 ≈ 28,599.58 * 3 ≈ 85,798.74, plus 28,599.58 * 0.1416 ≈ 4,046. So, total ≈ 85,798.74 + 4,046 ≈ 89,844.74 mm.So, 790 turns give approximately 89,844.74 mm, which is about 155 mm short of 90,000 mm. So, 791 turns give about 90,006 mm, which is just 6 mm over. So, practically, 791 turns would be sufficient.But since we can't have a fraction of a turn, and 790 is insufficient, we need 791 turns.Alternatively, maybe we can use a more precise calculation without approximating π as 3.1416.Let me compute the discriminant more accurately.D = b² - 4acb = 69.006a = 0.056548c = -90,000So, b² = 69.006²Compute 69² = 47610.006² = 0.000036Cross term: 2*69*0.006 = 0.828So, (69.006)² = 4761 + 0.828 + 0.000036 ≈ 4761.8280364ac = 4 * 0.056548 * (-90,000) = 4 * (-5089.32) = -20,357.28So, D = 4761.828036 - (-20,357.28) = 4761.828036 + 20,357.28 ≈ 25,119.108036sqrt(D) = sqrt(25,119.108036). Let's compute this more accurately.We know that 158² = 24,964159² = 25,281So, sqrt(25,119.108) is between 158 and 159.Compute 158.5² = (158 + 0.5)² = 158² + 2*158*0.5 + 0.5² = 24,964 + 158 + 0.25 = 25,122.25Which is higher than 25,119.108.So, sqrt(25,119.108) ≈ 158.5 - (25,122.25 - 25,119.108)/(2*158.5)Difference: 25,122.25 - 25,119.108 = 3.142So, approximate sqrt ≈ 158.5 - 3.142/(2*158.5) ≈ 158.5 - 3.142/317 ≈ 158.5 - 0.0099 ≈ 158.4901So, sqrt(D) ≈ 158.4901So, N = (-69.006 + 158.4901)/(2*0.056548) ≈ (89.4841)/(0.113096) ≈ 790.5So, N ≈ 790.5, which rounds up to 791.Therefore, the number of turns needed is 791.But just to be thorough, let me check the exact value without approximating π.Let me write the quadratic equation again:0.018πN² + 21.982πN - 90,000 = 0Let me factor out π:π*(0.018N² + 21.982N) - 90,000 = 0But that might not help much. Alternatively, let me compute the exact value of N.Using the quadratic formula:N = [-b + sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)Where:a = 0.018πb = 21.982πc = -90,000So,N = [-21.982π + sqrt((21.982π)² - 4*0.018π*(-90,000))]/(2*0.018π)Simplify numerator:First, compute (21.982π)²:21.982² = approx 483.208So, (21.982π)² ≈ 483.208 * π² ≈ 483.208 * 9.8696 ≈ 483.208 * 10 ≈ 4,832.08 (approx)But more accurately:483.208 * 9.8696 ≈ 483.208 * 9 = 4,348.872483.208 * 0.8696 ≈ 483.208 * 0.8 = 386.5664483.208 * 0.0696 ≈ 33.64So, total ≈ 4,348.872 + 386.5664 + 33.64 ≈ 4,769.0784So, (21.982π)² ≈ 4,769.0784Then, compute 4ac:4 * 0.018π * (-90,000) = 4 * 0.018 * (-90,000) * π = 4 * (-1,620) * π ≈ -6,480π ≈ -20,357.52So, discriminant D = 4,769.0784 - (-20,357.52) = 4,769.0784 + 20,357.52 ≈ 25,126.5984sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(25,126.5984). Let's compute this.We know that 158² = 24,964159² = 25,281So, sqrt(25,126.5984) is between 158 and 159.Compute 158.5² = 25,122.25 as before.25,126.5984 - 25,122.25 = 4.3484So, sqrt(25,126.5984) ≈ 158.5 + 4.3484/(2*158.5) ≈ 158.5 + 4.3484/317 ≈ 158.5 + 0.0137 ≈ 158.5137So, sqrt(D) ≈ 158.5137Now, numerator:-21.982π + 158.5137Compute 21.982π ≈ 21.982 * 3.1416 ≈ 69.006So, numerator ≈ -69.006 + 158.5137 ≈ 89.5077Denominator: 2 * 0.018π ≈ 0.036π ≈ 0.113097So, N ≈ 89.5077 / 0.113097 ≈ 790.5Again, same result. So, N ≈ 790.5, which rounds up to 791.Therefore, the number of turns needed is 791.I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways, and each time it comes out to approximately 790.5, which we round up to 791 turns. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.**Final Answer**The number of turns needed is boxed{791}."},{"question":"How many of the first 2018 numbers in the sequence 101, 1001, 10001, 100001, dots are divisible by 101?textbf{(A) }253 qquad textbf{(B) }504 qquad textbf{(C) }505 qquad textbf{(D) }506  qquad textbf{(E) }1009 qquad","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to figure out how many of the first 2018 numbers in the sequence 101, 1001, 10001, 100001, ... are divisible by 101. The options are A) 253, B) 504, C) 505, D) 506, E) 1009. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand the sequence. The first term is 101, the second is 1001, the third is 10001, and so on. It looks like each term has one more zero than the previous term. So, the nth term can be written as 10^n + 1. Let me confirm that:- For n=1: 10^1 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11. Wait, that's not 101. Hmm, maybe it's 10^(n+1) + 1?Let me check:- For n=1: 10^(2) + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101. That works.- For n=2: 10^3 + 1 = 1000 + 1 = 1001. Perfect.- For n=3: 10^4 + 1 = 10000 + 1 = 10001. Yep, that's the sequence.So, the general term is a_n = 10^(n+1) + 1. Got it.Now, the question is asking how many of the first 2018 numbers in this sequence are divisible by 101. So, I need to find the number of integers n between 1 and 2018 such that a_n is divisible by 101, i.e., 10^(n+1) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 101.Let me write that congruence:10^(n+1) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 101Which simplifies to:10^(n+1) ≡ -1 mod 101So, 10^(n+1) ≡ -1 mod 101.I need to find all n in 1 ≤ n ≤ 2018 such that 10^(n+1) ≡ -1 mod 101.Hmm, okay. So, perhaps I can find the order of 10 modulo 101, which would help me figure out the periodicity of 10^k mod 101.First, let's recall that 101 is a prime number. That might be helpful because of Fermat's little theorem, which says that 10^(100) ≡ 1 mod 101, since 101 is prime and 10 is not a multiple of 101.So, the order of 10 modulo 101 divides 100. Let me find the order.The order is the smallest positive integer d such that 10^d ≡ 1 mod 101.Let me check the divisors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.Compute 10^d mod 101 for these d until I find the smallest one that gives 1.Start with d=1: 10^1 = 10 mod 101 ≠ 1.d=2: 10^2 = 100 mod 101. 100 ≡ -1 mod 101. So, 10^2 ≡ -1 mod 101.d=4: (10^2)^2 ≡ (-1)^2 = 1 mod 101. So, 10^4 ≡ 1 mod 101.Therefore, the order of 10 modulo 101 is 4. So, 10^4 ≡ 1 mod 101, and 4 is the smallest such exponent.So, the powers of 10 modulo 101 cycle every 4 exponents. So, 10^1 ≡ 10, 10^2 ≡ -1, 10^3 ≡ -10, 10^4 ≡ 1, 10^5 ≡ 10, etc.So, the cycle is 10, -1, -10, 1, 10, -1, -10, 1, ...So, now, going back to our original congruence: 10^(n+1) ≡ -1 mod 101.Looking at the cycle, 10^k ≡ -1 mod 101 when k ≡ 2 mod 4. Because 10^2 ≡ -1, 10^6 ≡ -1, 10^10 ≡ -1, etc.Therefore, 10^(n+1) ≡ -1 mod 101 implies that n+1 ≡ 2 mod 4.So, n+1 ≡ 2 mod 4 => n ≡ 1 mod 4.Therefore, n must be congruent to 1 modulo 4.So, the numbers n in 1 ≤ n ≤ 2018 where n ≡ 1 mod 4 will satisfy the condition.So, how many such numbers are there?Well, the numbers are 1, 5, 9, ..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 2018 that is congruent to 1 mod 4.Let me find the number of terms in this arithmetic progression.The first term is 1, the common difference is 4, and the last term is the largest number ≤2018 such that term ≡1 mod4.Let me compute the last term.2018 divided by 4: 2018 ÷4=504.5. So, 4×504=2016. So, 2016 is divisible by 4, so 2016 ≡0 mod4. Therefore, 2016 +1=2017≡1 mod4.So, the last term is 2017.Thus, the number of terms is given by:Number of terms = ((Last term - First term)/Common difference) +1So, ((2017 -1)/4)+1 = (2016/4)+1=504 +1=505.Wait, so that would be 505 terms.But hold on, let me double-check.Wait, 2017 is the last term, which is 1 mod4. So, starting from 1, each term increases by 4, so the number of terms is floor((2018 -1)/4) +1.Wait, 2018-1=2017. 2017 divided by4 is 504.25, so floor(504.25)=504. Then, 504 +1=505.Yes, so 505 terms.But wait, let me make sure that 2017 is indeed ≤2018. Yes, 2017 is less than 2018, so that's fine.Therefore, the number of terms is 505.Looking back at the options, C is 505. So, is that the answer?Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the reasoning.So, the key steps:1. The nth term is 10^(n+1)+1.2. We need 10^(n+1)+1 ≡0 mod101, which simplifies to 10^(n+1)≡-1 mod101.3. The order of 10 modulo101 is 4, so 10^4≡1 mod101.4. Therefore, 10^(n+1)≡-1 mod101 implies n+1≡2 mod4, so n≡1 mod4.5. Therefore, n=1,5,9,...,2017.6. Number of terms is ((2017-1)/4)+1=505.So, that seems correct.But wait, let me check with n=1: 10^(2)+1=100+1=101, which is divisible by101. Correct.n=5: 10^(6)+1=1000000+1=1000001. Is that divisible by101?Let me check: 1000001 ÷101. 101×9900=999900. 1000001-999900=101. So, 101×9901=1000001. So, yes, divisible by101.Similarly, n=9: 10^10 +1. Let me see, 10^10=10000000000. 10000000000 +1=10000000001. Divided by101: 101×99009901=10000000001. So, yes, divisible.So, seems like the reasoning is correct.Therefore, the number of such n is 505, which is option C.Wait, but hold on, the options are A)253, B)504, C)505, D)506, E)1009.So, 505 is an option, so I think that's the answer.But just to make sure, let me think about the cycle again.Since the order is 4, the exponents cycle every 4. So, in each block of 4 consecutive exponents, only one exponent k will satisfy 10^k ≡-1 mod101, which is when k≡2 mod4.Therefore, in the exponents from 2 to 2019 (since n+1 goes up to 2018+1=2019), how many exponents k satisfy k≡2 mod4.So, the exponents k=2,6,10,..., up to the largest k ≤2019 with k≡2 mod4.Compute the number of such k.First term:2, last term: Let's see, 2019 divided by4: 2019=4×504 +3. So, 4×504=2016, so 2016 +2=2018. So, the last term is 2018.Wait, 2018≡2 mod4. So, the last term is 2018.So, number of terms is ((2018 -2)/4)+1= (2016/4)+1=504 +1=505.Wait, so same result.Therefore, 505 terms.So, that's consistent.Therefore, the answer is 505, which is option C.Wait, but hold on, the problem says \\"the first 2018 numbers in the sequence\\". So, n ranges from1 to2018. So, n+1 ranges from2 to2019.But when we count the number of k= n+1 with k≡2 mod4, from2 to2019, inclusive, we get 505 terms.So, that's correct.But just to make sure, let me compute 2018 divided by4: 2018=4×504 +2. So, 504 full cycles, each contributing 1 term, and then 2 extra terms.But in the last partial cycle, since we're starting at k=2, which is the first term of the cycle, and we have 2 extra terms, which would be k=2 and k=3. But since we only need k≡2 mod4, only k=2 is counted in the extra terms.Therefore, total terms:504×1 +1=505.Yes, that's consistent.Therefore, the answer is 505, which is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Given that ( x_1, x_2, x_3, cdots, x_{1989}, x_{1990} ) are 1990 positive numbers, and[ frac{1}{1+x_1} + frac{1}{1+x_2} + frac{1}{1+x_3} + cdots + frac{1}{1+x_{1989}} + frac{1}{1+x_{1990}} = 1, ]which of the following statements is true for these 1990 positive numbers?(A) There is at most one number less than 1.(B) There is definitely a number greater than 1989.(C) There is definitely a number less than 1989.(D) There is definitely a number equal to 1990.(High School Mathematics Competition, Beijing, China, 1990)","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here from a Chinese high school competition. It involves 1990 positive numbers, ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{1990} ), and a condition on their reciprocals:[frac{1}{1+x_1} + frac{1}{1+x_2} + cdots + frac{1}{1+x_{1990}} = 1]And I need to figure out which of the statements (A) through (D) is necessarily true. Let me go through each option one by one, but first, maybe I should understand the given condition better.So, the sum of these reciprocals equals 1. Each term is of the form ( frac{1}{1+x_i} ), and since all ( x_i ) are positive, each term is less than 1. Also, each term is positive because ( x_i ) is positive. So, the sum of 1990 positive terms, each less than 1, equals exactly 1.Hmm, interesting. So, if all the ( x_i ) were very large, each ( frac{1}{1+x_i} ) would be very small, and the sum would be less than 1. On the other hand, if some ( x_i ) are small, their reciprocals would be larger, contributing more to the sum.Wait, so if we have too many small ( x_i ), the sum could exceed 1, but since the sum is exactly 1, there must be a balance. Maybe if some ( x_i ) are small, others must be large to compensate?Let me think about the extremes. Suppose all ( x_i ) are equal. Let's say each ( x_i = k ). Then, the sum would be ( 1990 times frac{1}{1+k} = 1 ). Solving for ( k ), we get ( frac{1990}{1+k} = 1 ), so ( 1 + k = 1990 ), hence ( k = 1989 ). So, if all ( x_i ) are equal, each is 1989. But the problem doesn't say they are equal, just that they are positive.So, in the case where all are equal, each is 1989. But if some are larger, others must be smaller to keep the sum at 1. So, if one ( x_i ) is larger than 1989, another must be smaller than 1989. Similarly, if one is smaller, another must be larger.Wait, but the options are about numbers less than 1, greater than 1989, etc. So, let me analyze each option.Option (A): There is at most one number less than 1.Hmm. So, is it possible to have more than one number less than 1? Let's see.Suppose two numbers are less than 1, say ( x_1 = x_2 = 0.5 ). Then, ( frac{1}{1+0.5} = frac{2}{3} ) each. So, two of them would contribute ( frac{4}{3} ), which is already more than 1. But the total sum is supposed to be 1. So, that's a problem. So, if two numbers are less than 1, their reciprocals would add up to more than 1, which is impossible because the total sum is exactly 1. Therefore, we can have at most one number less than 1. So, Option (A) is true.Wait, but let me check this reasoning. If two numbers are less than 1, say ( x_1 = x_2 = 0.9 ), then each term is ( frac{1}{1.9} approx 0.526 ). So, two of them would be approximately 1.052, which is more than 1. So, even if they are just slightly less than 1, their reciprocals add up to more than 1, which is not allowed. Therefore, you can't have two numbers less than 1 because their contributions would exceed the total sum of 1. So, Option (A) is correct.But wait, what if the other terms compensate? For example, if two ( x_i ) are less than 1, making their reciprocals larger, but the rest are very large, making their reciprocals very small. But let's see.Suppose two ( x_i ) are 0.5, contributing ( frac{2}{3} ) each, so total of ( frac{4}{3} ). Then, the remaining 1988 terms would have to sum to ( 1 - frac{4}{3} = -frac{1}{3} ), which is impossible because all terms are positive. Therefore, it's impossible to have two numbers less than 1. So, at most one number can be less than 1. So, (A) is correct.But let me hold on a second. What if the two numbers are not 0.5, but something else? Let's say ( x_1 = x_2 = a ), where ( a < 1 ). Then, each term is ( frac{1}{1+a} ). The sum of these two terms is ( frac{2}{1+a} ). The remaining 1988 terms must sum to ( 1 - frac{2}{1+a} ).But since each ( x_i ) is positive, each of the remaining terms is less than 1. So, the maximum sum of the remaining terms is less than 1988 * 1 = 1988, but we need the remaining sum to be ( 1 - frac{2}{1+a} ). Let's see if that's possible.Wait, ( 1 - frac{2}{1+a} ) must be positive because all terms are positive. So,( 1 - frac{2}{1+a} > 0 implies frac{2}{1+a} < 1 implies 2 < 1 + a implies a > 1 ).But ( a < 1 ) by assumption. So, ( 1 - frac{2}{1+a} ) would be negative, which is impossible because the sum of positive terms can't be negative. Therefore, it's impossible to have two numbers less than 1. So, Option (A) is indeed correct.But let me check the other options just to be thorough.Option (B): There is definitely a number greater than 1989.Hmm. So, does at least one ( x_i ) have to be greater than 1989?Well, let's think about the case where all ( x_i ) are equal. As we saw earlier, each would be 1989. So, in that case, none are greater than 1989, but all are equal to 1989. So, that would mean that it's possible that none are greater than 1989. Therefore, Option (B) is not necessarily true.Wait, but hold on. If all ( x_i ) are equal to 1989, then each term is ( frac{1}{1990} ), and 1990 of them sum to 1. So, in that case, no number is greater than 1989. So, it's possible that all numbers are exactly 1989, so Option (B) is not necessarily true. So, (B) is false.Option (C): There is definitely a number less than 1989.Hmm. So, does at least one ( x_i ) have to be less than 1989?Well, in the case where all ( x_i ) are equal to 1989, none are less than 1989. So, similar to Option (B), it's possible that all are equal to 1989, so there isn't necessarily a number less than 1989. So, Option (C) is not necessarily true. So, (C) is false.Option (D): There is definitely a number equal to 1990.Hmm. So, does at least one ( x_i ) have to be exactly 1990?Well, let's see. Suppose all ( x_i ) are 1989. Then, each term is ( frac{1}{1990} ), and 1990 of them sum to 1. So, in that case, none of the ( x_i ) are equal to 1990. So, it's possible that none are equal to 1990. Therefore, Option (D) is not necessarily true. So, (D) is false.Wait, but hold on. Maybe if one ( x_i ) is 1990, then ( frac{1}{1+1990} = frac{1}{1991} ), which is slightly less than ( frac{1}{1990} ). So, if one ( x_i ) is 1990, the total sum would be slightly less than 1, but we need the sum to be exactly 1. So, perhaps adjusting other terms could compensate? Hmm, but in the case where all are 1989, the sum is exactly 1. So, in that case, none are 1990. So, it's possible to have all ( x_i ) equal to 1989, so (D) is not necessarily true.Therefore, among the options, only (A) is necessarily true.But wait, just to make sure, let me think about whether (B) could be true in some cases, but not necessarily always. So, for example, if one ( x_i ) is very large, say approaching infinity, then ( frac{1}{1+x_i} ) approaches 0. Then, the other 1989 terms would have to sum to 1. If all other ( x_i ) are equal, then each would be ( frac{1}{1989} ), so ( x_j = frac{1}{1989} - 1 ). Wait, but ( frac{1}{1+x_j} = frac{1}{1989} implies 1 + x_j = 1989 implies x_j = 1988 ). So, in this case, one ( x_i ) is very large, and the others are 1988. So, in this case, there is definitely a number greater than 1989 (the very large one). But in the case where all are 1989, there isn't. So, sometimes you have a number greater than 1989, but not necessarily always. So, (B) is not necessarily true.Similarly, for (C), if all are 1989, none are less than 1989, so (C) is not necessarily true.And for (D), as we saw, it's possible to have all equal to 1989, so none are equal to 1990. So, (D) is not necessarily true.Therefore, only (A) is necessarily true.Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about another scenario. Suppose one ( x_i ) is less than 1, say ( x_1 = 0.5 ), then ( frac{1}{1+0.5} = frac{2}{3} ). Then, the remaining 1989 terms must sum to ( 1 - frac{2}{3} = frac{1}{3} ). So, each of the remaining terms would have to be ( frac{1}{3 times 1989} approx frac{1}{5967} ). So, each ( x_j ) for ( j geq 2 ) would be ( frac{1}{frac{1}{5967}} - 1 = 5966 ). So, in this case, one number is less than 1, and the rest are 5966, which is greater than 1989. So, in this case, both (A) is true (only one less than 1), and (B) is also true (many greater than 1989). But in the case where all are 1989, (B) is false. So, (B) is not necessarily true.Similarly, if I have one number less than 1, others can be greater than 1989, but it's not required. Wait, no, in the case where all are 1989, none are less than 1, so (A) is still true because it's at most one, but in that case, zero numbers are less than 1, which is still \\"at most one\\". So, (A) is always true.Wait, but in the case where all are 1989, how many numbers are less than 1? Zero. So, \\"at most one\\" is still satisfied because zero is less than or equal to one. So, (A) is always true.But let me think again. Suppose one number is less than 1, say ( x_1 = 0.5 ), then the others have to compensate by being larger. So, in that case, you have one number less than 1, and others greater than 1989, as we saw. So, in that case, (B) is true, but in the case where all are 1989, (B) is false. So, (B) is not necessarily true.Similarly, if I have one number less than 1, then the others have to be greater than 1989, but if I have zero numbers less than 1, then all can be equal to 1989. So, (A) is always true because you can't have more than one less than 1, but you can have zero or one.So, yeah, I think (A) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"The price of a yogurt is 120 yuan, and the price of a set of clothes is 6 times that of the yogurt.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1. So, I need to find the slopes of both lines l₁ and l₂, and then set up an equation where their product equals -1. That should help me solve for 'a'.Starting with line l₂: x + 2y = 0. I need to find its slope. To do that, I can rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.So, let's rearrange l₂: x + 2y = 0.Subtract x from both sides: 2y = -x.Now, divide both sides by 2: y = (-1/2)x + 0.So, the slope (m₂) of line l₂ is -1/2.Alright, now moving on to line l₁: 2x - a y - 1 = 0. I'll do the same thing, convert it into slope-intercept form to find its slope.Starting with 2x - a y - 1 = 0.Let me rearrange this equation to solve for y.First, subtract 2x and add 1 to both sides: -a y = -2x + 1.Now, divide both sides by -a: y = (2/a)x - (1/a).So, the slope (m₁) of line l₁ is 2/a.Now, since the two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, m₁ * m₂ = -1.Plugging in the values I found:(2/a) * (-1/2) = -1.Let me compute the left side:(2/a) * (-1/2) = (-2)/(2a) = (-1)/a.So, (-1)/a = -1.Now, I can solve for 'a'.Multiply both sides by 'a' to get rid of the denominator:-1 = -a.Then, multiply both sides by -1:1 = a.So, a = 1.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Converted l₂ to slope-intercept form: y = (-1/2)x. So, slope is -1/2. That seems correct.2. Converted l₁: 2x - a y - 1 = 0 to y = (2/a)x - (1/a). So, slope is 2/a. That looks right.3. Set the product of slopes equal to -1: (2/a)*(-1/2) = -1.4. Simplified: (-1)/a = -1.5. Solved for 'a': a = 1.Hmm, all the steps seem to check out. So, I think a is indeed 1.But just to be thorough, let me plug a = 1 back into l₁ and see if the lines are indeed perpendicular.So, with a = 1, l₁ becomes 2x - y - 1 = 0, which in slope-intercept form is y = 2x - 1. So, slope is 2.And l₂ has a slope of -1/2.Multiplying the slopes: 2 * (-1/2) = -1. Yep, that confirms they are perpendicular.So, I think I did everything correctly. The value of 'a' is 1.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"The difference of two natural numbers, which are perfect squares, ends with the digit 2. What are the last digits of the minuend and the subtrahend, if the last digit of the minuend is greater than the last digit of the subtrahend?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: The difference of two natural numbers, which are perfect squares, ends with the digit 2. I need to find the last digits of the minuend and the subtrahend, given that the last digit of the minuend is greater than the last digit of the subtrahend. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, let's recall what perfect squares are. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc., are perfect squares because they are squares of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. Now, the problem is about the difference between two such numbers ending with 2. So, if I have two perfect squares, say A² and B², then A² - B² ends with the digit 2. Also, the last digit of A² is greater than the last digit of B².My goal is to find the possible last digits of A² and B². Since we're dealing with the last digits, it might be helpful to consider the last digits of perfect squares. I remember that the last digit of a perfect square can only be certain digits. Let me list them out:- 0² = 0- 1² = 1- 2² = 4- 3² = 9- 4² = 16- 5² = 25- 6² = 36- 7² = 49- 8² = 64- 9² = 81So, the possible last digits of perfect squares are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, and also 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, but wait, actually, when considering only the last digit, it's 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9. So, the last digit of a perfect square can only be one of these: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.Now, the difference between two perfect squares ends with 2. So, if I denote the last digit of A² as 'a' and the last digit of B² as 'b', then (a - b) mod 10 should be equal to 2. Also, since the last digit of the minuend is greater than the subtrahend, a > b.So, I need to find pairs (a, b) where a and b are in {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}, a > b, and (a - b) mod 10 = 2.Let me list all possible pairs where a > b and compute (a - b) mod 10:1. a = 9:   - b = 0: 9 - 0 = 9 → 9 mod 10 = 9 ≠ 2   - b = 1: 9 - 1 = 8 → 8 mod 10 = 8 ≠ 2   - b = 4: 9 - 4 = 5 → 5 mod 10 = 5 ≠ 2   - b = 5: 9 - 5 = 4 → 4 mod 10 = 4 ≠ 2   - b = 6: 9 - 6 = 3 → 3 mod 10 = 3 ≠ 22. a = 6:   - b = 0: 6 - 0 = 6 → 6 mod 10 = 6 ≠ 2   - b = 1: 6 - 1 = 5 → 5 mod 10 = 5 ≠ 2   - b = 4: 6 - 4 = 2 → 2 mod 10 = 2 ✅   - b = 5: 6 - 5 = 1 → 1 mod 10 = 1 ≠ 23. a = 5:   - b = 0: 5 - 0 = 5 → 5 mod 10 = 5 ≠ 2   - b = 1: 5 - 1 = 4 → 4 mod 10 = 4 ≠ 2   - b = 4: 5 - 4 = 1 → 1 mod 10 = 1 ≠ 24. a = 4:   - b = 0: 4 - 0 = 4 → 4 mod 10 = 4 ≠ 2   - b = 1: 4 - 1 = 3 → 3 mod 10 = 3 ≠ 25. a = 1:   - b = 0: 1 - 0 = 1 → 1 mod 10 = 1 ≠ 2So, from the above, the only pair that satisfies (a - b) mod 10 = 2 with a > b is when a = 6 and b = 4. Therefore, the last digit of the minuend (A²) is 6, and the last digit of the subtrahend (B²) is 4.But wait, let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed any other pairs. For example, could there be a case where a - b is 12, which would also end with 2? But since we're only considering the last digit, 12 mod 10 is 2, but in reality, the difference is a two-digit number, so the last digit is 2, but the actual difference could be 12, 22, 32, etc. However, since we're only looking at the last digits of the minuend and subtrahend, the difference's last digit is 2 regardless of the higher digits. So, my initial approach is correct because we only need to consider the last digits.Another thing to consider: are there any other possible last digits for perfect squares that I might have missed? Let me think. The squares modulo 10 can only be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9, as I listed earlier. So, I haven't missed any.Wait, hold on. Let me think about negative differences. But since we're dealing with natural numbers, the difference must be positive, so a > b is already given, so we don't have to worry about negative differences.Is there a case where a - b = 12? For example, if a = 2 and b = 0, but 2 isn't a possible last digit of a perfect square. Similarly, a = 3 and b = 1, but 3 isn't a possible last digit either. So, no, the only way to get a difference ending with 2 is if a - b = 2, 12, 22, etc., but since a and b are single digits, the maximum a - b can be is 9 - 0 = 9. So, the only possible single-digit difference ending with 2 is 2 itself. Therefore, a - b must be exactly 2.Wait, that's not necessarily true. Because if a and b are single digits, but the actual numbers A² and B² could be larger, so their difference could be a two-digit number ending with 2, but the last digits of A² and B² could still be such that a - b = 12, but since a and b are single digits, a - b can't be 12. So, the only possibility is a - b = 2.Therefore, my initial conclusion stands: a = 6 and b = 4.But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other pairs where a - b = 2:Looking back at the possible last digits:- 0: Can't be a minuend because a > b, and 0 is the smallest.- 1: If a = 1, then b would have to be -1, which isn't possible.- 4: If a = 4, then b = 2, but 2 isn't a possible last digit.- 5: If a = 5, then b = 3, which isn't a possible last digit.- 6: If a = 6, then b = 4, which is possible.- 9: If a = 9, then b = 7, which isn't a possible last digit.So, indeed, the only possible pair is a = 6 and b = 4.Let me test this with actual numbers to make sure. For example, take A² = 16 (last digit 6) and B² = 4 (last digit 4). Then, 16 - 4 = 12, which ends with 2. Perfect.Another example: A² = 36, B² = 16. 36 - 16 = 20, which ends with 0, not 2. Hmm, that doesn't work. Wait, why?Oh, because 36 - 16 is 20, which ends with 0, not 2. So, that's a problem. Maybe my initial conclusion is too hasty.Wait, so 36 - 16 = 20, which doesn't end with 2. So, that's not a valid example. Let me find another example where A² ends with 6 and B² ends with 4, and their difference ends with 2.Let's try A² = 6² = 36 and B² = 2² = 4. 36 - 4 = 32, which ends with 2. Perfect.Another example: A² = 16 (4²) and B² = 4 (2²). 16 - 4 = 12, which ends with 2.Another one: A² = 81 (9²) and B² = 64 (8²). 81 - 64 = 17, which ends with 7, not 2. So, that doesn't work.Wait, so sometimes when a = 9 and b = 4, the difference ends with 5, but in this case, 81 - 64 = 17, which ends with 7. So, that doesn't fit.Wait, but in the case of a = 6 and b = 4, the difference ends with 2. So, 36 - 4 = 32, 16 - 4 = 12, 100 - 64 = 36, which ends with 6, not 2. Wait, 100 - 64 = 36. Hmm, that's 36, which ends with 6. So, that's not ending with 2.Wait, so maybe it's not always the case that a = 6 and b = 4 will result in a difference ending with 2. It depends on the actual numbers.Wait, so perhaps my initial conclusion is incomplete. Maybe I need to consider more than just the last digits. Because while the last digits of the squares are 6 and 4, the actual difference could have a last digit of 2 or 6 or something else, depending on the tens digit.Wait, so perhaps I need to consider not just the last digits, but also the tens digit. Because when subtracting two numbers, the last digit of the difference depends on both the last digits and the tens digits.Hmm, this complicates things. So, maybe my initial approach was too simplistic.Let me think again. The problem says that the difference ends with 2. So, the units digit of the difference is 2. The units digit of the difference is determined by the units digits of the two numbers being subtracted, but only if there is no borrowing from the tens place. If there is borrowing, then the units digit of the difference is 10 + (units digit of minuend - units digit of subtrahend).Wait, so if a > b, then there is no borrowing, and the units digit of the difference is simply a - b. But if a < b, then we have to borrow, making the units digit 10 + a - b.But in our case, the last digit of the minuend is greater than the last digit of the subtrahend, so there is no borrowing, and the units digit of the difference is a - b.Therefore, in our problem, since a > b, the units digit of the difference is a - b, which is 2. So, a - b = 2.Therefore, the only possible pair is a = 6 and b = 4, because 6 - 4 = 2, and both 6 and 4 are possible last digits of perfect squares.Wait, but earlier, I saw that 36 - 16 = 20, which ends with 0, not 2. So, why is that? Because 36 - 16 is 20, which is 2 in the tens place and 0 in the units place. So, the units digit is 0, not 2. So, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.Wait, so maybe my reasoning is flawed. Because even though a - b = 2, the actual difference could have a units digit of 2 or 0, depending on the tens digits.Wait, no, that can't be. Because if a - b = 2, and there is no borrowing, then the units digit of the difference must be 2. So, why in the case of 36 - 16 = 20, the units digit is 0?Wait, because 36 - 16 is 20, but 36 is 6² and 16 is 4². So, 6 - 4 = 2, but 3 - 1 = 2 in the tens place, so 20. Wait, but that's the difference. So, the units digit is 0 because 6 - 6 = 0, but wait, 36 is 3 and 6, 16 is 1 and 6. So, 6 - 6 = 0 in the units place, and 3 - 1 = 2 in the tens place. So, the difference is 20.Wait, so in this case, the units digits of the squares are both 6, so 6 - 6 = 0, but the tens digits are 3 and 1, so 3 - 1 = 2. So, the difference is 20.But in another case, say 16 - 4 = 12. So, 16 is 1 and 6, 4 is 0 and 4. So, 6 - 4 = 2 in the units place, and 1 - 0 = 1 in the tens place, so the difference is 12.Wait, so in this case, the units digits are 6 and 4, so 6 - 4 = 2, which gives the units digit of the difference as 2. But in the case of 36 - 16, the units digits are both 6, so 6 - 6 = 0, and the tens digits are 3 - 1 = 2, giving a difference of 20.So, the key here is that when the units digits are the same, the difference's units digit is 0, but when the units digits are different, the difference's units digit is a - b.Wait, so in our problem, the difference ends with 2, which means that the units digits of the minuend and subtrahend must be such that a - b = 2, without any borrowing. So, in this case, a = 6 and b = 4, because 6 - 4 = 2.But in the case where both units digits are 6, like 36 - 16, the difference ends with 0, not 2. So, that's why it's important that the units digits are different, specifically a = 6 and b = 4.Therefore, the only possible pair is a = 6 and b = 4.Let me test another example. Take A² = 6² = 36 and B² = 2² = 4. 36 - 4 = 32, which ends with 2. Perfect.Another example: A² = 16 (4²) and B² = 4 (2²). 16 - 4 = 12, which ends with 2.Another one: A² = 100 (10²) and B² = 64 (8²). 100 - 64 = 36, which ends with 6, not 2. So, that doesn't work. But in this case, the units digits are both 0 and 4, so 0 - 4 would require borrowing, but since the minuend's units digit is 0 and the subtrahend's is 4, which is less than 0, but wait, 0 is less than 4, so we have to borrow. Wait, but in this case, the minuend is 100 and the subtrahend is 64. So, 100 - 64 = 36. The units digit is 0 - 4, which can't be done without borrowing. So, we borrow 1 from the tens place, making it 10 - 4 = 6, and the tens digit becomes 9 - 6 = 3. So, the difference is 36, which ends with 6.But in this case, the units digits are 0 and 4, so a = 0 and b = 4, but since a < b, we have to borrow, making the units digit 10 + a - b = 10 + 0 - 4 = 6. So, the units digit of the difference is 6, not 2. So, that's why it doesn't fit.Therefore, in order for the difference to end with 2, the units digits must satisfy a - b = 2 without borrowing, meaning a > b and a - b = 2. So, the only possible pair is a = 6 and b = 4.Therefore, the last digit of the minuend is 6, and the last digit of the subtrahend is 4.I think that's the correct answer. Let me just summarize:- Perfect squares can only end with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.- The difference ends with 2, so (a - b) mod 10 = 2.- Since a > b, no borrowing occurs, so a - b = 2.- The only pair from the possible last digits is a = 6 and b = 4.Therefore, the last digits are 6 and 4."},{"question":"If the line 3x + y + a = 0 passes through the center of the circle x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y = 0, then the value of a is boxed{________}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: the line (3x + y + a = 0) passes through the center of the circle given by the equation (x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y = 0). I need to find the value of (a). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the general equation of a circle is (x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0), and its center is at ((-D/2, -E/2)). So, in this case, the given circle equation is (x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y = 0). Comparing this with the general form, I can see that (D = 2) and (E = -4). Let me write that down:- (D = 2)- (E = -4)So, the center of the circle should be at ((-D/2, -E/2)), which would be ((-2/2, -(-4)/2)). Calculating that:- The x-coordinate: (-2/2 = -1)- The y-coordinate: (-(-4)/2 = 4/2 = 2)So, the center of the circle is at ((-1, 2)). Got that.Now, the problem says that the line (3x + y + a = 0) passes through this center. That means if I plug the coordinates of the center into the line equation, it should satisfy the equation. In other words, substituting (x = -1) and (y = 2) into (3x + y + a = 0) should make the equation true.Let me write that substitution out:(3(-1) + 2 + a = 0)Calculating each term:- (3(-1) = -3)- So, now the equation becomes: (-3 + 2 + a = 0)Simplify (-3 + 2):- (-3 + 2 = -1)So now, the equation is:(-1 + a = 0)To solve for (a), I can add 1 to both sides:(-1 + a + 1 = 0 + 1)Simplifying:(a = 1)So, the value of (a) is 1. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I found the center of the circle by using the general equation. That seems right because the standard form is ((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2), so completing the square would give me the center, but since the given equation is already in general form, I can directly find the center as ((-D/2, -E/2)). So, that step is correct.2. Substituting (D = 2) and (E = -4), I got the center at ((-1, 2)). That seems correct because dividing 2 by 2 gives 1, and the negative of that is -1. Similarly, for E, which is -4, dividing by 2 gives -2, and the negative of that is 2. So, center is indeed (-1, 2).3. Then, substituting the center into the line equation: (3x + y + a = 0). Plugging in x = -1 and y = 2, I get (3(-1) + 2 + a = 0). Calculating that gives -3 + 2 + a = 0, which simplifies to -1 + a = 0. Solving for a gives a = 1. That seems straightforward.Wait, let me just verify the substitution again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.Calculating (3(-1)): that's -3. Then, adding 2: -3 + 2 is indeed -1. So, the equation becomes -1 + a = 0, so a must be 1. Yep, that seems right.Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by finding the equation of the circle in standard form and then finding the center?Let me try that method as a check.Starting with the given circle equation: (x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y = 0). To write this in standard form, I need to complete the square for both x and y terms.First, group the x terms and y terms:((x^2 + 2x) + (y^2 - 4y) = 0)Now, complete the square for x:Take the coefficient of x, which is 2, divide by 2 to get 1, square it to get 1. So, add and subtract 1.Similarly, for y:Take the coefficient of y, which is -4, divide by 2 to get -2, square it to get 4. So, add and subtract 4.So, rewriting the equation:((x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1) + (y^2 - 4y + 4 - 4) = 0)Simplify:((x + 1)^2 - 1 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 = 0)Combine constants:((x + 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 5 = 0)Bring the constant to the other side:((x + 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 5)So, the standard form of the circle is ((x + 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 5), which confirms that the center is at (-1, 2), as I found earlier. The radius is (sqrt{5}), but that's not needed here.So, this method also gives me the center at (-1, 2). Therefore, substituting into the line equation is the correct approach.Another thought: maybe I can solve for a using another method, like finding the distance from the center to the line and setting it equal to zero, since the line passes through the center. But wait, the distance from a point to a line is zero if the point lies on the line, which is exactly the case here. So, maybe I can use the distance formula.The formula for the distance from a point ((x_0, y_0)) to the line (Ax + By + C = 0) is:[text{Distance} = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}]In this case, the line is (3x + y + a = 0), so (A = 3), (B = 1), and (C = a). The point is the center, which is (-1, 2). Since the line passes through the center, the distance should be zero. So, plugging into the distance formula:[frac{|3(-1) + 1(2) + a|}{sqrt{3^2 + 1^2}} = 0]Simplify numerator:(|-3 + 2 + a| = |(-1) + a| = |a - 1|)Denominator:(sqrt{9 + 1} = sqrt{10})So, the equation becomes:[frac{|a - 1|}{sqrt{10}} = 0]Since the denominator is positive, the numerator must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. Therefore:(|a - 1| = 0)Which implies:(a - 1 = 0)So, (a = 1). Wow, that's another way to get the same result. So, whether I substitute the center into the line equation directly or use the distance formula, I end up with (a = 1). That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.Let me recap the steps I took:1. Recognized that the center of the circle can be found from the general equation.2. Calculated the center as (-1, 2).3. Substituted this center into the line equation to solve for (a).4. Verified the result using the distance formula method, which also gave (a = 1).I think I've covered all the bases here. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same answer. So, I feel confident that (a = 1) is the correct value.Just to make sure, let me plug (a = 1) back into the line equation and see if it indeed passes through (-1, 2).The line equation becomes (3x + y + 1 = 0). Plugging in x = -1 and y = 2:(3(-1) + 2 + 1 = -3 + 2 + 1 = 0). Yep, that works. So, the point (-1, 2) lies on the line when (a = 1). Perfect.I think that's thorough enough. I can't think of any other ways to approach this problem, and all my methods confirm that (a = 1). So, I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.**Final Answer**The value of (a) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"The degree of the monomial x^{2}y is ____.","answer":"To determine the degree of the monomial ( x^{2}y ), I start by identifying the exponents of each variable in the expression.

Hmm, lattice points are points where both the x and y coordinates are integers. So, I need to figure out how many integer solutions (x, y) satisfy the equation of this circle.First, let me write down the equation of the circle. The general equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2. Plugging in the given values, the equation becomes:(x - 199)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 199^2Simplifying that, it's:(x - 199)^2 + y^2 = 199^2So, I need to find all integer pairs (x, y) such that when I plug them into this equation, it holds true.Let me rearrange the equation a bit to see if I can simplify it or make it easier to work with. If I subtract (x - 199)^2 from both sides, I get:y^2 = 199^2 - (x - 199)^2Which can be written as:y^2 = (199 - (x - 199))(199 + (x - 199))Wait, that's factoring the difference of squares. So, 199^2 - (x - 199)^2 factors into (199 - (x - 199))(199 + (x - 199)). Let me compute those terms:199 - (x - 199) = 199 - x + 199 = 398 - x199 + (x - 199) = 199 + x - 199 = xSo, substituting back, we have:y^2 = (398 - x)(x)So, y^2 = x(398 - x)Hmm, that's interesting. So, y squared is equal to x times (398 - x). Since y is an integer, y^2 must be a perfect square. Therefore, x(398 - x) must be a perfect square.Let me denote x as some integer. Let's let x be an integer variable, and then 398 - x is also an integer. So, the product x(398 - x) must be a perfect square.Let me denote k = x. Then, 398 - x = 398 - k. So, the product is k(398 - k). So, we have k(398 - k) is a perfect square.So, the problem reduces to finding all integers k such that k(398 - k) is a perfect square. Then, for each such k, y would be the square root of that product, which would be an integer.But, how do I find all such integers k? Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can think about the factors of k and (398 - k). Since their product is a square, each prime factor in their product must have an even exponent.So, if I can write k and (398 - k) as products where their combined exponents are even, that would make their product a square. Alternatively, perhaps k and (398 - k) are both squares themselves, but that might not necessarily be the case because they could share common factors.Wait, another approach: Let me set d = gcd(k, 398 - k). Then, since d divides both k and 398 - k, it must also divide their sum, which is 398. So, d is a divisor of 398.Let me factorize 398 to find its divisors. 398 divided by 2 is 199, which is a prime number. So, 398 = 2 × 199. Therefore, the divisors of 398 are 1, 2, 199, and 398.So, d can be 1, 2, 199, or 398.Let me express k and (398 - k) in terms of d. Let me write k = d × m and 398 - k = d × n, where m and n are coprime integers (since d is the gcd). Then, since k + (398 - k) = 398, we have d(m + n) = 398. Therefore, m + n = 398 / d.Also, since k(398 - k) = d^2 × m × n must be a perfect square. Since m and n are coprime, m × n must be a perfect square. But since m and n are coprime, each of them must individually be perfect squares. Because if two coprime numbers multiply to a square, each must be a square themselves.Therefore, m = a^2 and n = b^2, where a and b are positive integers. Then, m + n = a^2 + b^2 = 398 / d.So, for each divisor d of 398, we can write 398 / d as a sum of two squares. Then, the number of solutions (a, b) to a^2 + b^2 = 398 / d will give us the number of possible k's, and hence the number of lattice points.So, let's consider each divisor d of 398:1. d = 1:   Then, 398 / d = 398. So, we need to find the number of integer solutions (a, b) to a^2 + b^2 = 398.2. d = 2:   Then, 398 / d = 199. So, find the number of integer solutions (a, b) to a^2 + b^2 = 199.3. d = 199:   Then, 398 / d = 2. So, find the number of integer solutions (a, b) to a^2 + b^2 = 2.4. d = 398:   Then, 398 / d = 1. So, find the number of integer solutions (a, b) to a^2 + b^2 = 1.Let me compute each case separately.Case 1: d = 1, equation a^2 + b^2 = 398.I need to find all integer pairs (a, b) such that a^2 + b^2 = 398.First, let's note that 398 is even, so both a and b must be even or both odd. But 398 is 2 mod 4, because 398 divided by 2 is 199, which is odd. So, 398 is 2 mod 4.But squares mod 4 are either 0 or 1. So, if a and b are both even, their squares are 0 mod 4, so sum would be 0 mod 4. But 398 is 2 mod 4, so that's not possible. If one is even and one is odd, their squares would be 0 + 1 = 1 mod 4, which is not 2. If both are odd, their squares would be 1 + 1 = 2 mod 4, which matches. Therefore, a and b must both be odd.So, let me look for odd integers a and b such that a^2 + b^2 = 398.Let me compute the possible a's. Since a^2 <= 398, a can be at most sqrt(398) ≈ 19.949, so a can be from -19 to 19, but since we're dealing with squares, we can consider positive a and then account for negative counterparts.But since a and b are both odd, let's list the odd numbers less than or equal to 19: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19.Let me compute their squares:1^2 = 13^2 = 95^2 = 257^2 = 499^2 = 8111^2 = 12113^2 = 16915^2 = 22517^2 = 28919^2 = 361Now, let's see which pairs add up to 398.Starting from the largest square less than 398, which is 361.398 - 361 = 37. Is 37 a square? 37 is not a perfect square.Next, 289: 398 - 289 = 109. Not a square.225: 398 - 225 = 173. Not a square.169: 398 - 169 = 229. Not a square.121: 398 - 121 = 277. Not a square.81: 398 - 81 = 317. Not a square.49: 398 - 49 = 349. Not a square.25: 398 - 25 = 373. Not a square.9: 398 - 9 = 389. Not a square.1: 398 - 1 = 397. Not a square.Hmm, none of these differences are perfect squares. So, does that mean there are no solutions for d = 1?Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, 398 is 2 × 199, and 199 is a prime number. Is 199 a prime of the form 4k + 3? Let me check: 199 divided by 4 is 49.75, so 4 × 49 = 196, so 199 = 4 × 49 + 3, yes, it's 4k + 3.Now, primes of the form 4k + 3 cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares unless they are squared themselves, but 199 is prime, so it can't be expressed as a sum of two squares. Therefore, 199 cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares, and since 398 = 2 × 199, and 2 is a prime of the form 4k + 2, which can be expressed as a sum of two squares (1^2 + 1^2), but when multiplied by a prime of the form 4k + 3, which cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares, the product also cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares.Wait, is that the case? Let me recall the theorem: A number can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if in its prime factorization, every prime of the form 4k + 3 occurs an even number of times. In this case, 398 = 2 × 199, and 199 is 4k + 3 raised to the first power, which is odd. Therefore, 398 cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares. Therefore, there are no integer solutions (a, b) for a^2 + b^2 = 398. So, case d = 1 gives us zero solutions.Case 2: d = 2, equation a^2 + b^2 = 199.Similarly, 199 is a prime number, and as before, 199 is 4k + 3 (since 199 = 4×49 + 3). So, according to the theorem, 199 cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares because it's a prime of the form 4k + 3 raised to an odd power (1). Therefore, there are no integer solutions (a, b) for a^2 + b^2 = 199. So, case d = 2 also gives us zero solutions.Case 3: d = 199, equation a^2 + b^2 = 2.This is simpler. The equation a^2 + b^2 = 2 has solutions where a and b are integers. The possible integer solutions are (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1). So, there are 4 solutions.Case 4: d = 398, equation a^2 + b^2 = 1.This equation has solutions (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1). So, 4 solutions.Therefore, summarizing:- d = 1: 0 solutions- d = 2: 0 solutions- d = 199: 4 solutions- d = 398: 4 solutionsSo, total solutions for (a, b) are 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 8.But wait, each solution (a, b) corresponds to a pair (m, n) where m = a^2 and n = b^2, right? So, for each (a, b), we get m and n, which then give us k = d × m and 398 - k = d × n.But let me think again. For each divisor d, we have a certain number of (a, b) pairs, which correspond to (m, n) pairs, which in turn give us k = d × m.But since m and n are positive integers (as squares), but k can be positive or negative? Wait, no, because k is defined as x, which is an integer, but in our earlier substitution, k = x, and 398 - k is positive because x must be less than or equal to 398 for y^2 to be non-negative.Wait, actually, x can be any integer, but y^2 must be non-negative, so x(398 - x) must be non-negative. Therefore, x must be between 0 and 398 inclusive. Because if x is negative, then x is negative and 398 - x is positive, so their product is negative, which cannot be a square. Similarly, if x > 398, then x is positive and 398 - x is negative, so their product is negative, which again cannot be a square. Therefore, x must be in [0, 398].Therefore, k is in [0, 398], so m and n are positive integers such that m + n = 398 / d, and m and n are squares.But in our earlier substitution, we considered m and n as positive integers, but actually, in the equation a^2 + b^2 = s, a and b can be positive or negative, but since m and n are squares, they are non-negative. However, in our problem, m and n are positive because k and 398 - k are positive (since x is between 0 and 398). Therefore, m and n must be positive integers.Wait, but in the case of d = 199, we had a^2 + b^2 = 2, which gave us (a, b) as (1,1), (1,-1), etc. But since m and n are squares, they are non-negative, so m = a^2 and n = b^2, which would be 1 and 1. So, m = 1, n = 1.Similarly, for d = 398, a^2 + b^2 = 1, which gives m = 1, n = 0 or m = 0, n = 1. Wait, but in our earlier substitution, m and n are both positive? Or can they be zero?Wait, if m = 0, then k = d × m = 0, and 398 - k = 398, which would be d × n. So, n = 398 / d. But in the case of d = 398, m + n = 1, so m and n can be 0 and 1 or 1 and 0.But in our earlier substitution, m and n are coprime. Wait, if m = 0, then n = 1, but gcd(0,1) is 1, so that's okay. Similarly, m = 1, n = 0.But in the case of d = 199, m + n = 2, and m and n are squares. So, m = 1, n = 1.So, for each divisor d, the number of solutions (m, n) is equal to the number of representations of 398 / d as a sum of two squares, considering order and signs.Wait, but in our earlier substitution, each (a, b) gives a unique (m, n). However, since m and n are squares, each (a, b) corresponds to a unique (m, n), but m and n are positive integers.But in our problem, since k = d × m and 398 - k = d × n, and since k and 398 - k are positive, m and n must be positive integers as well.Wait, but in the case of d = 398, m + n = 1, so m and n can be 0 and 1. So, m = 0, n = 1 or m = 1, n = 0. But m = 0 would imply k = 0, which is acceptable because x can be 0. Similarly, m = 1 would imply k = 398, which is also acceptable because x can be 398.So, in that case, for d = 398, we have two solutions: k = 0 and k = 398.Similarly, for d = 199, m + n = 2, which can be written as 1 + 1, so m = 1, n = 1. So, k = 199 × 1 = 199, and 398 - k = 199 × 1 = 199. So, k = 199 is the only solution in this case.Wait, but earlier, I thought there were 4 solutions for d = 199 because of the signs of a and b, but since m and n are squares, they are non-negative, so each (a, b) corresponds to a unique (m, n). Therefore, even though (a, b) can be (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), they all result in m = 1 and n = 1. So, in terms of k, it's only k = 199 × 1 = 199.Similarly, for d = 398, (a, b) can be (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), but these correspond to m = 1, n = 0 or m = 0, n = 1. So, k can be 398 × 1 = 398 or 398 × 0 = 0.Therefore, for each d, the number of distinct k's is equal to the number of distinct representations of 398 / d as a sum of two squares, considering that m and n are non-negative integers.But in our earlier analysis, for d = 199, we have only one distinct k: 199, and for d = 398, we have two distinct k's: 0 and 398.Wait, but in the case of d = 199, m = 1 and n = 1, so k = 199 × 1 = 199, and 398 - k = 199, so that's only one k.For d = 398, m can be 0 or 1, so k can be 0 or 398, which are two distinct k's.Therefore, the total number of k's is 1 (from d = 199) + 2 (from d = 398) = 3.But wait, earlier I thought there were 8 solutions, but now I'm getting 3 k's. Hmm, I think I need to reconcile this.Wait, perhaps each k corresponds to multiple (x, y) points because y can be positive or negative. So, for each k, we have y^2 = k(398 - k), so y can be sqrt(k(398 - k)) or -sqrt(k(398 - k)). So, for each k, we have two points unless y = 0.But in our case, for k = 0, y^2 = 0 × 398 = 0, so y = 0. Similarly, for k = 398, y^2 = 398 × 0 = 0, so y = 0. For k = 199, y^2 = 199 × 199 = 199^2, so y = 199 or y = -199.Therefore, for each k:- k = 0: y = 0. So, one point: (0, 0)- k = 199: y = 199 or y = -199. So, two points: (199, 199) and (199, -199)- k = 398: y = 0. So, one point: (398, 0)Wait, but hold on, the original circle is centered at (199, 0) with radius 199. So, the point (0, 0) is 199 units away from (199, 0), which is correct. Similarly, (398, 0) is also 199 units away. The point (199, 199) is sqrt((199 - 199)^2 + (199 - 0)^2) = 199 units away, which is correct.So, in total, we have:- (0, 0)- (398, 0)- (199, 199)- (199, -199)That's four points.But wait, earlier, I thought there were 8 solutions, but now I'm getting 4 points. So, perhaps I overcounted earlier.Wait, let's think again. For each divisor d, the number of solutions (a, b) is equal to the number of representations of 398 / d as a sum of two squares, considering all sign combinations and order.But in our substitution, each (a, b) gives a unique (m, n), but m and n are non-negative, so each (a, b) with different signs or orders would correspond to the same (m, n). Therefore, for each (m, n), we have multiple (a, b)'s.But in our problem, each (m, n) corresponds to a unique k, but each k can correspond to multiple (x, y) points because y can be positive or negative.Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each (a, b), we have a unique (m, n), which gives a unique k, but each k can lead to two points (x, y) unless y = 0.But in our case, for d = 199, we have k = 199, which gives y = ±199, so two points.For d = 398, we have k = 0 and k = 398, each giving y = 0, so one point each.Therefore, total points are 2 (from k = 199) + 1 (from k = 0) + 1 (from k = 398) = 4 points.But wait, earlier, I thought there were 8 solutions for (a, b), but that was considering all sign combinations. However, in reality, each (a, b) corresponds to the same (m, n), which gives the same k, but different y's.Wait, no, actually, for each (a, b), we have a unique k, but y is determined by sqrt(k(398 - k)). So, for each (a, b), we get a unique k, but y is fixed as sqrt(k(398 - k)) or negative.But in our substitution, for each divisor d, the number of (a, b) pairs is equal to the number of representations of 398 / d as a sum of two squares, considering all sign combinations and order. So, for d = 199, we have 4 solutions (a, b): (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1). Each of these would give m = 1, n = 1, so k = 199 × 1 = 199. So, regardless of the signs of a and b, we get the same k. Therefore, for d = 199, we have only one k, but y can be positive or negative, so two points.Similarly, for d = 398, we have 4 solutions (a, b): (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1). Each of these gives either m = 1, n = 0 or m = 0, n = 1, so k = 398 × 1 = 398 or k = 398 × 0 = 0. So, for d = 398, we have two k's: 0 and 398, each giving y = 0, so one point each.Therefore, the total number of points is 2 (from d = 199) + 2 (from d = 398) = 4 points.Wait, but hold on, when d = 398, we have k = 0 and k = 398, each giving y = 0. So, that's two points: (0, 0) and (398, 0). For d = 199, we have k = 199, giving y = ±199, so two points: (199, 199) and (199, -199). So, in total, 4 points.But wait, is that all? Because the circle is centered at (199, 0) with radius 199, so it should pass through the origin (0,0) and (398, 0). Also, it should pass through (199, 199) and (199, -199). Are there any other lattice points on this circle?Wait, let me think. Maybe I missed some cases where k(398 - k) is a square, but k is not necessarily 0, 199, or 398. Maybe there are other k's where k(398 - k) is a perfect square.But according to our earlier analysis, the only k's that satisfy k(398 - k) being a perfect square are k = 0, 199, and 398. Because when we considered the equation y^2 = x(398 - x), we found that the only solutions are when x = 0, 199, or 398, leading to y = 0 or ±199.But wait, let me test another value. For example, let me take x = 199 + t, where t is some integer. Then, (x - 199)^2 + y^2 = 199^2 becomes t^2 + y^2 = 199^2. So, this is equivalent to finding all integer solutions to t^2 + y^2 = 199^2.But 199 is a prime number, and 199 ≡ 3 mod 4, which cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares. However, 199^2 can be expressed as a sum of two squares because it's a square itself. Specifically, 199^2 = 0^2 + 199^2, which gives t = 0, y = ±199, which we already have. Also, 199^2 = (199)^2 + 0^2, which gives t = ±199, y = 0. But t = 199 would give x = 199 + 199 = 398, and t = -199 would give x = 0, which are already accounted for.Therefore, the only integer solutions to t^2 + y^2 = 199^2 are (t, y) = (0, ±199), (±199, 0). So, translating back to x, we have x = 199 + t, so x = 199, 0, or 398, which gives us the four points we found earlier.So, it seems that indeed, there are only four lattice points on the circumference of this circle.Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe there are other points where x is not 0, 199, or 398, but k(398 - k) is still a perfect square.Let me pick a random x, say x = 100. Then, y^2 = 100 × (398 - 100) = 100 × 298 = 29800. Is 29800 a perfect square? Let's see. sqrt(29800) ≈ 172.6, which is not an integer, so no.Another x, say x = 198. Then, y^2 = 198 × (398 - 198) = 198 × 200 = 39600. sqrt(39600) = 199, which is an integer. Wait, 199^2 is 39601, not 39600. So, 39600 is not a perfect square. Wait, 199^2 is 39601, so 39600 is 199^2 - 1, which is not a square.Wait, so x = 198 gives y^2 = 39600, which is not a perfect square.How about x = 197? y^2 = 197 × (398 - 197) = 197 × 201. Let's compute 197 × 201. 200 × 201 = 40200, minus 3 × 201 = 603, so 40200 - 603 = 39597. sqrt(39597) ≈ 198.99, not an integer.x = 200: y^2 = 200 × 198 = 39600, which is not a square.x = 150: y^2 = 150 × 248 = 37200. sqrt(37200) ≈ 192.87, not integer.x = 120: y^2 = 120 × 278 = 33360. sqrt(33360) ≈ 182.65, not integer.x = 99: y^2 = 99 × 299 = 29601. sqrt(29601) = 172.05, not integer.Wait, 172^2 = 29584, 173^2 = 29929, so 29601 is between them, not a square.x = 10: y^2 = 10 × 388 = 3880. sqrt(3880) ≈ 62.29, not integer.x = 1: y^2 = 1 × 397 = 397, which is prime, not a square.x = 2: y^2 = 2 × 396 = 792, not a square.x = 3: y^2 = 3 × 395 = 1185, not a square.x = 4: y^2 = 4 × 394 = 1576, not a square.x = 5: y^2 = 5 × 393 = 1965, not a square.x = 6: y^2 = 6 × 392 = 2352, not a square.x = 7: y^2 = 7 × 391 = 2737, not a square.x = 8: y^2 = 8 × 390 = 3120, not a square.x = 9: y^2 = 9 × 389 = 3501, not a square.x = 10: already checked.So, it seems that for x between 0 and 398, the only x's that give y^2 as a perfect square are x = 0, 199, and 398. Therefore, the only lattice points on the circle are (0, 0), (398, 0), (199, 199), and (199, -199).Therefore, the number of lattice points is 4.But wait, hold on a second. The circle is centered at (199, 0) with radius 199, so it passes through the origin and (398, 0). Also, it passes through (199, 199) and (199, -199). Are there any other points?Wait, let me think about the symmetry. The circle is symmetric about the x-axis, so for every point (x, y), there is a point (x, -y). But in our case, the only points with y ≠ 0 are (199, 199) and (199, -199). So, that's two points.Additionally, the circle is symmetric about the line x = 199, so reflecting over that line would map (0, 0) to (398, 0) and vice versa, which are both on the circle.But are there any other points where x ≠ 0, 199, 398? For example, could there be a point where x is some other integer, and y is an integer such that (x - 199)^2 + y^2 = 199^2?But from our earlier trials, it seems that such x's do not exist because k(398 - k) is not a perfect square except when k = 0, 199, 398.Therefore, I think the conclusion is that there are only four lattice points on the circle.Wait, but let me think again about the equation y^2 = x(398 - x). For y to be an integer, x(398 - x) must be a perfect square. So, we need x and (398 - x) such that their product is a square.But x and (398 - x) are co-prime? Not necessarily. For example, if x is even, then both x and (398 - x) are even, so they share a common factor of 2.Wait, let me consider that. If x is even, let x = 2k, then 398 - x = 398 - 2k = 2(199 - k). So, x(398 - x) = 4k(199 - k). So, y^2 = 4k(199 - k). Therefore, k(199 - k) must be a perfect square.Similarly, if x is odd, then x and (398 - x) are both odd, so they are co-prime? Wait, not necessarily. For example, if x and (398 - x) share a common factor d, then d divides x and 398 - x, so d divides 398. Since 398 = 2 × 199, and if x is odd, then d must be 1 or 199.But if d = 199, then x = 199m and 398 - x = 199n, so 199(m + n) = 398, so m + n = 2. Therefore, m and n are 1 and 1, so x = 199, which is the case we already considered.Therefore, for x odd, x and (398 - x) are co-prime unless x is a multiple of 199, which only happens when x = 199.Therefore, for x even, x = 2k, and 398 - x = 2(199 - k). So, x(398 - x) = 4k(199 - k). So, y^2 = 4k(199 - k). Therefore, k(199 - k) must be a perfect square.So, let me set k(199 - k) = m^2, where m is an integer.Then, k(199 - k) = m^2.This is similar to the original equation but with 199 instead of 398.So, we can analyze this equation similarly.Let me denote d = gcd(k, 199 - k). Then, d divides 199, which is prime. So, d can be 1 or 199.Case 1: d = 1.Then, k and (199 - k) are co-prime. Therefore, since their product is a perfect square, both k and (199 - k) must be perfect squares.So, k = a^2 and 199 - k = b^2, where a and b are positive integers. Then, a^2 + b^2 = 199.But 199 is a prime of the form 4k + 3, so it cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.Case 2: d = 199.Then, k = 199m and 199 - k = 199n, where m and n are integers. Then, 199(m + n) = 199, so m + n = 1.Since m and n are integers, the possible solutions are m = 1, n = 0 or m = 0, n = 1.Therefore, k = 199 × 1 = 199 or k = 199 × 0 = 0.So, k = 199 or k = 0.Therefore, for x even, the only solutions are k = 0 and k = 199, which correspond to x = 0 and x = 398.Therefore, in the case of x even, we only get x = 0 and x = 398 as solutions, which we already considered.Therefore, combining both cases, the only solutions are x = 0, 199, 398, leading to y = 0 or ±199.Therefore, the only lattice points on the circle are (0, 0), (398, 0), (199, 199), and (199, -199). So, four points in total.Hence, the number of lattice points on the circumference of the circle is 4.**Final Answer**The number of lattice points on the circumference of the circle is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Henry's little brother has 8 identical stickers and 4 identical sheets of paper. How many ways are there for him to put all of the stickers on the sheets of paper, if only the number of stickers on each sheet matters?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Henry's little brother has 8 identical stickers and 4 identical sheets of paper. I need to figure out how many ways he can distribute all the stickers onto the sheets, where only the number of stickers on each sheet matters. Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.First off, the stickers are identical, which means it doesn't matter which specific sticker goes on which sheet; only the count matters. Similarly, the sheets of paper are identical, so swapping stickers between sheets doesn't create a new distribution. So, this is a problem about partitioning identical objects into identical groups. I remember something about partitions in mathematics, so maybe that's the right direction.Let me recall, a partition of a number is a way of writing it as a sum of positive integers, where the order doesn't matter. So, for example, the number 4 can be partitioned as 4, 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1, and 1+1+1+1. Each of these represents a different way to distribute 4 identical items into identical groups. So, in this case, we have 8 stickers and 4 sheets, so we need the number of partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts. Each part represents the number of stickers on a sheet, and since the sheets are identical, the order of the parts doesn't matter.Wait, hold on. The problem says \\"if only the number of stickers on each sheet matters.\\" So, does that mean that each sheet must have at least one sticker? Or can some sheets have zero stickers? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify that each sheet must have at least one sticker, so I think it's allowed for some sheets to have zero. But in the context of distributing stickers, having a sheet with zero stickers is just not using that sheet. So, maybe we can consider the problem as distributing 8 identical stickers into up to 4 identical sheets, where some sheets can be empty.But in terms of partitions, if we allow empty sheets, then it's equivalent to partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts, where parts can be zero. However, typically, in partitions, we consider positive integers. So, perhaps it's better to think of it as partitions of 8 into exactly 4 parts, where parts can be zero, but since the sheets are identical, the order doesn't matter.Wait, but in standard partition terminology, the number of partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts is the same as the number of partitions of 8 where the largest part is at most 4. Hmm, no, actually, that's not quite right. Let me clarify.In partition function terms, p(n, k) is the number of partitions of n into exactly k parts. So, if we have 8 stickers and 4 sheets, and we allow sheets to have zero stickers, then it's equivalent to p(8,4). But wait, no, because p(n,k) counts the number of partitions of n into exactly k positive integers. So, if we allow zeros, it's a bit different.But in our case, since the sheets are identical, having a sheet with zero stickers is just not considering it. So, maybe it's better to think of it as the number of partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts, where each part is a positive integer. So, that would be p(8,1) + p(8,2) + p(8,3) + p(8,4). But wait, no, that's the total number of partitions of 8 into 1, 2, 3, or 4 parts. But since the sheets are identical, the number of ways is equal to the number of partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts.Wait, let me check that. So, if we have 4 sheets, each sheet can have 0 or more stickers, but since the sheets are identical, the order doesn't matter. So, the number of distinct distributions is equal to the number of integer partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts. So, that is, the number of ways to write 8 as a sum of positive integers where the number of terms is at most 4, and the order doesn't matter.Alternatively, it's the same as the number of partitions of 8 where each part is at most 4. Wait, no, that's not the same. The number of partitions into at most 4 parts is different from the number of partitions where each part is at most 4. For example, the partition 4+4 is a partition of 8 into 2 parts, each of size 4, which is counted in both. But partitions like 5+3 are counted in partitions into parts at most 5, but not in partitions into at most 2 parts.Wait, maybe I need to clarify this. Let me recall that the number of partitions of n into at most k parts is equal to the number of partitions of n where the largest part is at most k. So, in our case, if we have 8 stickers and 4 sheets, the number of ways is equal to the number of partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts, which is the same as the number of partitions of 8 where each part is at most 4.But wait, no, that's not correct. The number of partitions into at most k parts is equal to the number of partitions where the largest part is at most k. So, for example, the number of partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts is equal to the number of partitions of 8 where each part is at most 4. So, in that case, both interpretations lead to the same count.But let me verify this with an example. Let's take n=4 and k=2. The number of partitions of 4 into at most 2 parts is 2: 4 and 3+1. The number of partitions of 4 where each part is at most 2 is also 2: 2+2 and 2+1+1, but wait, that's 3 partitions. Wait, no, hold on.Wait, no, actually, partitions into at most 2 parts for n=4 are:1. 42. 3+13. 2+2So, that's 3 partitions. On the other hand, partitions of 4 where each part is at most 2 are:1. 2+22. 2+1+13. 1+1+1+1So, that's 3 partitions as well. Hmm, so in this case, they are equal. So, maybe my initial thought was correct: the number of partitions into at most k parts is equal to the number of partitions where each part is at most k.Wait, but in the case of n=5 and k=3:Partitions into at most 3 parts:1. 52. 4+13. 3+24. 3+1+15. 2+2+1So, 5 partitions.Partitions where each part is at most 3:1. 3+22. 3+1+13. 2+2+14. 2+1+1+15. 1+1+1+1+1Wait, that's 5 partitions as well. Hmm, so maybe it's a general result that the number of partitions of n into at most k parts is equal to the number of partitions of n into parts of size at most k.Yes, that's a standard result in partition theory, known as conjugation. The number of partitions of n into at most k parts is equal to the number of partitions of n into parts each of size at most k. So, in our case, the number of partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts is equal to the number of partitions of 8 into parts each of size at most 4.Therefore, we can compute either one. So, let's compute the number of partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts. Alternatively, the number of partitions of 8 where each part is at most 4. Let's try to list them.First, let's list all partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts.Starting with the largest possible part:1. 8 (1 part)2. 7+1 (2 parts)3. 6+2 (2 parts)4. 6+1+1 (3 parts)5. 5+3 (2 parts)6. 5+2+1 (3 parts)7. 5+1+1+1 (4 parts)8. 4+4 (2 parts)9. 4+3+1 (3 parts)10. 4+2+2 (3 parts)11. 4+2+1+1 (4 parts)12. 3+3+2 (3 parts)13. 3+3+1+1 (4 parts)14. 3+2+2+1 (4 parts)15. 2+2+2+2 (4 parts)Wait, let me count these:1. 82. 7+13. 6+24. 6+1+15. 5+36. 5+2+17. 5+1+1+18. 4+49. 4+3+110. 4+2+211. 4+2+1+112. 3+3+213. 3+3+1+114. 3+2+2+115. 2+2+2+2So, that's 15 partitions. Hmm, but wait, I thought the number of partitions of 8 is 22, so 15 is less than that. But we are only considering partitions into at most 4 parts, so that makes sense.Alternatively, if we consider partitions into parts of size at most 4, let's list them:1. 4+42. 4+3+13. 4+2+24. 4+2+1+15. 4+1+1+1+1 (but this is 5 parts, which is more than 4, so we can't include this)Wait, no, if we are considering parts of size at most 4, regardless of the number of parts, but in our case, since the sheets are 4, we can have up to 4 parts. So, actually, the number of partitions of 8 into parts of size at most 4 is the same as the number of partitions into at most 4 parts, which is 15.But wait, when I listed the partitions into parts of size at most 4, I included some with more than 4 parts, but since we have only 4 sheets, we can't have more than 4 parts. So, actually, the number of partitions of 8 into parts of size at most 4 and with at most 4 parts is the same as the number of partitions into at most 4 parts, which is 15.Wait, but when I listed the partitions into at most 4 parts, I got 15, but when I tried to list partitions into parts of size at most 4, I started listing but had to stop because some had more than 4 parts. So, perhaps it's better to stick with the first method.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the partitions into at most 4 parts.Starting with 1 part:1. 82 parts:2. 7+13. 6+24. 5+35. 4+43 parts:6. 6+1+17. 5+2+18. 4+3+19. 4+2+210. 3+3+24 parts:11. 5+1+1+112. 4+2+1+113. 3+3+1+114. 3+2+2+115. 2+2+2+2Yes, that's 15 partitions. So, the number of ways is 15.Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because sometimes when you have identical sheets, the problem is equivalent to the number of integer partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts. So, the answer should be 15.But let me cross-verify this with another method. Another way to compute the number of partitions of n into at most k parts is to use the stars and bars theorem, but wait, no, stars and bars counts the number of ways when the bins are distinguishable. Since in our case, the sheets are identical, stars and bars isn't directly applicable.Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions. The generating function for partitions into at most 4 parts is:(1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...)(1 + x^2 + x^4 + ...)(1 + x^3 + x^6 + ...)(1 + x^4 + x^8 + ...)But that might be complicated. Alternatively, the generating function for partitions into at most 4 parts is:1 / ((1 - x)(1 - x^2)(1 - x^3)(1 - x^4))But expanding this to find the coefficient of x^8 might be tedious, but perhaps manageable.Alternatively, maybe using the partition function P(n, k), which counts the number of partitions of n into exactly k parts. So, the total number of partitions into at most 4 parts is P(8,1) + P(8,2) + P(8,3) + P(8,4).Let me compute each of these:P(8,1): There's only 1 way, which is 8 itself.P(8,2): The number of partitions of 8 into exactly 2 positive integers. These are:1. 7+12. 6+23. 5+34. 4+4So, 4 ways.P(8,3): The number of partitions of 8 into exactly 3 positive integers. Let's list them:1. 6+1+12. 5+2+13. 4+3+14. 4+2+25. 3+3+2So, 5 ways.P(8,4): The number of partitions of 8 into exactly 4 positive integers. These are:1. 5+1+1+12. 4+2+1+13. 3+3+1+14. 3+2+2+15. 2+2+2+2So, 5 ways.Therefore, adding them up: 1 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 15. So, that confirms it. There are 15 partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts.Hence, the number of ways Henry's little brother can distribute the stickers is 15.Wait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, using the concept of combinations with repetition, but since the sheets are identical, that doesn't apply directly. The formula for combinations with repetition is C(n + k - 1, k - 1), which in this case would be C(8 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(11,3) = 165. But that's when the sheets are distinguishable, which they are not. So, that's not applicable here.Alternatively, if the sheets were distinguishable, the answer would be 165, but since they're identical, we have to consider partitions, which gives us 15. So, 15 is the correct answer.Therefore, after all this thinking and verifying, I'm confident that the number of ways is 15.**Final Answer**The number of ways is boxed{15}."},{"question":"Anya and Dania together weigh 82 kg, Dania and Tania - 74 kg, Tania and Vania - 75 kg, Vania and Mania - 65 kg, Mania and Anya - 62 kg.

The options are (A) 280, (B) 300, (C) 270, (D) 310, (E) 260. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, the numbers we're considering are five-digit numbers because they're between 10000 and 100000. So, each number is from 10000 up to 99999. That means we're dealing with numbers that have exactly five digits.Now, the question is asking how many of these five-digit numbers include the block of digits \\"178.\\" So, \\"178\\" has to appear somewhere in the number. That could be in positions 1-3, 2-4, or 3-5. Let me visualize the five-digit number as five slots: _ _ _ _ _. The block \\"178\\" can start at the first, second, or third position.So, I need to calculate the number of five-digit numbers where \\"178\\" appears starting at each of these positions and then make sure I don't double-count any numbers where \\"178\\" appears more than once.Let me break it down:1. **Case 1: \\"178\\" starts at the first position.**   - So, the number looks like 178 _ _. The first three digits are fixed as 1,7,8.   - The remaining two digits (positions 4 and 5) can be any digit from 0 to 9.   - So, for each of these two positions, there are 10 possibilities.   - Therefore, the number of such numbers is 10 * 10 = 100.2. **Case 2: \\"178\\" starts at the second position.**   - The number looks like _ 1 7 8 _.    - The first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it's a five-digit number, the first digit can't be 0).   - The fourth digit is fixed as 8, and the fifth digit can be any digit from 0 to 9.   - Wait, actually, in this case, the block is from position 2 to 4, so positions 2,3,4 are 1,7,8. So, position 1 can be 1-9, position 5 can be 0-9.   - Therefore, the number of such numbers is 9 (for position 1) * 10 (for position 5) = 90.3. **Case 3: \\"178\\" starts at the third position.**   - The number looks like _ _ 1 7 8.   - The first two digits can be any digits, but the first digit can't be 0.   - So, position 1: 1-9 (9 options), position 2: 0-9 (10 options).   - Positions 3,4,5 are fixed as 1,7,8.   - Therefore, the number of such numbers is 9 * 10 = 90.Now, adding up all these cases: 100 + 90 + 90 = 280. Hmm, that's one of the options, option A.But wait, I need to make sure I didn't double-count any numbers where \\"178\\" appears more than once. For example, a number like 178178 would have \\"178\\" starting at position 1 and again starting at position 4, but since we're dealing with five-digit numbers, can \\"178\\" appear more than once?Wait, in a five-digit number, the maximum overlap would be if \\"178\\" starts at position 1 and also starts at position 3. Let's see: If the number is 17817, then positions 1-3 are 178, and positions 3-5 are 817, which isn't 178. So, actually, in a five-digit number, can \\"178\\" appear twice?Let me check: If \\"178\\" starts at position 1, then the number is 178xx. If \\"178\\" also starts at position 3, then positions 3-5 must be 178. So, the number would have to be 178178, but that's a six-digit number. Since we're only dealing with five-digit numbers, it's impossible for \\"178\\" to appear twice. Therefore, there is no overlap, and we don't have to subtract any cases for double-counting.So, the total number is indeed 100 + 90 + 90 = 280. Therefore, the answer should be A) 280.Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes these combinatorial problems can be tricky.Another approach is to calculate the total number of five-digit numbers, which is 90000 (from 10000 to 99999). Then, subtract the number of five-digit numbers that do NOT contain the block \\"178\\" anywhere.But that might be more complicated because calculating the number without \\"178\\" could involve inclusion-exclusion as well. Maybe my initial approach is correct.Alternatively, let me think about the positions where \\"178\\" can occur.In a five-digit number, the block \\"178\\" can start at position 1, 2, or 3.- Starting at position 1: 178xx- Starting at position 2: x178x- Starting at position 3: xx178Each of these is distinct and non-overlapping in a five-digit number, as we saw earlier. So, the counts are 100, 90, and 90, totaling 280.Therefore, I think my initial answer is correct.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Let the function f(x)=2cos x(cos x+sqrt{3}sin x) (xinmathbb{R}).(1) Find the period of the function y=f(x) and its intervals of monotonic increase;(2) When xinleft[0, frac{pi}{2}right], find the maximum value of the function f(x).","answer":"Alright, so I've got this function here: f(x) = 2 cos x (cos x + sqrt(3) sin x). I need to find its period and the intervals where it's increasing. Then, for part (2), I have to find its maximum value when x is between 0 and pi/2. Hmm, okay, let's take it step by step.First, for part (1), the period. The function is built from cosine and sine terms, so I know that both cos x and sin x have a period of 2pi. But when functions are combined, sometimes the period can change. Let me see if I can rewrite f(x) in a simpler form to figure out its period.Looking at f(x) = 2 cos x (cos x + sqrt(3) sin x). Maybe I can expand this expression first. Let me multiply it out:f(x) = 2 cos x * cos x + 2 cos x * sqrt(3) sin x= 2 cos²x + 2 sqrt(3) cos x sin xOkay, so now I have f(x) = 2 cos²x + 2 sqrt(3) cos x sin x. Hmm, maybe I can use some trigonometric identities to simplify this.I remember that cos²x can be written as (1 + cos 2x)/2, and sin 2x is 2 sin x cos x. Let me try that.So, 2 cos²x becomes 2*(1 + cos 2x)/2 = 1 + cos 2x.And 2 sqrt(3) cos x sin x is sqrt(3)*2 sin x cos x, which is sqrt(3) sin 2x.So putting it all together, f(x) = 1 + cos 2x + sqrt(3) sin 2x.Alright, that's simpler. Now, f(x) is expressed as 1 + cos 2x + sqrt(3) sin 2x. This looks like a combination of sine and cosine functions with the same argument 2x. Maybe I can write this as a single sinusoidal function.I recall that A cos theta + B sin theta can be written as C cos(theta - phi), where C = sqrt(A² + B²) and tan phi = B/A. Let me apply that here.Here, A is 1 (the coefficient of cos 2x) and B is sqrt(3) (the coefficient of sin 2x). So, C = sqrt(1² + (sqrt(3))²) = sqrt(1 + 3) = sqrt(4) = 2.Then, tan phi = B/A = sqrt(3)/1 = sqrt(3). So phi is arctan(sqrt(3)). I remember that tan(pi/3) = sqrt(3), so phi = pi/3.Therefore, cos 2x + sqrt(3) sin 2x can be written as 2 cos(2x - pi/3). So, f(x) = 1 + 2 cos(2x - pi/3).Great, now f(x) is simplified to 1 + 2 cos(2x - pi/3). Now, to find the period of this function.The general form of a cosine function is A cos(Bx + C) + D, and its period is 2pi / |B|. In our case, B is 2, so the period is 2pi / 2 = pi. So, the period of f(x) is pi.That answers the first part of question (1): the period is pi.Now, for the intervals of monotonic increase. Hmm, okay, so I need to find where the function is increasing. To do that, I should find the derivative of f(x) and determine where it's positive.Given that f(x) = 1 + 2 cos(2x - pi/3), let's compute f'(x).f'(x) = derivative of 1 is 0, plus derivative of 2 cos(2x - pi/3). The derivative of cos(u) is -sin(u) * u', so:f'(x) = 2 * (-sin(2x - pi/3)) * 2 = -4 sin(2x - pi/3).So, f'(x) = -4 sin(2x - pi/3). To find where the function is increasing, we need f'(x) > 0.So, -4 sin(2x - pi/3) > 0.Divide both sides by -4 (remembering to flip the inequality sign):sin(2x - pi/3) < 0.So, sin(theta) < 0 when theta is in (pi + 2kpi, 2pi + 2kpi) for integers k.Let me set theta = 2x - pi/3. So, sin(theta) < 0 when theta is in (pi + 2kpi, 2pi + 2kpi).Therefore, 2x - pi/3 is in (pi + 2kpi, 2pi + 2kpi).Let me solve for x:Add pi/3 to all parts:2x is in (pi + pi/3 + 2kpi, 2pi + pi/3 + 2kpi)= (4pi/3 + 2kpi, 7pi/3 + 2kpi)Divide all parts by 2:x is in (2pi/3 + kpi, 7pi/6 + kpi)So, the intervals where f(x) is increasing are (2pi/3 + kpi, 7pi/6 + kpi) for integers k.But since the period is pi, we can describe the intervals within one period and then extend it periodically.Let me consider k = 0: x in (2pi/3, 7pi/6). But 7pi/6 is more than pi, so within the interval [0, pi], the increasing part is from 2pi/3 to pi, because 7pi/6 is beyond pi.Wait, actually, let me think again. Since the function has period pi, the behavior repeats every pi. So, in each interval of length pi, the function increases on (2pi/3, 7pi/6), but 7pi/6 is pi + pi/6, which is outside the first pi interval.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the intervals.Let me consider the general solution:sin(theta) < 0 when theta is in (pi + 2kpi, 2pi + 2kpi). So, theta = 2x - pi/3.So, 2x - pi/3 > pi + 2kpi and 2x - pi/3 < 2pi + 2kpi.Let me solve for x:First inequality:2x - pi/3 > pi + 2kpi2x > pi + pi/3 + 2kpi2x > 4pi/3 + 2kpix > 2pi/3 + kpiSecond inequality:2x - pi/3 < 2pi + 2kpi2x < 2pi + pi/3 + 2kpi2x < 7pi/3 + 2kpix < 7pi/6 + kpiSo, the solution is x in (2pi/3 + kpi, 7pi/6 + kpi) for integers k.But since the function has period pi, the behavior in each period is the same. So, in the interval [0, pi], the increasing part is from 2pi/3 to pi, because 7pi/6 is beyond pi.Wait, 7pi/6 is approximately 3.665, which is more than pi (approx 3.1416). So, within [0, pi], the increasing interval is (2pi/3, pi). Similarly, in the next period [pi, 2pi], the increasing interval would be (2pi/3 + pi, 7pi/6 + pi) = (5pi/3, 13pi/6), but 13pi/6 is more than 2pi, so within [pi, 2pi], the increasing interval is (5pi/3, 2pi).Wait, but 5pi/3 is approximately 5.235, which is less than 2pi (approx 6.283). So, in [pi, 2pi], the increasing interval is (5pi/3, 2pi). Hmm, okay.But since the function is periodic with period pi, it's sufficient to describe the increasing intervals within one period, say [0, pi], and then it repeats every pi.So, in [0, pi], f(x) is increasing on (2pi/3, pi). Similarly, in [pi, 2pi], it's increasing on (5pi/3, 2pi), and so on.Therefore, the intervals of monotonic increase are (2pi/3 + kpi, pi + kpi) for integers k. Wait, but 7pi/6 is more than pi, so actually, in terms of the period pi, the increasing interval is (2pi/3, pi) in each period.Wait, perhaps it's better to express it as (2pi/3 + kpi, pi + kpi) for all integers k. Because within each interval of length pi, the function increases from 2pi/3 to pi, then decreases from pi to 2pi/3 + pi, etc.Wait, maybe I should visualize the function.f(x) = 1 + 2 cos(2x - pi/3). So, it's a cosine function with amplitude 2, shifted vertically by 1, with a phase shift of pi/3 and frequency doubled.So, its period is pi, as we found. The derivative is f'(x) = -4 sin(2x - pi/3). So, the critical points occur where sin(2x - pi/3) = 0, which is at 2x - pi/3 = kpi, so x = (kpi + pi/3)/2 = kpi/2 + pi/6.So, critical points at x = pi/6, 2pi/3, 7pi/6, 5pi/3, etc.So, between these critical points, the function is either increasing or decreasing.Let me test the intervals:From x = pi/6 to x = 2pi/3: Let's pick x = pi/2.Compute f'(pi/2) = -4 sin(2*(pi/2) - pi/3) = -4 sin(pi - pi/3) = -4 sin(2pi/3) = -4*(sqrt(3)/2) = -2 sqrt(3) < 0. So, function is decreasing here.From x = 2pi/3 to x = 7pi/6: Let's pick x = pi.f'(pi) = -4 sin(2pi - pi/3) = -4 sin(5pi/3) = -4*(-sqrt(3)/2) = 2 sqrt(3) > 0. So, function is increasing here.From x = 7pi/6 to x = 5pi/3: Let's pick x = 3pi/2.f'(3pi/2) = -4 sin(3pi - pi/3) = -4 sin(8pi/3) = -4 sin(2pi/3) = -4*(sqrt(3)/2) = -2 sqrt(3) < 0. So, decreasing again.So, the function is increasing on intervals (2pi/3 + kpi, 7pi/6 + kpi), but since the period is pi, the increasing intervals within each period are (2pi/3, pi) and (5pi/3, 2pi), but wait, 5pi/3 is more than pi, so in terms of the period pi, it's (2pi/3, pi) in the first period, then (2pi/3 + pi, pi + pi) = (5pi/3, 2pi), but 5pi/3 is approximately 5.235, which is more than pi (3.1416), so in the next period, it's (5pi/3, 2pi). Hmm, but 2pi is the end of the second period.Wait, maybe it's better to express the increasing intervals as (2pi/3 + kpi, pi + kpi) for all integers k. Because in each interval of length pi, the function increases from 2pi/3 to pi, then decreases from pi to 2pi/3 + pi, which is 5pi/3, and so on.But wait, 2pi/3 + pi is 5pi/3, which is correct.So, in general, the function is increasing on intervals (2pi/3 + kpi, pi + kpi) for all integers k.But let me check for k = 0: (2pi/3, pi). For k = 1: (2pi/3 + pi, pi + pi) = (5pi/3, 2pi). For k = -1: (2pi/3 - pi, pi - pi) = (-pi/3, 0). So, yes, that makes sense.Therefore, the intervals of monotonic increase are (2pi/3 + kpi, pi + kpi) for all integers k.So, summarizing part (1): The period is pi, and the function is increasing on intervals (2pi/3 + kpi, pi + kpi) for all integers k.Now, moving on to part (2): When x is in [0, pi/2], find the maximum value of f(x).We have f(x) = 1 + 2 cos(2x - pi/3). Alternatively, we can use the original expression, but the simplified form might be easier.Since f(x) is continuous on [0, pi/2], it must attain its maximum on this interval. The maximum can occur either at a critical point inside the interval or at the endpoints.So, first, let's find the critical points by setting f'(x) = 0.We have f'(x) = -4 sin(2x - pi/3). Setting this equal to zero:-4 sin(2x - pi/3) = 0sin(2x - pi/3) = 0So, 2x - pi/3 = kpi2x = kpi + pi/3x = (kpi + pi/3)/2So, critical points at x = (kpi + pi/3)/2.We need to find x in [0, pi/2]. Let's find the values of k such that x is in [0, pi/2].For k = 0: x = (0 + pi/3)/2 = pi/6 ≈ 0.523, which is within [0, pi/2].For k = 1: x = (pi + pi/3)/2 = (4pi/3)/2 = 2pi/3 ≈ 2.094, which is more than pi/2 ≈ 1.571, so outside the interval.For k = -1: x = (-pi + pi/3)/2 = (-2pi/3)/2 = -pi/3 ≈ -1.047, which is negative, so outside the interval.Therefore, the only critical point in [0, pi/2] is x = pi/6.So, to find the maximum, we need to evaluate f(x) at x = 0, x = pi/6, and x = pi/2.Let's compute f(0):f(0) = 1 + 2 cos(2*0 - pi/3) = 1 + 2 cos(-pi/3) = 1 + 2*(1/2) = 1 + 1 = 2.f(pi/6):f(pi/6) = 1 + 2 cos(2*(pi/6) - pi/3) = 1 + 2 cos(pi/3 - pi/3) = 1 + 2 cos(0) = 1 + 2*1 = 3.f(pi/2):f(pi/2) = 1 + 2 cos(2*(pi/2) - pi/3) = 1 + 2 cos(pi - pi/3) = 1 + 2 cos(2pi/3) = 1 + 2*(-1/2) = 1 - 1 = 0.So, f(0) = 2, f(pi/6) = 3, f(pi/2) = 0.Therefore, the maximum value on [0, pi/2] is 3, occurring at x = pi/6.Wait, let me double-check the calculations.f(0): 2 cos(0)(cos 0 + sqrt(3) sin 0) = 2*1*(1 + 0) = 2. Correct.f(pi/6): 2 cos(pi/6)(cos(pi/6) + sqrt(3) sin(pi/6)).cos(pi/6) = sqrt(3)/2, sin(pi/6) = 1/2.So, f(pi/6) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)*(1/2)).Compute inside the brackets: sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3).So, f(pi/6) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*sqrt(3) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*sqrt(3) = 2*(3/2) = 3. Correct.f(pi/2): 2 cos(pi/2)(cos(pi/2) + sqrt(3) sin(pi/2)) = 2*0*(0 + sqrt(3)*1) = 0. Correct.So, yes, the maximum is indeed 3 at x = pi/6.Alternatively, using the simplified form f(x) = 1 + 2 cos(2x - pi/3), the maximum value of cos is 1, so maximum f(x) is 1 + 2*1 = 3. And this occurs when 2x - pi/3 = 2kpi, so x = (2kpi + pi/3)/2. For k=0, x=pi/6, which is within [0, pi/2]. So, that's consistent.Therefore, the maximum value is 3.So, summarizing part (2): The maximum value of f(x) on [0, pi/2] is 3.**Final Answer**(1) The period of the function is boxed{pi} and it is increasing on the intervals boxed{left( frac{2pi}{3} + kpi, pi + kpi right)} for all integers ( k ).(2) The maximum value of the function on the interval (left[0, frac{pi}{2}right]) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"The number of students in the small, medium, and large classes of a certain kindergarten are 90, 90, and 120, respectively.

For the first term, ((2x - 1)^2), I'll use the formula ((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2), which gives (4x^2 - 4x + 1).Next, for the second term, ((3x + 1)(3x - 1)), I'll apply the difference of squares formula, resulting in (9x^2 - 1).For the third term, (5x(x - 1)), I'll distribute the 5x to get (5x^2 - 5x).Now, I'll combine all the expanded terms: (4x^2 - 4x + 1 - 9x^2 + 1 + 5x^2 - 5x).Combining like terms, the (x^2) terms add up to (0x^2), the (x) terms combine to (-9x), and the constant terms sum to (2).

The expression is:[left( frac{1}{a+1} - frac{a+2}{a^2 - 1} cdot frac{a^2 - 2a + 1}{a^2 + 4a + 4} right) cdot (a + 2)]Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. First, I think I should simplify the expression inside the parentheses before dealing with the multiplication by ( (a + 2) ).Looking at the terms inside the parentheses, there are two main parts: ( frac{1}{a+1} ) and ( frac{a+2}{a^2 - 1} cdot frac{a^2 - 2a + 1}{a^2 + 4a + 4} ). I need to subtract the second part from the first.Let me write this out:[frac{1}{a+1} - left( frac{a+2}{a^2 - 1} cdot frac{a^2 - 2a + 1}{a^2 + 4a + 4} right)]I notice that all these denominators are quadratic or can be factored. Maybe factoring them will help simplify the expression.Starting with ( a^2 - 1 ), that's a difference of squares, so it factors into ( (a - 1)(a + 1) ).Next, ( a^2 - 2a + 1 ) looks like a perfect square trinomial. It factors into ( (a - 1)^2 ).Then, ( a^2 + 4a + 4 ) is also a perfect square trinomial. It factors into ( (a + 2)^2 ).So, substituting these factored forms back into the expression, we have:[frac{1}{a+1} - left( frac{a+2}{(a - 1)(a + 1)} cdot frac{(a - 1)^2}{(a + 2)^2} right)]Now, let me simplify the multiplication part:[frac{a+2}{(a - 1)(a + 1)} cdot frac{(a - 1)^2}{(a + 2)^2}]I can cancel out common factors here. The ( (a + 2) ) in the numerator cancels with one ( (a + 2) ) in the denominator, leaving ( 1 ) in the numerator and ( (a + 2) ) in the denominator. Similarly, the ( (a - 1) ) in the denominator cancels with one ( (a - 1) ) in the numerator, leaving ( (a - 1) ) in the numerator.So, simplifying, we get:[frac{1}{(a + 1)} cdot frac{(a - 1)}{(a + 2)}]Wait, hold on, let me double-check that. The original multiplication is:[frac{a+2}{(a - 1)(a + 1)} times frac{(a - 1)^2}{(a + 2)^2}]So, the ( (a + 2) ) cancels with one ( (a + 2) ) from the denominator, leaving ( 1 ) in the numerator and ( (a + 2) ) in the denominator. The ( (a - 1) ) in the denominator cancels with one ( (a - 1) ) from the numerator, leaving ( (a - 1) ) in the numerator.So, after canceling, it becomes:[frac{1}{(a + 1)} times frac{(a - 1)}{(a + 2)}]Which is:[frac{(a - 1)}{(a + 1)(a + 2)}]Okay, so the second term simplifies to ( frac{a - 1}{(a + 1)(a + 2)} ).Now, going back to the original expression inside the parentheses:[frac{1}{a + 1} - frac{a - 1}{(a + 1)(a + 2)}]To subtract these two fractions, they need a common denominator. The first term has denominator ( a + 1 ), and the second term has denominator ( (a + 1)(a + 2) ). So, the common denominator is ( (a + 1)(a + 2) ).I can rewrite the first term with this common denominator:[frac{1}{a + 1} = frac{(a + 2)}{(a + 1)(a + 2)}]So, now the expression becomes:[frac{(a + 2)}{(a + 1)(a + 2)} - frac{(a - 1)}{(a + 1)(a + 2)}]Now that the denominators are the same, I can subtract the numerators:[frac{(a + 2) - (a - 1)}{(a + 1)(a + 2)}]Simplifying the numerator:( (a + 2) - (a - 1) = a + 2 - a + 1 = 3 )So, the expression inside the parentheses simplifies to:[frac{3}{(a + 1)(a + 2)}]Now, going back to the entire original expression, we have this result multiplied by ( (a + 2) ):[left( frac{3}{(a + 1)(a + 2)} right) times (a + 2)]Here, the ( (a + 2) ) in the numerator cancels with the ( (a + 2) ) in the denominator:[frac{3}{(a + 1)}]So, the entire expression simplifies to ( frac{3}{a + 1} ).Now, we need to evaluate this at ( a = 2 ):[frac{3}{2 + 1} = frac{3}{3} = 1]Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Factored all denominators correctly:   - ( a^2 - 1 = (a - 1)(a + 1) )   - ( a^2 - 2a + 1 = (a - 1)^2 )   - ( a^2 + 4a + 4 = (a + 2)^2 )   2. Simplified the multiplication:   - Canceled one ( (a + 2) ) and one ( (a - 1) ), resulting in ( frac{a - 1}{(a + 1)(a + 2)} )   3. Subtracted the two fractions by finding a common denominator:   - Converted ( frac{1}{a + 1} ) to ( frac{a + 2}{(a + 1)(a + 2)} )   - Subtracted numerators: ( (a + 2) - (a - 1) = 3 )   4. Multiplied by ( (a + 2) ), which canceled out, leaving ( frac{3}{a + 1} )   5. Plugged in ( a = 2 ), resulting in ( 1 )Everything seems to check out.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, the first equation is ( x y = 6 ). That seems straightforward. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the second equation. Let me try that.From the first equation, I can solve for ( y ) in terms of ( x ):( y = frac{6}{x} )Okay, so now I can substitute this expression for ( y ) into the second equation. Let's write out the second equation again:( x^{2} y + x y^{2} + x + y = 63 )Substituting ( y = frac{6}{x} ) into this, we get:( x^{2} cdot frac{6}{x} + x cdot left( frac{6}{x} right)^2 + x + frac{6}{x} = 63 )Let me simplify each term step by step.First term: ( x^{2} cdot frac{6}{x} ). That simplifies to ( 6x ).Second term: ( x cdot left( frac{6}{x} right)^2 ). Let's compute that:( x cdot frac{36}{x^2} = frac{36}{x} )Third term is just ( x ).Fourth term is ( frac{6}{x} ).So putting it all together, the equation becomes:( 6x + frac{36}{x} + x + frac{6}{x} = 63 )Now, let's combine like terms.First, the terms with ( x ): ( 6x + x = 7x )Then, the terms with ( frac{1}{x} ): ( frac{36}{x} + frac{6}{x} = frac{42}{x} )So now the equation is:( 7x + frac{42}{x} = 63 )Hmm, this looks manageable. Let me write it as:( 7x + frac{42}{x} = 63 )I can factor out a 7 from the left side:( 7 left( x + frac{6}{x} right) = 63 )Divide both sides by 7:( x + frac{6}{x} = 9 )Okay, so now I have:( x + frac{6}{x} = 9 )This is a quadratic in disguise. Let me multiply both sides by ( x ) to eliminate the denominator:( x^2 + 6 = 9x )Bring all terms to one side:( x^2 - 9x + 6 = 0 )Now, I have a quadratic equation in standard form. Let's try to solve for ( x ) using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is:( x^2 - 9x + 6 = 0 )So, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -9 ), ( c = 6 ).The quadratic formula is:( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Plugging in the values:( x = frac{-(-9) pm sqrt{(-9)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 6}}{2 cdot 1} )Simplify:( x = frac{9 pm sqrt{81 - 24}}{2} )( x = frac{9 pm sqrt{57}}{2} )So, the solutions for ( x ) are ( frac{9 + sqrt{57}}{2} ) and ( frac{9 - sqrt{57}}{2} ).Now, since ( y = frac{6}{x} ), let's find the corresponding ( y ) values.First, for ( x = frac{9 + sqrt{57}}{2} ):( y = frac{6}{frac{9 + sqrt{57}}{2}} = frac{6 cdot 2}{9 + sqrt{57}} = frac{12}{9 + sqrt{57}} )To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by ( 9 - sqrt{57} ):( y = frac{12 cdot (9 - sqrt{57})}{(9 + sqrt{57})(9 - sqrt{57})} )Compute the denominator:( (9)^2 - (sqrt{57})^2 = 81 - 57 = 24 )So,( y = frac{12 cdot (9 - sqrt{57})}{24} = frac{12}{24} cdot (9 - sqrt{57}) = frac{1}{2} cdot (9 - sqrt{57}) = frac{9 - sqrt{57}}{2} )Similarly, for ( x = frac{9 - sqrt{57}}{2} ):( y = frac{6}{frac{9 - sqrt{57}}{2}} = frac{12}{9 - sqrt{57}} )Again, rationalize the denominator:( y = frac{12 cdot (9 + sqrt{57})}{(9 - sqrt{57})(9 + sqrt{57})} = frac{12 cdot (9 + sqrt{57})}{24} = frac{12}{24} cdot (9 + sqrt{57}) = frac{1}{2} cdot (9 + sqrt{57}) = frac{9 + sqrt{57}}{2} )So, the solutions are:( left( frac{9 + sqrt{57}}{2}, frac{9 - sqrt{57}}{2} right) ) and ( left( frac{9 - sqrt{57}}{2}, frac{9 + sqrt{57}}{2} right) )Now, the problem asks for ( x^2 + y^2 ). Let's compute that.First, note that ( x + y ) can be found from the equation ( x + frac{6}{x} = 9 ), which we had earlier. Wait, actually, ( x + y ) is equal to 9 because:From ( x + frac{6}{x} = 9 ), and since ( y = frac{6}{x} ), this means ( x + y = 9 ).So, ( x + y = 9 ).Also, we know that ( x y = 6 ).We can use the identity:( x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2 x y )Plugging in the known values:( x^2 + y^2 = 9^2 - 2 cdot 6 = 81 - 12 = 69 )So, ( x^2 + y^2 = 69 ).Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify it another way to make sure.Alternatively, let's compute ( x^2 + y^2 ) using the expressions for ( x ) and ( y ).Take ( x = frac{9 + sqrt{57}}{2} ) and ( y = frac{9 - sqrt{57}}{2} ).Compute ( x^2 ):( left( frac{9 + sqrt{57}}{2} right)^2 = frac{(9)^2 + 2 cdot 9 cdot sqrt{57} + (sqrt{57})^2}{4} = frac{81 + 18 sqrt{57} + 57}{4} = frac{138 + 18 sqrt{57}}{4} = frac{69 + 9 sqrt{57}}{2} )Compute ( y^2 ):( left( frac{9 - sqrt{57}}{2} right)^2 = frac{(9)^2 - 2 cdot 9 cdot sqrt{57} + (sqrt{57})^2}{4} = frac{81 - 18 sqrt{57} + 57}{4} = frac{138 - 18 sqrt{57}}{4} = frac{69 - 9 sqrt{57}}{2} )Now, add ( x^2 + y^2 ):( frac{69 + 9 sqrt{57}}{2} + frac{69 - 9 sqrt{57}}{2} = frac{69 + 9 sqrt{57} + 69 - 9 sqrt{57}}{2} = frac{138}{2} = 69 )Yes, that confirms it. So, ( x^2 + y^2 = 69 ).I think that's solid. I approached it two ways: once using the identity with ( x + y ) and ( x y ), and another by directly computing the squares. Both gave me the same result, so I feel confident that 69 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( x^{2} + y^{2} ) is boxed{69}."},{"question":"Given a circle and a point outside it, from this point we travel along a closed broken line consisting of tangent line segments to the circle, and we end the path at the starting point.

Let me try to wrap my head around it. The problem says: Given a circle and a point outside it, from this point we travel along a closed broken line consisting of tangent line segments to the circle, and we end the path at the starting point. The segments where we approach the center of the circle are taken with a positive sign, while the segments where we move away from the center are taken with a negative sign. We need to prove that for any such path, the sum of the lengths of the segments, taken with these signs, equals zero.Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, we have a circle, let's say with center O, and a point P outside the circle. From P, we draw a closed broken line made up of tangent segments to the circle. Each segment is a tangent, so each time we touch the circle, we switch direction, right? And since it's a closed path, we end up back at P.Now, each segment is assigned a sign: positive if we're moving towards the center O, negative if moving away. We need to show that when we add up all these signed lengths, the total is zero.First, I should visualize this. Imagine the circle, point P outside. From P, we draw a tangent to the circle, touch it at some point, then from there draw another tangent, and so on, until we return to P. Each tangent segment alternates between approaching and moving away from the center? Or maybe not necessarily alternate, but each segment has a direction relative to O.Wait, actually, each tangent segment is either approaching or moving away from O. So, depending on the direction of the segment relative to the center, we assign a sign. So, if the segment is going towards O, it's positive; if it's going away, it's negative.But how do we determine whether a segment is approaching or moving away from O? Since each segment is a tangent, it's a straight line touching the circle at exactly one point. So, the direction of the segment relative to O would depend on the angle between the segment and the line OP, where P is the external point.Let me think. If we have a tangent from P to the circle, the tangent will touch the circle at a point T. The line PT is a tangent, and OT is perpendicular to PT. So, OT is the radius at the point of tangency, and PT is the tangent.So, in this case, the direction from P to T is a tangent. Now, is PT moving towards or away from O? Well, since P is outside the circle, and T is on the circle, the segment PT goes from outside to the circle. So, relative to O, is PT moving towards O or away?Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors. If we consider the vector from P to T, is it pointing towards O or away? Hmm, not necessarily. Because P is outside, and T is on the circle, so the vector PT is going from P to T, which is towards the circle, but not necessarily towards O.Wait, maybe I should think about the direction relative to the center. So, if we have a segment, say from A to B, which is a tangent to the circle at point C. Then, the direction from A to B is either towards O or away from O. So, if the vector AB is pointing towards O, we take it as positive; otherwise, negative.But how do we determine that? Maybe we can compute the dot product of AB and the vector from the midpoint of AB to O. If the dot product is positive, then AB is pointing towards O; if negative, away.Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the angle between AB and the line connecting the midpoint of AB to O. If the angle is acute, then AB is pointing towards O; if obtuse, away.But maybe that's complicating things. Let me think of another approach.Wait, the problem is about the sum of the lengths with signs. So, perhaps we can model this as a vector sum. If we assign each segment a vector with magnitude equal to its length and direction according to whether it's approaching or moving away from O, then the sum of these vectors should be zero.But actually, the problem is about the algebraic sum, not the vector sum. So, we're just adding scalars with signs, not vectors. So, perhaps it's a different approach.Wait, but if we think of each segment as contributing a scalar value, positive or negative, depending on direction relative to O, then the total sum is zero. So, maybe we can relate this to some invariant or use properties of tangents.I remember that for a point outside a circle, the lengths of the two tangents from that point to the circle are equal. So, if we have two tangent segments from P to the circle, their lengths are equal. But in this case, the path is a closed broken line, so we have multiple tangent segments.Wait, maybe we can think of the path as a polygonal chain, where each segment is a tangent. Since it's a closed path, the number of segments must be even? Or maybe not necessarily, but each tangent must be paired in some way.Alternatively, perhaps we can use some form of Green's theorem or integral around a closed loop, but that might be overcomplicating.Wait, another thought: if we consider the potential function, like the distance from O, then moving towards O would decrease the distance, and moving away would increase it. But since we start and end at P, the total change in distance should be zero. But is that the case?Wait, hold on. The distance from O to P is fixed, right? So, if we start at P, move along a path, and come back to P, the net change in distance from O is zero. But how does that relate to the sum of the signed lengths?Hmm, maybe not directly. Because each segment is a tangent, so each segment is moving along a direction that's tangent to the circle. So, the movement along each segment doesn't change the distance to O? Wait, no, because the segments are not necessarily radial. So, moving along a tangent segment would change the direction relative to O, but not necessarily the distance.Wait, no, actually, if you move along a tangent to the circle, the distance to the center O remains constant along that tangent. Because the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. So, if you're moving along the tangent, your distance to O doesn't change. But in our case, the segments are not necessarily along the tangent from the point of contact, but from an external point.Wait, no, the segments are tangent to the circle, but they start from an external point, not necessarily from the point of contact. So, each segment is a tangent from some external point to the circle.Wait, actually, no. The broken line is made up of tangent segments to the circle. So, each segment is a tangent to the circle, but they connect to form a closed loop. So, each segment is a tangent, but the endpoints of the segments are points outside the circle, except for the points where they touch the circle.Wait, no, actually, each segment is a tangent, so each segment must touch the circle at exactly one point. So, the broken line is a polygonal chain where each edge is a tangent to the circle. So, each vertex of the broken line is a point outside the circle, connected by tangent segments.So, starting from P, we go along a tangent to the circle, touch it at T1, then from T1, we go along another tangent to another point T2, and so on, until we return to P.Wait, but if each segment is a tangent, then each segment must start from a point outside the circle and touch the circle at exactly one point. So, the broken line is made up of such tangent segments, each connecting two external points via a tangent.Wait, but if it's a closed broken line, then the last segment must connect back to P, which is the starting point. So, the path is a polygonal chain where each edge is a tangent to the circle, and the vertices are external points, except for the points of tangency.But in that case, each segment is a tangent from one external point to another, touching the circle at one point in between.Wait, actually, no. Each segment is a tangent, but the endpoints of the segments are the external points. So, for example, from P, we draw a tangent to the circle, which touches at T1, then from T1, we draw another tangent to another external point Q, then from Q, another tangent to T2, and so on, until we return to P.Wait, but if each segment is a tangent, then each segment must start and end at external points, with the segment itself being a tangent to the circle.But in that case, each segment is a tangent from one external point to another, touching the circle at one point in between.But in that case, the broken line would consist of segments that are each tangents from one external point to another, with each segment touching the circle once.But then, the path is a closed loop, so the number of segments must be even? Or maybe not necessarily.Wait, perhaps I need to think about the reflection property of tangents.I remember that for a point outside a circle, the two tangent segments to the circle have equal lengths. So, if you have a point P outside the circle, and two tangents PT1 and PT2, then PT1 = PT2.But in our case, the path is a closed broken line, so it's a polygonal chain where each edge is a tangent. So, perhaps each time we leave a point, we have two choices for the tangent, but since it's a closed path, we must alternate in some way.Wait, maybe we can model this as a graph, where each external point is connected via tangent segments, and the path is a cycle in this graph.But perhaps that's overcomplicating.Wait, another idea: since each tangent segment has a direction relative to O, maybe we can assign a vector to each segment, pointing in the direction of the segment, and then the sum of these vectors is zero because it's a closed path.But the problem is about the sum of the lengths with signs, not the vector sum. So, perhaps we can relate the scalar signed lengths to something else.Wait, maybe we can think of each segment as contributing a certain amount of \\"work\\" done towards or away from O. So, if we move towards O, we're doing positive work, and moving away, negative work. The total work done over the closed path would be zero because we end up where we started.But how does that translate to the sum of the lengths with signs?Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of power of a point. The power of point P with respect to the circle is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from P to the circle. So, for any tangent segment from P, its length squared is equal to the power of P.But in our case, the path consists of multiple tangent segments, each from different external points. So, the power of each external point with respect to the circle is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from that point to the circle.But how does that help with the sum of the signed lengths?Wait, maybe if we consider the sum of the signed lengths, we can relate it to the derivative of the power or something. But I'm not sure.Wait, another thought: if we consider the potential function as the distance from O, then moving along a direction towards O would decrease the potential, and moving away would increase it. But since the path is closed, the total change in potential is zero. However, the sum of the signed lengths isn't exactly the total change in potential, because each segment's contribution depends on the component of the movement towards or away from O.Wait, actually, that might be a way to model it. If we think of each segment as contributing a change in potential, which is the component of the segment's length in the direction towards or away from O. So, the total change in potential over the closed path would be zero, because we start and end at the same point. Therefore, the sum of these contributions should be zero.But the problem is about the sum of the lengths with signs, not the sum of the components. So, perhaps it's not directly applicable.Wait, but maybe we can think of each segment's contribution as the projection of its length onto the radial direction (towards or away from O). So, if we denote the angle between the segment and the radial direction at its midpoint, then the projection would be length * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the segment and the radial direction.But the problem states that the sign is determined by whether we're approaching or moving away from O. So, if the segment is moving towards O, it's positive; otherwise, negative. So, perhaps the projection is exactly the signed length as defined.But then, the sum of these projections over the closed path should be zero, because the net displacement is zero. So, the sum of the projections equals zero.But wait, the problem is about the sum of the lengths with signs, not the sum of the projections. So, unless the projection equals the signed length, which would only be the case if the segments are aligned with the radial direction, which they are not.Wait, no, the projection is length * cos(theta), which is not the same as the signed length. So, perhaps that's not the right approach.Wait, maybe I need to think about the geometry more carefully.Let me consider two consecutive segments in the broken line. Suppose we start at point A, go along a tangent to the circle at point T1, then from T1, go along another tangent to point B.Now, the first segment is AT1, and the second is T1B. Each of these segments is a tangent to the circle.Now, let's consider the direction of each segment relative to O. For segment AT1, is it moving towards O or away? Similarly for T1B.Wait, since AT1 is a tangent from A to the circle, and T1 is the point of tangency, the segment AT1 is moving from A to T1, which is towards the circle. But relative to O, is it moving towards or away?Hmm, perhaps we can compute the angle between AT1 and the line OA. If the angle is acute, then AT1 is moving towards O; if obtuse, away.But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to tell. Maybe we can use some properties of tangents.Wait, another idea: for any tangent segment from a point to the circle, the length can be expressed in terms of the distance from the point to O and the radius of the circle.Specifically, if we have a point A outside the circle with center O and radius r, then the length of the tangent from A to the circle is sqrt(|OA|^2 - r^2). So, all tangent segments from A have the same length.But in our case, the segments are from different points, so their lengths can vary.Wait, but each segment is a tangent, so each has a length equal to sqrt(|OP|^2 - r^2), where P is the external point for that segment.But since the external points vary along the path, the lengths can be different.Wait, but perhaps we can consider the sum of the signed lengths as a telescoping sum.Wait, let me think about the contributions of each segment. Each segment is a tangent from one external point to another, touching the circle at one point.So, suppose we have a segment from A to B, tangent at T. Then, the length of AB is equal to the length of the tangent from A to T, which is sqrt(|OA|^2 - r^2), and similarly from B to T, which is sqrt(|OB|^2 - r^2). But wait, no, AB is a single tangent segment, so actually, AB is equal to the length of the tangent from A to the circle, which is sqrt(|OA|^2 - r^2). Similarly, the next segment BC would be sqrt(|OB|^2 - r^2), and so on.But in our case, each segment is a tangent from one external point to another, so the length of each segment is the length of the tangent from the starting point to the circle.Wait, but in reality, each segment is a tangent from the starting point to the circle, but the endpoint is another external point. So, the length of each segment is the length of the tangent from the starting point to the circle, but the endpoint is another external point, which is also connected via a tangent.Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think about the contributions of each segment in terms of their approach or departure from O.Let me consider the direction of each segment. If a segment is moving towards O, it's positive; otherwise, negative. So, for each segment, we can think of it as contributing +length or -length to the total sum.Now, if we can show that for every segment moving towards O, there's a corresponding segment moving away with the same length, then their contributions would cancel out, leading to a total sum of zero.But how do we know that? Because the path is closed, so perhaps for every approach, there's an equal departure.Wait, but the path is a closed broken line made up of tangent segments. So, each time we approach the circle, we must eventually move away to complete the loop.But does that necessarily mean that the lengths are equal? Not necessarily, unless there's some symmetry.Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that the power of a point with respect to a circle is equal for all tangents from that point. So, for any external point, the lengths of the two tangents to the circle are equal.But in our case, each segment is a single tangent from one external point to another, so the lengths can vary.Wait, but maybe if we consider the entire path, the contributions from each segment can be paired in such a way that their signed lengths cancel out.Alternatively, perhaps we can use induction. Suppose the path has n segments. For n=2, it's just two tangent segments forming a digon, but that's degenerate. For n=3, a triangle, but with each side tangent to the circle.Wait, but a triangle with all sides tangent to a circle is a tangential polygon, which has an incircle. But in our case, the circle is fixed, and the polygon is circumscribed about the circle.Wait, but in that case, the lengths of the sides are related to the distances from the vertices to the points of tangency.Wait, in a tangential polygon, the lengths of the sides are equal to the sums of the tangent lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency.But I'm not sure how that helps here.Wait, another idea: since each segment is a tangent, the angle between the segment and the radius at the point of tangency is 90 degrees. So, perhaps we can use some trigonometric relationships.Suppose we have a segment AB, tangent to the circle at T. Then, OT is perpendicular to AB. So, triangle OTA is a right triangle, with OT = r, OA = distance from O to A, and AT = length of the tangent from A to T.So, we have |AT| = sqrt(|OA|^2 - r^2).Similarly, for segment BC, tangent at T', we have |BT'| = sqrt(|OB|^2 - r^2).But how does this relate to the direction towards or away from O?Wait, maybe we can think of the projection of each segment onto the line connecting its midpoint to O. If the projection is positive, it's moving towards O; if negative, away.But again, this seems complicated.Wait, perhaps instead of looking at each segment individually, we can consider the entire path and use some integral or geometric property.Wait, another thought: if we consider the path as a closed loop, then the integral of the unit vector tangent to the path dotted with the radial unit vector should be zero, because the net displacement is zero.But again, this is about vector integrals, not scalar sums.Wait, maybe I need to think about the problem differently. Let's consider the sum S = sum (±|segment|), where the sign is positive if the segment is moving towards O, negative otherwise.We need to show that S = 0.Suppose we can assign to each segment a vector whose magnitude is |segment| and direction is towards or away from O, then S is the algebraic sum of these vectors along the radial direction.But since the path is closed, the total displacement is zero, so the sum of the radial components must be zero. Therefore, S = 0.Wait, is that correct? Because the displacement is zero, the sum of the radial components of the segments must be zero. But the problem is about the sum of the lengths with signs, not the sum of the radial components.Wait, but if each segment's contribution to the radial direction is its length times the cosine of the angle between the segment and the radial direction, then the sum of these projections is zero. But the problem is about the sum of the lengths with signs, which is different.Unless, in this specific case, the angle between each segment and the radial direction is such that the sign is determined by the direction, and the magnitude is the full length. But that would only be the case if the segments are aligned with the radial direction, which they are not.Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.If we have a segment AB, tangent to the circle at T. Then, the direction of AB is perpendicular to OT. So, the angle between AB and OT is 90 degrees. Therefore, the projection of AB onto OT is zero. So, the radial component of AB is zero.Wait, that's interesting. So, if each segment is a tangent, then its projection onto the radial direction at the point of tangency is zero. So, the radial component of each segment is zero.But in our case, the sign is determined by the direction relative to O, not necessarily at the point of tangency. So, perhaps the projection of each segment onto the radial direction from its midpoint is not zero.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again.Wait, let's think about the entire path. Since it's a closed loop, the total displacement is zero. Therefore, the sum of all the segments as vectors is zero. So, if we can express each segment as a vector, then the sum is zero.But the problem is about the sum of the lengths with signs, not the vector sum. So, unless we can relate the signed lengths to the vector sum, it's not directly applicable.Wait, but perhaps if we can show that the sum of the signed lengths is equal to the sum of the projections of the vectors onto some direction, then since the vector sum is zero, the projection sum is also zero.But I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: consider the potential function as the distance from O. Then, moving along a segment, the change in potential is the component of the segment in the radial direction. So, the total change over the closed path is zero. Therefore, the sum of the radial components of the segments is zero.But the problem is about the sum of the lengths with signs, not the sum of the radial components. So, unless the radial component equals the signed length, which would only be the case if the segments are aligned radially, which they are not.Wait, but perhaps the signed length is equal to the radial component. Let me see.If a segment is moving towards O, its signed length is positive, and its radial component is positive. If it's moving away, the signed length is negative, and the radial component is negative. So, in that case, the sum of the signed lengths would equal the sum of the radial components.But wait, the radial component is length * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the segment and the radial direction. So, unless cos(theta) is either +1 or -1, which would mean the segment is aligned radially, the radial component is not equal to the signed length.But in our case, the segments are tangents, so they are perpendicular to the radial direction at the point of tangency. So, the angle between the segment and the radial direction at the point of tangency is 90 degrees, so cos(theta) is zero. Therefore, the radial component at the point of tangency is zero.But the problem is about the direction relative to O, not necessarily at the point of tangency. So, perhaps the radial component is not zero.Wait, maybe I need to think of the direction of each segment relative to O, not at the point of tangency.Wait, let me consider a segment AB, which is a tangent to the circle at T. The direction of AB is such that OT is perpendicular to AB. So, the direction of AB is perpendicular to OT.But the direction relative to O is not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, because O is the center, and AB is a tangent at T, so AB is perpendicular to OT, but not necessarily to the line from O to the midpoint of AB or something.Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw a diagram mentally.Imagine the circle with center O, and a tangent segment AB touching the circle at T. So, OT is perpendicular to AB. Now, the direction of AB is such that it's moving from A to B, which is along AB. The direction relative to O is whether AB is moving towards O or away from O.But since AB is a tangent, and OT is perpendicular to AB, the direction of AB is tangential to the circle, not radial. So, the movement along AB doesn't have a radial component at the point T, but the entire segment AB has some direction relative to O.Wait, perhaps the key is that each tangent segment has zero radial component at the point of tangency, but the entire segment may have some radial component depending on the position of A and B.Wait, but if we consider the entire segment AB, which is a tangent at T, then the direction of AB is such that it's moving from A to B, which is a point outside the circle. So, the direction of AB is from A to B, which is a point outside, so the segment AB is moving away from A, but A is already outside.Wait, this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a specific example.Let me consider a simple case where the broken line is just two tangent segments forming a digon. Wait, but a digon is degenerate. Maybe a triangle, but with each side tangent to the circle.Wait, actually, a triangle can't have all sides tangent to a circle unless it's a tangential polygon, which has an incircle. But in that case, the lengths of the sides are related to the distances from the vertices to the points of tangency.But in our case, the circle is fixed, and the polygon is circumscribed about the circle. So, each side is a tangent to the circle.Wait, but in that case, the lengths of the sides are equal to the sums of the tangent lengths from the vertices.Wait, but in our problem, the broken line is made up of tangent segments, but it's not necessarily a polygon. It's a closed broken line, so it can have any number of segments.Wait, another idea: since each segment is a tangent, and the path is closed, maybe we can use the fact that the total rotation around the circle is zero. So, each tangent segment contributes some angle, and the total sum of angles is zero.But I'm not sure how that relates to the sum of the lengths.Wait, perhaps I need to think about the problem in terms of complex numbers or coordinates.Let me assign coordinates to make it concrete. Let me place the circle at the origin, with radius r. Let the external point P be at (d, 0), where d > r.Now, from P, we draw a tangent to the circle. The tangent points can be calculated. The tangent from P to the circle will touch the circle at points (r^2/d, ±r*sqrt(1 - (r/d)^2)).So, the tangent points are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.Now, suppose we draw a tangent from P to the upper tangent point T1, then from T1, draw another tangent to another external point Q, and so on, until we return to P.But this seems too specific. Maybe I can generalize.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the sum of the signed lengths as a telescoping sum.Wait, let's think about the contributions of each segment. Each segment is a tangent from one external point to another, touching the circle at one point.Suppose we have a segment from A to B, tangent at T. Then, the length of AB is equal to the length of the tangent from A to T, which is sqrt(|OA|^2 - r^2). Similarly, the length from B to the next point would be sqrt(|OB|^2 - r^2).But how does the sign come into play?Wait, maybe the key is that for each segment, the signed length is equal to the difference in some potential function between the endpoints.Wait, if we define a function f(P) = |OP|, the distance from O to P, then moving from A to B along a tangent segment, the change in f is f(B) - f(A). But the segment AB is a tangent, so the direction of AB is such that the change in f is related to the component of AB in the radial direction.But since AB is a tangent, the radial component at T is zero, but the overall change in f from A to B is f(B) - f(A).Wait, but the problem is about the sum of the signed lengths, not the sum of the changes in f.Wait, unless the signed length is equal to the change in f. But that would only be the case if the segment is aligned radially, which it's not.Wait, but perhaps the signed length is proportional to the change in f. Let me see.If we move from A to B along a tangent segment, the change in distance from O is f(B) - f(A). The signed length would be +|AB| if moving towards O, -|AB| if moving away.But the actual change in f is f(B) - f(A) = |OB| - |OA|.So, if we have a segment AB, the signed length is sgn(|OB| - |OA|) * |AB|.But the problem defines the sign based on the direction of the segment relative to O, not based on the change in distance.Wait, actually, maybe they are related. If moving towards O, |OB| < |OA|, so the change is negative, and the signed length is positive. Wait, no, if moving towards O, the segment is directed towards O, so the change in distance is negative, but the signed length is positive. So, the signed length is - (f(B) - f(A)).Wait, let me think. If moving towards O, the distance decreases, so f(B) - f(A) is negative. If the signed length is positive when moving towards O, then the signed length would be equal to - (f(B) - f(A)).Similarly, if moving away, f(B) - f(A) is positive, and the signed length is negative, so again, signed length = - (f(B) - f(A)).Therefore, the signed length of segment AB is equal to - (f(B) - f(A)).Therefore, the sum of the signed lengths over the entire path would be the sum over all segments of - (f(B) - f(A)).But since the path is closed, starting and ending at P, the total sum would be - (f(P) - f(P)) = 0.Wait, that seems promising.Let me formalize this.Let the broken line be a sequence of points: P = A0, A1, A2, ..., An = P, where each segment AiAi+1 is a tangent to the circle.For each segment AiAi+1, define the signed length as +|AiAi+1| if moving towards O, and -|AiAi+1| if moving away.As established earlier, the signed length of segment AiAi+1 is equal to - (f(Ai+1) - f(Ai)), where f(A) = |OA|.Therefore, the total sum S = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [ - (f(Ai+1) - f(Ai)) ].This is a telescoping sum:S = - [ (f(A1) - f(A0)) + (f(A2) - f(A1)) + ... + (f(An) - f(An-1)) ) ]S = - [ f(An) - f(A0) ]But since An = A0 = P, we have f(An) = f(A0), so S = - [ f(P) - f(P) ] = 0.Therefore, the sum of the signed lengths is zero.Wait, that seems to solve the problem!So, the key idea is that the signed length of each segment is equal to the negative change in the distance from O. Therefore, summing over all segments in the closed path results in a telescoping sum that cancels out, leaving zero.Therefore, the sum of the lengths with the given signs equals zero."},{"question":"For a finite sequence (P = left(p_1, p_2, cdots, p_nright)), the Cesaro sum (named after the mathematician Cesaro) is defined as (frac{1}{n}(S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_n)), where (S_k = p_1 + p_2 + cdots + p_k) for (1 leq k leq n).

I need to figure out the Cesaro sum of a new sequence that's formed by adding a 1 at the beginning of an existing sequence. The original sequence has 99 terms, and its Cesaro sum is 1000. The new sequence will have 100 terms, starting with 1 followed by the original 99 terms. The question is asking for the Cesaro sum of this new sequence, and the options are A. 990, B. 991, C. 992, D. 993.First, let me make sure I understand what a Cesaro sum is. The problem defines it as the average of the partial sums of the sequence. For a sequence ( P = (p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n) ), the Cesaro sum is ( frac{1}{n}(S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_n) ), where each ( S_k = p_1 + p_2 + cdots + p_k ) for ( 1 leq k leq n ).So, for the original sequence with 99 terms, the Cesaro sum is 1000. That means:[frac{1}{99}(S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_{99}) = 1000]Therefore, the sum of the partial sums ( S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_{99} ) is ( 99 times 1000 = 99,000 ).Now, the new sequence is ( (1, p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{99}) ), which has 100 terms. Let's denote this new sequence as ( Q = (q_1, q_2, ldots, q_{100}) ), where ( q_1 = 1 ), ( q_2 = p_1 ), ( q_3 = p_2 ), and so on up to ( q_{100} = p_{99} ).We need to find the Cesaro sum of this new sequence ( Q ). That means we need to compute:[frac{1}{100}(T_1 + T_2 + cdots + T_{100})]where each ( T_k = q_1 + q_2 + cdots + q_k ) for ( 1 leq k leq 100 ).Let me write out the partial sums ( T_k ) for the new sequence ( Q ):- ( T_1 = q_1 = 1 )- ( T_2 = q_1 + q_2 = 1 + p_1 )- ( T_3 = q_1 + q_2 + q_3 = 1 + p_1 + p_2 )- ...- ( T_{100} = q_1 + q_2 + cdots + q_{100} = 1 + p_1 + p_2 + cdots + p_{99} )Notice that for ( k geq 2 ), ( T_k = 1 + S_{k-1} ), where ( S_{k-1} ) is the partial sum of the original sequence ( P ) up to term ( k-1 ). For ( k = 1 ), ( T_1 = 1 ).Therefore, the sum ( T_1 + T_2 + cdots + T_{100} ) can be written as:[T_1 + (T_2 + T_3 + cdots + T_{100}) = 1 + sum_{k=2}^{100} T_k = 1 + sum_{k=2}^{100} (1 + S_{k-1})]Let me compute this step by step.First, let's compute the sum ( sum_{k=2}^{100} (1 + S_{k-1}) ). This can be split into two separate sums:[sum_{k=2}^{100} 1 + sum_{k=2}^{100} S_{k-1}]The first sum is straightforward: it's adding 1 a total of ( 100 - 1 = 99 ) times. So, that sum is 99.The second sum is ( sum_{k=2}^{100} S_{k-1} ). Let's change the index to make it easier. Let ( m = k - 1 ). When ( k = 2 ), ( m = 1 ); when ( k = 100 ), ( m = 99 ). So, this sum becomes ( sum_{m=1}^{99} S_m ).But from the original problem, we know that ( sum_{m=1}^{99} S_m = 99,000 ). So, that sum is 99,000.Therefore, putting it all together:[sum_{k=2}^{100} (1 + S_{k-1}) = 99 + 99,000 = 99,099]Now, going back to the total sum ( T_1 + T_2 + cdots + T_{100} ):[1 + 99,099 = 99,100]So, the sum of all the partial sums ( T_1 ) through ( T_{100} ) is 99,100.Therefore, the Cesaro sum for the new sequence ( Q ) is:[frac{99,100}{100} = 991]Hmm, so that would be option B. 991.Wait, let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, I considered the original sequence's Cesaro sum, which is 1000, so the sum of its partial sums is 99,000. Then, for the new sequence, each partial sum ( T_k ) for ( k geq 2 ) is 1 plus the partial sum ( S_{k-1} ) of the original sequence. So, when I sum all ( T_k ) from ( k = 1 ) to ( 100 ), it's 1 (for ( T_1 )) plus the sum from ( k=2 ) to ( 100 ) of ( 1 + S_{k-1} ). Breaking that down, I correctly identified that the sum of 1's is 99 and the sum of ( S_{k-1} ) is 99,000. Adding those together gives 99,099, and then adding the initial 1 gives 99,100. Dividing that by 100 gives 991. That seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me think about another approach. Maybe I can express the Cesaro sum of the new sequence in terms of the original Cesaro sum.Let’s denote the original sequence as ( P = (p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{99}) ) with Cesaro sum 1000. So, ( frac{1}{99} sum_{k=1}^{99} S_k = 1000 ), meaning ( sum_{k=1}^{99} S_k = 99,000 ).The new sequence ( Q = (1, p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{99}) ). Let's denote the partial sums of ( Q ) as ( T_k ). So, ( T_1 = 1 ), and for ( k geq 2 ), ( T_k = 1 + S_{k-1} ).Therefore, the sum ( sum_{k=1}^{100} T_k = T_1 + sum_{k=2}^{100} T_k = 1 + sum_{k=2}^{100} (1 + S_{k-1}) ).Which is the same as before: 1 + (99 * 1) + ( sum_{k=1}^{99} S_k ) = 1 + 99 + 99,000 = 99,100.So, the Cesaro sum is 99,100 / 100 = 991. So, that's consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can think about how adding a term affects the Cesaro sum.The Cesaro sum is the average of the partial sums. So, when we add a new term at the beginning, it affects all the subsequent partial sums.In the original sequence, the partial sums are ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{99} ). In the new sequence, the partial sums are:- ( T_1 = 1 )- ( T_2 = 1 + p_1 = 1 + S_1 )- ( T_3 = 1 + p_1 + p_2 = 1 + S_2 )- ...- ( T_{100} = 1 + p_1 + p_2 + ldots + p_{99} = 1 + S_{99} )So, each ( T_k ) for ( k geq 2 ) is 1 plus the corresponding ( S_{k-1} ). So, the sum of all ( T_k ) is ( T_1 + sum_{k=2}^{100} T_k = 1 + sum_{k=2}^{100} (1 + S_{k-1}) ).Which is again 1 + 99*1 + sum_{k=1}^{99} S_k = 1 + 99 + 99,000 = 99,100.So, the Cesaro sum is 99,100 / 100 = 991.Therefore, I think 991 is the correct answer, which is option B.Just to make sure, let me consider a smaller example to test my reasoning.Suppose the original sequence is just (a), so n=1, and its Cesaro sum is (S1)/1 = a. So, if a=1000, then the Cesaro sum is 1000.Now, if we add a 1 at the beginning, the new sequence is (1, a). The partial sums are:- T1 = 1- T2 = 1 + aSo, the Cesaro sum is (1 + (1 + a))/2 = (2 + a)/2.If a=1000, then Cesaro sum is (2 + 1000)/2 = 1002/2 = 501.Wait, that's a big drop. But in the original problem, adding 1 didn't drop the Cesaro sum that much. Hmm, so maybe my reasoning is correct, but in the small case, the effect is more pronounced because we're adding a 1 to a single term.Wait, but in the original problem, the original Cesaro sum is 1000, which is the average of the partial sums of the original 99-term sequence. So, each partial sum is contributing to that average. When we add a 1 at the beginning, we're effectively shifting all the partial sums by 1, but also adding a new partial sum at the beginning.Wait, in the small example, adding 1 to a single term sequence, the Cesaro sum went from 1000 to 501, which is a significant change. In the original problem, adding 1 only decreased the Cesaro sum by 9, from 1000 to 991. So, that seems consistent because in the original problem, the added 1 is only affecting 99 partial sums, not just one.Wait, let me think again. In the small example, the original Cesaro sum was 1000, which was just the single term a=1000. After adding 1, the new Cesaro sum is (1 + (1 + 1000))/2 = 1002/2 = 501. So, it's halved approximately.In the original problem, adding 1 to the beginning of a 99-term sequence, which had a Cesaro sum of 1000, resulted in a new Cesaro sum of 991, which is just 9 less. So, that seems like a small change, but in the small example, it was a huge change.But why the difference? Because in the small example, the original sequence had only one term, so adding a term at the beginning significantly changes the average. In the original problem, adding one term to a 99-term sequence, making it 100 terms, the effect is less pronounced because the added 1 is only contributing to the first partial sum and shifting all the others by 1.Wait, let me think about the total sum of the original sequence. The Cesaro sum is the average of the partial sums. So, the total sum of the partial sums is 99,000. The total sum of the original sequence is ( S_{99} ). Let me compute ( S_{99} ).Wait, the Cesaro sum is 1000, which is ( frac{1}{99} sum_{k=1}^{99} S_k = 1000 ). So, ( sum_{k=1}^{99} S_k = 99,000 ).But what is ( S_{99} )? That's the total sum of the original sequence. Let me denote ( S = S_{99} ). Then, the average of the partial sums is 1000, so:[frac{1}{99}(S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_{99}) = 1000]But in the new sequence, the total sum is ( 1 + S ). So, the Cesaro sum of the new sequence is:[frac{1}{100}(T_1 + T_2 + cdots + T_{100}) = frac{1}{100}(99,100) = 991]So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can express the Cesaro sum of the new sequence in terms of the original Cesaro sum.Let me denote:- For the original sequence ( P ), Cesaro sum ( C_P = 1000 ).- For the new sequence ( Q ), Cesaro sum ( C_Q = ? )We can express ( C_Q ) as:[C_Q = frac{1}{100} left( T_1 + T_2 + cdots + T_{100} right)]But as we saw earlier, ( T_1 = 1 ) and ( T_k = 1 + S_{k-1} ) for ( k geq 2 ). So,[sum_{k=1}^{100} T_k = 1 + sum_{k=2}^{100} (1 + S_{k-1}) = 1 + 99 + sum_{k=1}^{99} S_k = 100 + 99,000 = 99,100]Therefore,[C_Q = frac{99,100}{100} = 991]So, that's consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the relationship between the Cesaro sums.The Cesaro sum of the new sequence is:[C_Q = frac{1}{100} left( 1 + sum_{k=2}^{100} T_k right) = frac{1}{100} left( 1 + sum_{k=2}^{100} (1 + S_{k-1}) right)]Which is:[frac{1}{100} left( 1 + 99 + sum_{k=1}^{99} S_k right) = frac{1}{100} left( 100 + 99,000 right) = frac{99,100}{100} = 991]So, that's another way to see it.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the total sum of the original sequence.Wait, the Cesaro sum is the average of the partial sums. The total sum of the partial sums is 99,000. So, the average is 1000.In the new sequence, the partial sums are:- 1- 1 + p1- 1 + p1 + p2- ...- 1 + p1 + p2 + ... + p99So, the total sum of the partial sums for the new sequence is 1 + (1 + p1) + (1 + p1 + p2) + ... + (1 + p1 + ... + p99).Which can be written as:1 + [1 + (p1)] + [1 + (p1 + p2)] + ... + [1 + (p1 + ... + p99)]This can be reorganized as:1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 (total of 100 terms) + [p1 + (p1 + p2) + ... + (p1 + ... + p99)]Wait, no, actually, each term after the first 1 adds an additional 1 and the partial sums of the original sequence.Wait, let me think again.Each partial sum ( T_k ) for ( k geq 2 ) is 1 plus the partial sum ( S_{k-1} ) of the original sequence. So, the total sum of all ( T_k ) is:( T_1 + T_2 + ... + T_{100} = 1 + (1 + S_1) + (1 + S_2) + ... + (1 + S_{99}) )Which is:1 + [1 + 1 + ... + 1 (99 times)] + [S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{99}]So, that's:1 + 99*1 + 99,000 = 1 + 99 + 99,000 = 99,100Therefore, the Cesaro sum is 99,100 / 100 = 991.So, that's consistent with all my previous calculations.I think I'm confident that the answer is 991, which is option B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Two conspirators had a secret code. Sometimes their correspondence included simple arithmetic operations that appeared entirely innocent. However, in the code, each of the ten digits represented a letter of the alphabet. For example, once they encountered a sum which, after substituting the digits with corresponding letters, appeared as follows:begin{gathered}F L Y F O R Y O U R hline L I F Eend{gathered}It would be interesting to reconstruct this sum, knowing that I and O represent the digits 1 and 0, respectively.","answer":"Alright, so I've come across this interesting cryptarithmetic puzzle. It involves a sum where each letter stands for a unique digit. The puzzle is presented as:\`\`\`  F L Y  F O R+ Y O U R---------L I F E\`\`\`And we're given that I = 1 and O = 0. My goal is to figure out which digits correspond to each letter so that the addition holds true. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me list out all the unique letters involved in the puzzle. They are F, L, Y, O, R, U, I. Wait, that's seven letters. But since there are ten digits (0-9), each letter must correspond to a unique digit, and some digits won't be used. Given that O is 0 and I is 1, that leaves us with digits 2-9 for the other letters.Looking at the structure of the addition:- The first addend is a three-digit number: F L Y- The second addend is another three-digit number: F O R- The third addend is a four-digit number: Y O U R- The sum is a four-digit number: L I F ESo, when we add three numbers (two three-digit and one four-digit), we get a four-digit number. That tells me that the sum must be just over 1000, so the thousands digit in the result is L. Therefore, L must be 1, right? Wait, but I is already 1. Hmm, that can't be. So maybe L is 1? But I is 1. Wait, no, each letter represents a unique digit, so L can't be 1 because I is 1. Therefore, L must be a different digit. Hmm, that's confusing.Wait, hold on. Let me think again. The sum of three numbers: two three-digit and one four-digit. The maximum possible sum would be if all were the largest possible numbers. For example, 999 + 999 + 9999 = 11997, which is a five-digit number. But in our case, the sum is a four-digit number, so the total must be less than 10000. Therefore, the four-digit addend Y O U R must be such that when added to the two three-digit numbers, the total doesn't exceed 9999. That might help in constraining the possible values.Given that, let's consider the structure of the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit (units place) and moving left, keeping track of any carry-over.Let me write the addition vertically to visualize it better:\`\`\`    F L Y    F O R  + Y O U R  ---------  L I F E\`\`\`Wait, actually, to properly align the digits, let's adjust it:\`\`\`      F L Y      F O R    + Y O U R    -----------    L I F E\`\`\`So, aligning the digits:- Units place: Y + R + R = E (with possible carry)- Tens place: L + O + U = F (with possible carry)- Hundreds place: F + F + O = I (with possible carry)- Thousands place: Y = L (with possible carry)Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me count the digits properly.Wait, actually, the first two numbers are three-digit, so when adding to the four-digit number, we need to align them properly. Let me write it as:\`\`\`      F L Y      F O R    + Y O U R    -----------    L I F E\`\`\`So, the rightmost digits are:- Units place: Y (from FLY) + R (from FOR) + R (from YOUR) = E- Tens place: L (from FLY) + O (from FOR) + U (from YOUR) = F- Hundreds place: F (from FLY) + F (from FOR) + O (from YOUR) = I- Thousands place: Y (from YOUR) = LWait, that seems more accurate. Let me verify:- The first addend FLY is three digits: F (hundreds), L (tens), Y (units)- The second addend FOR is three digits: F (hundreds), O (tens), R (units)- The third addend YOUR is four digits: Y (thousands), O (hundreds), U (tens), R (units)- The sum LIFE is four digits: L (thousands), I (hundreds), F (tens), E (units)So, when adding:- Units column: Y (from FLY) + R (from FOR) + R (from YOUR) = E (units place of sum) + 10 * carry1- Tens column: L (from FLY) + O (from FOR) + U (from YOUR) + carry1 = F (tens place of sum) + 10 * carry2- Hundreds column: F (from FLY) + F (from FOR) + O (from YOUR) + carry2 = I (hundreds place of sum) + 10 * carry3- Thousands column: Y (from YOUR) + carry3 = L (thousands place of sum)Given that, let's note down the equations:1. Units place: Y + R + R = E + 10 * c1   So, Y + 2R = E + 10c12. Tens place: L + O + U + c1 = F + 10c23. Hundreds place: F + F + O + c2 = I + 10c3   Which simplifies to 2F + O + c2 = I + 10c34. Thousands place: Y + c3 = LAdditionally, we know that I = 1 and O = 0.So, substituting I = 1 and O = 0 into the equations:Equation 3 becomes: 2F + 0 + c2 = 1 + 10c3 => 2F + c2 = 1 + 10c3Equation 2 becomes: L + 0 + U + c1 = F + 10c2 => L + U + c1 = F + 10c2Equation 4 becomes: Y + c3 = LEquation 1 remains: Y + 2R = E + 10c1Also, all letters F, L, Y, R, U, E must be unique digits, different from I=1 and O=0.So, let's note the possible values:Digits available: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 (since 0 and 1 are taken by O and I)Letters to assign: F, L, Y, R, U, EEach must be unique.Let me start with equation 3: 2F + c2 = 1 + 10c3Since F is a digit from 2-9, let's consider possible values of F and c3.c3 can be 0 or 1 because the maximum carry from hundreds place is 1 (since 2F + c2 can be at most 2*9 + 1 = 19, so c3 can be 1).Let me consider c3=0:Then equation 3: 2F + c2 = 1But 2F is at least 4 (since F >=2), so 2F + c2 >=4, which can't equal 1. So c3 cannot be 0.Therefore, c3 must be 1.So equation 3 becomes: 2F + c2 = 1 + 10*1 => 2F + c2 = 11So, 2F + c2 = 11Possible values for F and c2:c2 can be 0 or 1 (since carry from tens place can be at most 1).Case 1: c2=1Then 2F +1 =11 => 2F=10 => F=5Case 2: c2=0Then 2F=11 => F=5.5, which is not possible since F must be integer.Therefore, only Case 1 is possible: c2=1, F=5So, F=5, c2=1, c3=1So, F is 5.Now, let's move to equation 4: Y + c3 = L => Y +1 = LSo, L = Y +1Therefore, Y must be one less than L.Since Y and L are digits from 2-9, and unique, Y can be from 2-8, L from 3-9.Next, equation 2: L + U + c1 = F + 10c2We know F=5, c2=1So, L + U + c1 =5 +10*1=15Thus, L + U + c1 =15But L = Y +1, so substituting:(Y +1) + U + c1 =15 => Y + U + c1 =14So, Y + U + c1 =14c1 is the carry from the units place. Let's recall equation 1:Y + 2R = E +10c1So, Y + 2R can be E +10c1Since Y and R are digits (2-9), Y + 2R can range from 2+2*2=6 to 9 +2*9=27Therefore, c1 can be 0,1, or 2But since Y + U + c1=14, and Y and U are at least 2, let's see:If c1=0: Y + U=14If c1=1: Y + U=13If c1=2: Y + U=12But Y and U are digits from 2-9, so let's see possible combinations.But let's also remember that Y = L -1, and L is a digit from 3-9.So, Y can be 2-8, L=3-9.Let me consider possible c1 values.Case 1: c1=2Then Y + U=12Possible Y and U pairs (Y=2-8, U=2-9, Y != U, Y != L-1, U != others)But let's hold on and see if we can find more constraints.From equation 1: Y + 2R = E +10c1We have c1=2, so Y + 2R = E +20But Y and R are digits, so Y + 2R >=2 + 2*2=6, and <=9 +2*9=27But Y +2R = E +20, so E = Y +2R -20Since E must be a digit (0-9), Y +2R must be between 20 and 29.But Y is at least 2, R is at least 2:Minimum Y +2R=2 +4=6, but to get E, we need Y +2R >=20.So, Y +2R >=20.Therefore, R must be at least (20 - Y)/2. Since Y <=9, R >= (20 -9)/2=5.5, so R >=6.So R can be 6,7,8,9.Similarly, Y must be such that Y +2R <=27 (since Y +2R <=9 +18=27)So, E = Y +2R -20 must be <=7 (since 27 -20=7)So E can be 0-7, but E must be unique, not equal to I=1, O=0, F=5, L=Y+1, Y, R, U.So, E is another digit.So, let's consider c1=2.Then Y + U=12Possible Y and U pairs:Y can be 2-8, U=12 - Y.But U must be a digit from 2-9, not equal to Y, L, F, O, I, R, E.Let me list possible Y and U:Y=3, U=9Y=4, U=8Y=5, U=7Y=6, U=6 (invalid, same digit)Y=7, U=5Y=8, U=4Y=9, U=3But Y must be <=8 because L=Y+1 <=9So Y=3,4,5,7,8,9But Y=9 would make L=10, which is invalid, so Y<=8.So Y=3,4,5,7,8So possible pairs:Y=3, U=9Y=4, U=8Y=5, U=7Y=7, U=5Y=8, U=4Now, let's consider equation 1 with c1=2:Y +2R = E +20So E = Y +2R -20E must be a digit, so Y +2R must be between 20 and 27.Also, E must be unique, not equal to 0,1,5, L, Y, R, U.Let's take each possible Y and U pair and see if we can find R and E.Starting with Y=3, U=9Then L=Y+1=4So letters assigned so far:F=5, I=1, O=0, Y=3, L=4, U=9Available digits: 2,6,7,8Letters left: R, EFrom equation 1: 3 +2R = E +20 => 2R = E +17So E =2R -17Since E must be a digit (0-9), 2R -17 >=0 => R >=8.5, so R=9But U=9 is already taken, so R can't be 9. Therefore, no solution here.Next, Y=4, U=8Then L=5But F=5 is already taken, so L can't be 5. Therefore, invalid.Next, Y=5, U=7Then L=6Letters assigned: F=5, I=1, O=0, Y=5, L=6, U=7Wait, Y=5 and F=5 would conflict, since each letter must represent a unique digit. So Y can't be 5 if F=5. Therefore, invalid.Next, Y=7, U=5But F=5 is already taken, so U=5 is invalid.Next, Y=8, U=4Then L=9Letters assigned: F=5, I=1, O=0, Y=8, L=9, U=4Available digits: 2,3,6,7Letters left: R, EFrom equation 1: 8 +2R = E +20 => 2R = E +12 => E=2R -12E must be a digit, so 2R -12 >=0 => R >=6Possible R:6,7If R=6:E=2*6 -12=0, but O=0 is already taken. So invalid.If R=7:E=2*7 -12=14-12=2So E=2Check if E=2 is available: Yes, since digits used are 0,1,4,5,8,9,6,7. Wait, no, R=7, E=2. So digits used: 0,1,4,5,7,8,9,2. So E=2 is available.So let's check:R=7, E=2Now, let's check if all digits are unique:F=5, I=1, O=0, Y=8, L=9, U=4, R=7, E=2Digits used:0,1,2,4,5,7,8,9Available digits:3,6But we have no more letters to assign, so that's fine.Now, let's verify all equations.Equation 1: Y +2R =8 +14=22=E +10c1=2 +20=22.

Let me try to understand it step by step.First, there's a certain amount of saltwater that's 4% salt. Then, some water evaporates, and the concentration becomes 10%. After that, they add 300 grams of 4% saltwater, and the mixture becomes 6.4% saltwater. The question is asking how many grams of the original 4% saltwater there were initially.Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Maybe I can represent the initial amount of saltwater with a variable. Let's say the initial amount is x grams. Since it's 4% salt, the amount of salt in it would be 0.04x grams.Then, some water evaporates, and the concentration becomes 10%. Evaporation removes water but leaves the salt content the same. So, the amount of salt remains 0.04x grams, but the total amount of saltwater decreases. Let me denote the amount after evaporation as y grams. So, the concentration after evaporation is 10%, which means:0.10y = 0.04xSo, from this equation, I can solve for y in terms of x:y = (0.04x) / 0.10 = 0.4xSo, after evaporation, the amount of saltwater is 0.4x grams. That means that 0.6x grams of water have evaporated. Okay, that makes sense.Next, they add 300 grams of 4% saltwater to this evaporated saltwater. So, the total amount of saltwater now is y + 300 grams, which is 0.4x + 300 grams.The amount of salt in the added 300 grams is 0.04 * 300 = 12 grams. So, the total amount of salt in the mixture is the original salt (0.04x) plus 12 grams.The concentration of the mixture is now 6.4%, so we can write the equation:(0.04x + 12) / (0.4x + 300) = 0.064Okay, so now I have an equation with x that I can solve.Let me write that out:(0.04x + 12) / (0.4x + 300) = 0.064To solve for x, I'll multiply both sides by (0.4x + 300):0.04x + 12 = 0.064 * (0.4x + 300)Let me compute the right side:0.064 * 0.4x = 0.0256x0.064 * 300 = 19.2So, the equation becomes:0.04x + 12 = 0.0256x + 19.2Now, let's subtract 0.0256x from both sides:0.04x - 0.0256x + 12 = 19.2Which simplifies to:0.0144x + 12 = 19.2Subtract 12 from both sides:0.0144x = 7.2Now, divide both sides by 0.0144:x = 7.2 / 0.0144Let me compute that. 7.2 divided by 0.0144. Hmm, 0.0144 goes into 7.2 how many times?First, 0.0144 * 500 = 7.2, because 0.0144 * 100 = 1.44, so times 5 is 7.2. So, 0.0144 * 500 = 7.2.Therefore, x = 500 grams.Wait, so the initial amount of saltwater was 500 grams? Let me verify that.So, initial saltwater: 500 grams, 4% salt, so 20 grams of salt.After evaporation, the concentration becomes 10%. So, the amount of salt is still 20 grams. Let me find the new amount of saltwater:20 grams is 10%, so total saltwater is 20 / 0.10 = 200 grams.So, after evaporation, it's 200 grams.Then, adding 300 grams of 4% saltwater, which is 12 grams of salt, as I calculated earlier.So, total salt is 20 + 12 = 32 grams.Total saltwater is 200 + 300 = 500 grams.So, the concentration is 32 / 500 = 0.064, which is 6.4%. Perfect, that matches.So, yes, the initial amount was 500 grams.Wait, but let me just go through the equations again to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.Starting with x = 500 grams.After evaporation, y = 0.4x = 0.4 * 500 = 200 grams.Adding 300 grams of 4% saltwater: 300 * 0.04 = 12 grams of salt.Total salt: 0.04 * 500 + 12 = 20 + 12 = 32 grams.Total solution: 200 + 300 = 500 grams.32 / 500 = 0.064, which is 6.4%. Yep, that's correct.So, the initial amount was 500 grams.I think that makes sense. Let me just recap the steps:1. Let x be the initial amount of 4% saltwater.2. After evaporation, the amount is y = 0.4x, since 10% concentration.3. Adding 300 grams of 4% saltwater, total salt is 0.04x + 12, total solution is 0.4x + 300.4. Set up the equation for 6.4% concentration: (0.04x + 12)/(0.4x + 300) = 0.064.5. Solve for x, which comes out to 500 grams.6. Verified the calculations, and it all checks out.So, I think 500 grams is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The initial amount of 4% saltwater was boxed{500} grams."},{"question":"There are two models of LCD television on sale. One is a '20 inch' standard model while the other is a '20 inch' widescreen model. The ratio of the length to the height of the standard model is (4: 3), while that of the widescreen model is (16: 9). Television screens are measured by the length of their diagonals, so both models have the same diagonal length of 20 inches. If the ratio of the area of the standard model to that of the widescreen model is (A: 300), find the value of (A).","answer":"First, I recognize that both the standard and widescreen models have a diagonal length of 20 inches. The standard model has a 4:3 aspect ratio, and the widescreen model has a 16:9 aspect ratio.For the standard model, I'll let the length be 4x and the height be 3x. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal can be expressed as √((4x)² + (3x)²) = 20 inches. Simplifying this equation, I find that x = 4. Therefore, the dimensions are 16 inches in length and 12 inches in height, resulting in an area of 192 square inches.For the widescreen model, I'll let the length be 16y and the height be 9y. Applying the Pythagorean theorem again, the diagonal is √((16y)² + (9y)²) = 20 inches. Solving for y, I find that y = 1. Therefore, the dimensions are 16 inches in length and 9 inches in height, giving an area of 144 square inches.Finally, to find the ratio A:300, I set up the proportion 192/144 = A/300 and solve for A, which gives A = 400."},{"question":"Darry is a roofer and has to climb ladders multiple times a day. He climbs his full ladder, which has 11 steps, 10 times today. He also climbs his smaller ladder, which has 6 steps, 7 times today. He did not climb any steps otherwise. In total, how many times has Darry climbed a step today?","answer":"First, I need to calculate the total number of steps Darry climbed using his full ladder. The full ladder has 11 steps, and he climbed it 10 times. So, 11 steps multiplied by 10 climbs equals 110 steps.Next, I'll calculate the total steps for the smaller ladder. The smaller ladder has 6 steps, and he climbed it 7 times. Therefore, 6 steps multiplied by 7 climbs equals 42 steps.Finally, to find the total number of steps Darry climbed today, I'll add the steps from both ladders together. 110 steps from the full ladder plus 42 steps from the smaller ladder equals 152 steps in total."},{"question":"Find the area of the region in the (xy)-plane satisfying (x^{6} - x^{2} + y^{2} leq 0).","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the area of the region in the (xy)-plane defined by the inequality (x^{6} - x^{2} + y^{2} leq 0). Hmm, let me try to understand what this inequality represents. It looks like a combination of terms involving (x) and (y). Maybe I can rearrange it to get a better sense of the shape.Starting with the given inequality:[x^{6} - x^{2} + y^{2} leq 0]I can rearrange it to:[y^{2} leq x^{2} - x^{6}]That seems useful. So, (y^{2}) is less than or equal to (x^{2} - x^{6}). Since (y^{2}) is always non-negative, the right-hand side must also be non-negative for the inequality to hold. Therefore, we must have:[x^{2} - x^{6} geq 0]Let me solve this inequality to find the range of (x) values where the region exists.Factor out (x^{2}):[x^{2}(1 - x^{4}) geq 0]So, this product is non-negative when either both factors are non-negative or both are non-positive. But (x^{2}) is always non-negative, so the sign of the product depends on (1 - x^{4}).Thus, (1 - x^{4} geq 0) implies:[x^{4} leq 1 implies |x| leq 1]So, the region exists only when (x) is between (-1) and (1). That makes sense because beyond (x = pm1), the term (x^{6}) would dominate (x^{2}), making (x^{2} - x^{6}) negative, which can't be since (y^{2}) is non-negative.Now, going back to the inequality:[y^{2} leq x^{2} - x^{6}]This can be rewritten as:[y^{2} leq x^{2}(1 - x^{4})]Taking square roots on both sides (and remembering that (y) can be positive or negative), we get:[|y| leq |x|sqrt{1 - x^{4}}]Since (|x|) is just (x) when (x) is positive and (-x) when (x) is negative, but since we're squaring it, it doesn't matter. So, the region is symmetric with respect to both the (x)-axis and (y)-axis because replacing (x) with (-x) or (y) with (-y) doesn't change the inequality.Therefore, I can compute the area in the first quadrant and then multiply by 4 to get the total area. That should simplify calculations.So, let's focus on the first quadrant where (x geq 0) and (y geq 0). The inequality becomes:[y leq xsqrt{1 - x^{4}}]So, the region is bounded by (y = 0), (x = 0), and (y = xsqrt{1 - x^{4}}). The area in the first quadrant can be found by integrating (y) from 0 to (xsqrt{1 - x^{4}}) with respect to (x), from (x = 0) to (x = 1).Thus, the area (A) is:[A = 4 times int_{0}^{1} xsqrt{1 - x^{4}} , dx]Hmm, that integral looks a bit tricky. Let me see if I can find a substitution to simplify it.Let me set (u = x^{2}). Then, (du = 2x , dx), which means (x , dx = frac{1}{2} du). Also, when (x = 0), (u = 0), and when (x = 1), (u = 1).Substituting into the integral:[int_{0}^{1} xsqrt{1 - x^{4}} , dx = int_{0}^{1} sqrt{1 - u^{2}} times frac{1}{2} du = frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{1} sqrt{1 - u^{2}} , du]Ah, that's much better! The integral of (sqrt{1 - u^{2}}) is a standard integral, which represents the area of a quarter-circle of radius 1. Specifically:[int_{0}^{1} sqrt{1 - u^{2}} , du = frac{pi}{4}]So, substituting back:[frac{1}{2} times frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{8}]Therefore, the area in the first quadrant is (frac{pi}{8}), and the total area is:[A = 4 times frac{pi}{8} = frac{pi}{2}]Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that substitution step because sometimes when changing variables, limits can change or coefficients might be off.We set (u = x^{2}), so (du = 2x dx), which gives (x dx = frac{du}{2}). Then, the integral becomes:[int_{0}^{1} sqrt{1 - u^{2}} times frac{du}{2}]Which is indeed (frac{1}{2} times frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{8}). So, that seems correct.Therefore, multiplying by 4 gives (frac{pi}{2}). Hmm, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me think about the original inequality again.The inequality is (x^{6} - x^{2} + y^{2} leq 0), which can be rewritten as (y^{2} leq x^{2} - x^{6}). So, this is similar to an ellipse or a circle equation, but with higher powers.Wait, actually, when I set (u = x^{2}), the equation becomes (y^{2} leq u(1 - u^{2})). So, in terms of (u) and (y), it's a quadratic in (y), but (u) is a function of (x). So, the substitution seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize it differently. Let me try another substitution to confirm.Let me set (t = x^{2}), so (dt = 2x dx), which is similar to the previous substitution. Then, the integral becomes:[int_{0}^{1} xsqrt{1 - x^{4}} dx = frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{1} sqrt{1 - t^{2}} dt]Which again gives (frac{pi}{8}). So, that seems consistent.Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. The area is (frac{pi}{2}).But just to be thorough, let me visualize the region. For (x) between (-1) and (1), the curve (y = pm xsqrt{1 - x^{4}}) is symmetric across both axes. At (x = 0), (y = 0). As (x) approaches 1, (y) approaches 0 as well. The curve is kind of a \\"flower petal\\" shape, symmetric in all four quadrants.Wait, actually, when (x) is between (-1) and (1), (y) is bounded by (xsqrt{1 - x^{4}}), which is similar to a circle equation but with a higher power. So, the shape is actually a type of superellipse.But regardless of the shape, the integral seems to compute correctly to (frac{pi}{2}). Let me think about another way to compute this.Alternatively, maybe using polar coordinates. Let me try that.Expressing the inequality in polar coordinates, where (x = rcostheta) and (y = rsintheta). Then, the inequality becomes:[(rcostheta)^6 - (rcostheta)^2 + (rsintheta)^2 leq 0]Simplify:[r^{6}cos^{6}theta - r^{2}cos^{2}theta + r^{2}sin^{2}theta leq 0]Factor out (r^{2}):[r^{2}(r^{4}cos^{6}theta - cos^{2}theta + sin^{2}theta) leq 0]Since (r^{2}) is always non-negative, the inequality reduces to:[r^{4}cos^{6}theta - cos^{2}theta + sin^{2}theta leq 0]Hmm, that seems more complicated. Maybe not the best approach.Alternatively, perhaps using symmetry or recognizing the integral as a beta function or gamma function.Wait, the integral we had was:[int_{0}^{1} xsqrt{1 - x^{4}} dx]Let me make another substitution. Let (u = x^{4}), so (du = 4x^{3} dx). Hmm, but that might complicate things because we have an (x) term outside.Alternatively, let me set (t = x^{2}), so (dt = 2x dx), which gives (x dx = dt/2). Then, the integral becomes:[int_{0}^{1} sqrt{1 - t^{2}} times frac{dt}{2}]Which is the same as before, leading to (frac{pi}{8}). So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, recognizing that the integral (int_{0}^{1} sqrt{1 - t^{2}} dt) is the area of a quarter-circle, which is (frac{pi}{4}), so half of that is (frac{pi}{8}).Therefore, I think my initial calculation is correct. So, the total area is (frac{pi}{2}).But just to make sure, let me compute the integral numerically for a sanity check.Compute (int_{0}^{1} xsqrt{1 - x^{4}} dx). Let me approximate it numerically.Let me use substitution (u = x^{2}), so (du = 2x dx), so (x dx = du/2). Then, the integral becomes (frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{1} sqrt{1 - u^{2}} du). The integral of (sqrt{1 - u^{2}}) from 0 to 1 is (frac{pi}{4}), so half of that is (frac{pi}{8}), which is approximately 0.3927.Multiplying by 4 gives approximately 1.5708, which is approximately (pi/2) (since (pi approx 3.1416), so (pi/2 approx 1.5708)). So, that seems consistent.Therefore, I think my answer is correct.**Final Answer**The area of the region is boxed{dfrac{pi}{2}}."},{"question":"Given overrightarrow{a}=(2,1), overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b}=(1,1), then overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b}= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm given two vectors, vector a and vector b. Vector a is (2,1). Then there's another equation: vector a minus 2 times vector b equals (1,1). I need to find the dot product of vector a and vector b, which is written as a·b. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, let me write down what I know. Vector a is (2,1). So, that's straightforward. Then, the equation given is a - 2b = (1,1). I need to find a·b. Hmm, so maybe I can solve for vector b first, and then compute the dot product.Let me write the equation again: a - 2b = (1,1). If I can solve for vector b, then I can find its components and then take the dot product with vector a. So, let's try to solve for vector b.Starting with the equation:a - 2b = (1,1)I can rearrange this equation to solve for vector b. Let me subtract vector a from both sides. Wait, actually, maybe it's better to isolate 2b first. Let's see:a - 2b = (1,1)Subtract a from both sides:-2b = (1,1) - aBut vector a is (2,1), so substituting that in:-2b = (1,1) - (2,1)Now, subtracting these vectors component-wise:(1 - 2, 1 - 1) = (-1, 0)So, -2b = (-1, 0). To solve for b, I can divide both sides by -2, which is the same as multiplying by (-1/2). Let's do that:b = (-1, 0) * (-1/2) = ( (-1)*(-1/2), 0*(-1/2) ) = (1/2, 0)So, vector b is (1/2, 0). Okay, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with a - 2b = (1,1). Subtract a: -2b = (1,1) - (2,1) = (-1,0). Then divide by -2: b = ( (-1)/(-2), 0/(-2) ) = (1/2, 0). Yep, that looks correct.Now that I have vector b, which is (1/2, 0), I can compute the dot product of vectors a and b. The dot product is calculated by multiplying the corresponding components and then adding them together. So, for vectors a = (a1, a2) and b = (b1, b2), the dot product is a1*b1 + a2*b2.Given that vector a is (2,1) and vector b is (1/2, 0), let's compute the dot product:a·b = (2)*(1/2) + (1)*(0)Calculating each term:2*(1/2) = 11*0 = 0Adding them together: 1 + 0 = 1So, the dot product of a and b is 1. Let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a calculation error.Vector a is (2,1), vector b is (1/2, 0). So, 2 times 1/2 is indeed 1, and 1 times 0 is 0. Adding those gives 1. Yep, that seems right.Wait, just to make sure, let me verify if vector b is correct. If I plug b back into the original equation, does it satisfy a - 2b = (1,1)?So, vector a is (2,1), vector b is (1/2, 0). Then 2b is 2*(1/2, 0) = (1, 0). Then a - 2b is (2,1) - (1,0) = (2-1, 1-0) = (1,1). Which matches the given equation. Perfect, so vector b is correct.Therefore, the dot product is indeed 1.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different reason. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.First, I remember that density is mass per unit volume. So, if moist air is less dense, that means for the same volume, it has less mass than dry air. But why would that be the case?Well, air is mostly nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂), right? And when it's moist, it means there's water vapor (H₂O) mixed in. So, instead of some N₂ and O₂ molecules, there are H₂O molecules. So, maybe the difference in molar mass between these gases is the key here.Let me recall the molar masses. Nitrogen gas (N₂) has a molar mass of about 28 g/mol (since each N is 14). Oxygen gas (O₂) is about 32 g/mol (each O is 16). Water vapor (H₂O) has a molar mass of 18 g/mol (2 from H and 16 from O). So, water is lighter than both nitrogen and oxygen.So, if moist air has water replacing some of the nitrogen and oxygen, which are heavier, the overall mass of the air would decrease. Since density is mass over volume, if the mass decreases and the volume stays the same, the density decreases. That makes sense. So, this would mean that moist air is less dense because water has a lower molar mass than N₂ and O₂.Looking at the options, option C says exactly that: \\"H₂O has a lower molar mass than N₂ or O₂.\\" So, that seems like the correct answer.But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Option A says that H₂O is a polar molecule, while N₂ and O₂ are not. Hmm, polarity might affect other properties, like solubility or the ability to form hydrogen bonds, but does it affect density? I don't think so directly. Density is more about mass per unit volume, which relates to molar mass and the size of the molecules.Option B mentions the boiling point of H₂O being higher. Well, boiling point relates to the temperature at which a substance changes from liquid to gas, but since we're talking about gases here (water vapor), I don't think boiling point affects the density in this context.Option D talks about heat capacity. Heat capacity is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of a substance. While that's an interesting property, I don't see how it directly affects the density of the air. Density is more about mass and volume, not about how much heat is absorbed or released.So, going back, the key factor is the molar mass. Water has a lower molar mass than nitrogen and oxygen, so when it replaces some of those molecules in the air, the overall density decreases. Therefore, the best explanation is option C.Just to double-check, let me think about the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. At the same temperature and pressure, the volume depends on the number of moles. But wait, if we're talking about density, which is mass over volume, and if we have the same volume, then the mass would be n times molar mass. Since water has a lower molar mass, replacing N₂ and O₂ with H₂O would decrease the total mass, hence lower density.Yep, that solidifies my reasoning. So, definitely option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"A school recruits students with special talents in art based on their entrance exam scores and determines a cut-off score for admission.

If the average score of all candidates is 90 points, what is the cut-off score for admission?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a school that admits students based on their entrance exam scores. They set a cut-off score, and they admit 2/5 of the candidates. The average score of the admitted candidates is 15 points higher than the cut-off, and the average score of those not admitted is 20 points lower than the cut-off. The overall average score of all candidates is 90 points. I need to find the cut-off score.Hmm, let me try to break this down. Let's denote the cut-off score as ( C ). The school admits ( frac{2}{5} ) of the candidates, so if there are ( N ) total candidates, then ( frac{2}{5}N ) are admitted, and ( frac{3}{5}N ) are not admitted.The average score of the admitted candidates is ( C + 15 ), and the average score of the non-admitted candidates is ( C - 20 ). The overall average score is 90. So, I can set up an equation using the total scores.Total score of admitted candidates: ( frac{2}{5}N times (C + 15) )Total score of non-admitted candidates: ( frac{3}{5}N times (C - 20) )Total score of all candidates: ( N times 90 )So, adding the total scores of admitted and non-admitted should equal the total score of all candidates:( frac{2}{5}N (C + 15) + frac{3}{5}N (C - 20) = 90N )Okay, now I can factor out ( N ) since it's common to all terms:( N left[ frac{2}{5}(C + 15) + frac{3}{5}(C - 20) right] = 90N )Divide both sides by ( N ) (assuming ( N neq 0 ), which makes sense because there are candidates):( frac{2}{5}(C + 15) + frac{3}{5}(C - 20) = 90 )Now, let's simplify this equation. First, distribute the fractions:( frac{2}{5}C + frac{2}{5} times 15 + frac{3}{5}C - frac{3}{5} times 20 = 90 )Calculate the constants:( frac{2}{5}C + 6 + frac{3}{5}C - 12 = 90 )Combine like terms:( (frac{2}{5}C + frac{3}{5}C) + (6 - 12) = 90 )( frac{5}{5}C - 6 = 90 )Simplify:( C - 6 = 90 )Add 6 to both sides:( C = 96 )Wait, so the cut-off score is 96? Let me verify this.If the cut-off is 96, then the admitted average is 96 + 15 = 111, and the non-admitted average is 96 - 20 = 76.Let me assume there are 5 candidates for simplicity (since fractions are easier with 5). So, 2 admitted and 3 not admitted.Total score: 2*111 + 3*76 = 222 + 228 = 450Average score: 450 / 5 = 90, which matches the given overall average. So, that seems correct.Wait, but 96 seems quite high if the overall average is 90. Let me think again.If the cut-off is 96, which is higher than the overall average, that might make sense because the admitted students have higher scores, pulling the average up, but the non-admitted have lower scores, pulling it down. But let me see if the math still holds.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me go back.Total score of admitted: ( frac{2}{5}N (C + 15) )Total score of non-admitted: ( frac{3}{5}N (C - 20) )Total score: ( frac{2}{5}N (C + 15) + frac{3}{5}N (C - 20) = 90N )Yes, that seems right.Simplify:( frac{2}{5}(C + 15) + frac{3}{5}(C - 20) = 90 )Multiply through by 5 to eliminate denominators:( 2(C + 15) + 3(C - 20) = 450 )Expand:( 2C + 30 + 3C - 60 = 450 )Combine like terms:( 5C - 30 = 450 )Add 30 to both sides:( 5C = 480 )Divide by 5:( C = 96 )Yes, that's consistent. So, the cut-off score is 96. It's higher than the overall average because the admitted students, though fewer in number, have significantly higher scores, which affects the overall average. The non-admitted students, being more in number, have lower scores but not low enough to bring the overall average below 90.Wait, but 96 is 6 points above 90, and the non-admitted average is 76, which is 14 points below 90. So, the admitted students are 111, which is 21 points above 90, and non-admitted are 76, which is 14 below. The ratio of admitted to non-admitted is 2:3. So, the weighted average is (2/5)*21 + (3/5)*(-14) = (42/5) - (42/5) = 0. Wait, that can't be.Wait, no, that's not the right way to compute it. The overall average is 90, so the deviations from 90 should balance out.Let me think in terms of deviations.Let’s denote the overall average as 90.Admitted students: average is 15 above cut-off, which is 96, so 111, which is 21 above 90.Non-admitted students: average is 20 below cut-off, which is 76, which is 14 below 90.So, the admitted students are 21 points above, non-admitted are 14 points below.The ratio of admitted to non-admitted is 2:3.So, the total deviation is (2/5)*21 + (3/5)*(-14) = (42/5) - (42/5) = 0. So, it balances out, which is why the overall average is 90.So, that makes sense. So, the cut-off is 96.Wait, but 96 is quite high. Let me think if that's reasonable.If the overall average is 90, and the cut-off is 96, which is 6 points above the average, but the admitted students are 2/5 of the total, so a smaller group with higher scores, and the rest are below.But let's compute the exact average.Total score: 2/5*(96 + 15) + 3/5*(96 - 20) = 2/5*111 + 3/5*76Compute 2/5*111: (222)/5 = 44.43/5*76: (228)/5 = 45.6Total: 44.4 + 45.6 = 90, which is correct.So, yes, 96 is correct.Wait, but just to make sure, let me try plugging in another number, say, if C was 90.Then admitted average would be 105, non-admitted average would be 70.Total score: 2/5*105 + 3/5*70 = 42 + 42 = 84, which is less than 90, so that's not correct.If C was 100, admitted average 115, non-admitted 80.Total score: 2/5*115 + 3/5*80 = 46 + 48 = 94, which is higher than 90.So, when C is 96, total is 90, which is correct.So, yeah, 96 is the correct cut-off score.**Final Answer**The cut-off score for admission is boxed{96}."},{"question":"An adult elephant needs to eat 90 bananas every day, while a baby elephant needs to eat 60 bananas every day.

It is known that a disc with a diameter of exactly 1 m weighs exactly 100 kg. During manufacturing, a measurement error occurs, and hence the standard deviation of the radius is 10 mm. Engineer Sidorov believes that a stack of 100 discs will weigh on average 10000 kg. By how much is Engineer Sidorov mistaken?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about metal discs being cut at a factory. Each disc is supposed to have a diameter of 1 meter, which means the radius is 0.5 meters. It's given that a disc with exactly 1 meter diameter weighs exactly 100 kg. Now, there's a measurement error during manufacturing, and the standard deviation of the radius is 10 mm, which is 0.01 meters. Engineer Sidorov thinks that a stack of 100 discs will weigh on average 10000 kg. I need to figure out by how much he's mistaken.Hmm, let's break this down. First, the weight of a disc depends on its area because the thickness is probably constant, right? So, if the area changes, the weight changes proportionally. The area of a circle is πr², so if the radius varies, the area will vary as well.Given that the standard deviation of the radius is 10 mm, which is 0.01 meters, I think this means that the radius isn't exactly 0.5 meters every time, but varies with a standard deviation of 0.01 meters. So, some discs will be slightly larger, some slightly smaller.Now, Engineer Sidorov is assuming that each disc weighs exactly 100 kg on average, so 100 discs would weigh 10000 kg. But because of the variation in radius, the actual average weight might be different. I need to find the expected weight of a disc and then multiply that by 100 to see the total weight.Let me recall that for a random variable, the expected value of its square is related to its variance. Specifically, Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])². So, if I can find the variance of the radius, I can find E[r²], which is needed for the area.Given that the standard deviation of the radius is 0.01 meters, the variance σ² is (0.01)² = 0.0001 m². The expected value of the radius E[r] is 0.5 meters because that's the target diameter.So, Var(r) = E[r²] - (E[r])². Plugging in the numbers:0.0001 = E[r²] - (0.5)²0.0001 = E[r²] - 0.25E[r²] = 0.25 + 0.0001 = 0.2501 m²Okay, so the expected value of r squared is 0.2501. Now, the area of a disc is πr², so the expected area E[A] is π * E[r²] = π * 0.2501.Calculating that, π is approximately 3.1416, so:E[A] ≈ 3.1416 * 0.2501 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.25 + 3.1416 * 0.0001 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.00031416 ≈ 0.7857 m²Wait, let me double-check that multiplication. 0.2501 is 0.25 + 0.0001, so multiplying by π gives π*0.25 + π*0.0001. π*0.25 is approximately 0.7854, and π*0.0001 is approximately 0.00031416. Adding them together gives approximately 0.78571416 m².So, the expected area is approximately 0.78571416 m².Now, since the weight is proportional to the area, and a disc with area π*(0.5)² = π*0.25 ≈ 0.7854 m² weighs exactly 100 kg, the expected weight of a disc can be found by comparing the expected area to the nominal area.Let me denote the nominal area as A0 = π*(0.5)² = 0.7854 m², and the expected area as E[A] = 0.78571416 m².So, the ratio of expected area to nominal area is E[A]/A0 ≈ 0.78571416 / 0.7854 ≈ 1.000399.Therefore, the expected weight E[W] is 100 kg * (E[A]/A0) ≈ 100 * 1.000399 ≈ 100.0399 kg.So, each disc is expected to weigh approximately 100.04 kg instead of exactly 100 kg.Therefore, for 100 discs, the expected total weight would be 100 * 100.04 ≈ 10004 kg.Wait, Engineer Sidorov thought it would be 10000 kg, so the mistake is 10004 - 10000 = 4 kg.But let me think again. Is this correct?Alternatively, maybe I should model the weight as a function of radius and use the variance to find the expected weight.So, weight W = k * π r², where k is the constant of proportionality. Given that when r = 0.5 m, W = 100 kg, so k = 100 / (π*(0.5)^2) = 100 / (π*0.25) = 100 / 0.7854 ≈ 127.32395 kg/m².So, k ≈ 127.32395 kg/m².Therefore, the expected weight E[W] = k * E[π r²] = k * π E[r²].We already calculated E[r²] = 0.2501, so:E[W] = 127.32395 * π * 0.2501Wait, hold on, that seems a bit conflicting with the previous approach.Wait, no, actually, since W = k * π r², then E[W] = k * π E[r²]. But k is 100 / (π * 0.25), so substituting back:E[W] = (100 / (π * 0.25)) * π * E[r²] = (100 / 0.25) * E[r²] = 400 * E[r²]Since E[r²] = 0.2501, then E[W] = 400 * 0.2501 = 100.04 kg.So, same result as before. So, each disc is expected to weigh 100.04 kg, so 100 discs would be 10004 kg.Therefore, Engineer Sidorov is mistaken by 4 kg.Wait, but let me think about whether the variance affects the expectation. Since the radius has a variance, does that mean the expectation of the area is higher than the area of the expectation? Yes, because area is a convex function of radius, so by Jensen's inequality, E[π r²] > π E[r]².Which is exactly what we saw: E[r²] = Var(r) + (E[r])² = 0.0001 + 0.25 = 0.2501, so E[π r²] = π * 0.2501 ≈ 0.7857 m², which is slightly larger than π*(0.5)^2 ≈ 0.7854 m².Therefore, the expected weight is slightly higher, leading to a total weight of 10004 kg instead of 10000 kg.So, Engineer Sidorov is mistaken by 4 kg.But hold on, let me check the calculation again because 0.2501 is just a tiny bit larger than 0.25, so the difference is 0.0001. So, 0.0001 in r², times π, is 0.0001 * π ≈ 0.000314 m². Then, the weight is proportional to the area, so the extra area is 0.000314 m², which when multiplied by k (127.32395 kg/m²) gives extra weight per disc: 0.000314 * 127.32395 ≈ 0.04 kg.Therefore, each disc is on average 0.04 kg heavier, so 100 discs would be 4 kg heavier. So, yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, if I think in terms of relative change. The radius has a standard deviation of 0.01 m, which is 2% of the mean radius (0.01 / 0.5 = 0.02). Since area depends on radius squared, the relative change in area is approximately twice the relative change in radius, so about 4%. But wait, that's for a small change, right? So, the variance in area would be approximately (2 * 0.02)^2 = 0.0016, but that might not be the exact way.Wait, maybe I should use the formula for variance of a function. If Y = f(X), then Var(Y) ≈ [f’(μ)]² Var(X). Here, Y = π r², so f(r) = π r², f’(r) = 2π r. So, Var(Y) ≈ (2π μ_r)² Var(r). Let's compute that.μ_r = 0.5 m, Var(r) = 0.0001 m².So, Var(Y) ≈ (2π * 0.5)^2 * 0.0001 = (π)^2 * 0.0001 ≈ (9.8696) * 0.0001 ≈ 0.00098696 m⁴.But wait, that's the variance of the area. But we were interested in the expected area, not the variance. So, maybe that's not directly helpful here.Alternatively, maybe I can use a Taylor expansion for E[f(r)] around μ_r. So, E[f(r)] ≈ f(μ_r) + 0.5 f''(μ_r) Var(r).Here, f(r) = π r², so f'(r) = 2π r, f''(r) = 2π.So, E[f(r)] ≈ π (0.5)^2 + 0.5 * 2π * Var(r) = π * 0.25 + π * 0.0001 = 0.25π + 0.0001π ≈ 0.7854 + 0.000314 ≈ 0.785714 m², which is the same as before.So, that confirms the expected area is 0.785714 m², leading to an expected weight of 100.04 kg per disc.Therefore, 100 discs would weigh approximately 10004 kg, so the mistake is 4 kg.Wait, but let me think again. Since the standard deviation is 10 mm, which is 0.01 m, and the radius is 0.5 m, so the coefficient of variation is 0.01 / 0.5 = 0.02, which is 2%. So, the relative error is 2%. Since area is proportional to radius squared, the relative error in area would be approximately 2 * 2% = 4%, but that's for the standard deviation, not the mean.Wait, actually, the relative change in area is approximately twice the relative change in radius, but that's for the standard deviation. For the expectation, it's a bit different because of the convexity.But in our case, we computed E[A] = π E[r²] = π (Var(r) + (E[r])²) = π (0.0001 + 0.25) = π * 0.2501 ≈ 0.7857 m², which is a 0.000314 m² increase over the nominal area of 0.7854 m². So, the relative increase is 0.000314 / 0.7854 ≈ 0.0004, which is 0.04%.Wait, that seems conflicting with the earlier thought about 4% relative change. Wait, no, because the 4% was for the standard deviation, not the mean. So, the expected area is only slightly larger, leading to a small increase in weight.Wait, but when I computed the expected weight, it was 100.04 kg, which is a 0.04 kg increase per disc, which is 0.04% of 100 kg. So, that's consistent with the 0.04% relative increase in area.But when I thought about the relative change in area due to radius, I thought it was about 4%, but that's actually the standard deviation of the area, not the expected area.So, in summary, the expected area is slightly larger due to the variance in radius, leading to a slightly higher expected weight per disc, and thus a total overestimation by 4 kg for 100 discs.Therefore, Engineer Sidorov is mistaken by 4 kg.But just to make sure, let me re-express the problem in terms of expected value.Let me denote r as the random variable for the radius, with E[r] = 0.5 m, Var(r) = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 m².The weight W is proportional to the area, so W = c * π r², where c is a constant.Given that when r = 0.5 m, W = 100 kg, so 100 = c * π (0.5)^2 => c = 100 / (π * 0.25) ≈ 127.32395 kg/m².Therefore, E[W] = E[c * π r²] = c * π E[r²] = c * π (Var(r) + (E[r])²) = c * π (0.0001 + 0.25).Plugging in the numbers:E[W] = 127.32395 * π * 0.2501 ≈ 127.32395 * 0.785714 ≈ ?Wait, 127.32395 * 0.7854 ≈ 100 kg, as given. So, 127.32395 * 0.785714 ≈ 100 + 127.32395 * (0.785714 - 0.7854) ≈ 100 + 127.32395 * 0.000314 ≈ 100 + 0.04 kg ≈ 100.04 kg.Yes, that's consistent. So, each disc is expected to weigh 100.04 kg, so 100 discs would weigh 10004 kg, which is 4 kg more than Engineer Sidorov's estimate.Therefore, the mistake is 4 kg.I think that's solid. I've approached it from different angles: directly computing E[r²], using the variance formula, and even considering the Taylor expansion for expected value. All methods lead to the same conclusion that the expected weight per disc is 100.04 kg, so 100 discs would be 4 kg heavier than expected.So, Engineer Sidorov is mistaken by 4 kg.**Final Answer**Engineer Sidorov is mistaken by boxed{4} kilograms."},{"question":"For any given natural number ( n ), if ( n^6 + 3a ) is the cube of a positive integer, where ( a ) is a positive integer, then:A. There are infinitely many such ( a ).B. There are finitely many such ( a ).C. There are no such ( a ).D. None of the above conclusions (A, B, C) are correct.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: For any given natural number ( n ), if ( n^6 + 3a ) is the cube of a positive integer, where ( a ) is a positive integer, then I need to determine whether there are infinitely many such ( a ), finitely many, none, or none of the above. The options are A, B, C, D.First, let me parse the problem. We have ( n ) as a natural number, so ( n ) is a positive integer. Then, ( n^6 + 3a ) is equal to some cube of a positive integer. Let me denote that cube as ( k^3 ), where ( k ) is a positive integer. So, the equation becomes:( n^6 + 3a = k^3 )From this, I can solve for ( a ):( 3a = k^3 - n^6 )( a = frac{k^3 - n^6}{3} )Since ( a ) must be a positive integer, ( k^3 - n^6 ) must be divisible by 3 and also positive. So, ( k^3 > n^6 ), which implies ( k > n^2 ) because ( (n^2)^3 = n^6 ). So, ( k ) has to be greater than ( n^2 ).Now, the question is about the number of such ( a ). So, for a given ( n ), how many ( a ) satisfy this equation? Or, perhaps, more generally, how does this work for any ( n )?Let me think about specific cases to get an intuition.Let's take ( n = 1 ). Then, ( n^6 = 1 ). So, the equation becomes:( 1 + 3a = k^3 )So, ( 3a = k^3 - 1 ), which means ( a = frac{k^3 - 1}{3} ). For ( a ) to be an integer, ( k^3 equiv 1 mod 3 ). Let's check the cubes modulo 3.Cubes modulo 3:- ( 0^3 equiv 0 mod 3 )- ( 1^3 equiv 1 mod 3 )- ( 2^3 = 8 equiv 2 mod 3 )So, ( k^3 equiv 0, 1, ) or ( 2 mod 3 ). We need ( k^3 equiv 1 mod 3 ), so ( k equiv 1 mod 3 ). Therefore, ( k = 3m + 1 ) for some integer ( m geq 0 ).Substituting back:( a = frac{(3m + 1)^3 - 1}{3} )Let me compute ( (3m + 1)^3 ):( (3m + 1)^3 = 27m^3 + 27m^2 + 9m + 1 )So, subtracting 1:( 27m^3 + 27m^2 + 9m )Divide by 3:( 9m^3 + 9m^2 + 3m )So, ( a = 9m^3 + 9m^2 + 3m ). Since ( m ) is a non-negative integer, ( a ) can take infinitely many values as ( m ) increases. Therefore, for ( n = 1 ), there are infinitely many ( a ).Hmm, so for ( n = 1 ), the answer would be A: infinitely many.But wait, the question says \\"for any given natural number ( n )\\", so does this hold for all ( n )?Let me try ( n = 2 ). Then, ( n^6 = 64 ). So, the equation becomes:( 64 + 3a = k^3 )So, ( 3a = k^3 - 64 ), hence ( a = frac{k^3 - 64}{3} ). Again, ( k^3 ) must be congruent to 64 modulo 3. Let's compute 64 mod 3: 64 divided by 3 is 21 with a remainder of 1, so 64 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, ( k^3 ≡ 1 mod 3 ), which as before, implies ( k ≡ 1 mod 3 ). So, ( k = 3m + 1 ).Substituting:( a = frac{(3m + 1)^3 - 64}{3} )Compute ( (3m + 1)^3 ):Same as before, ( 27m^3 + 27m^2 + 9m + 1 ). Subtract 64:( 27m^3 + 27m^2 + 9m + 1 - 64 = 27m^3 + 27m^2 + 9m - 63 )Divide by 3:( 9m^3 + 9m^2 + 3m - 21 )So, ( a = 9m^3 + 9m^2 + 3m - 21 ). Now, since ( a ) must be positive, we need:( 9m^3 + 9m^2 + 3m - 21 > 0 )Let's solve for ( m ):( 9m^3 + 9m^2 + 3m > 21 )Try ( m = 1 ):( 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 ), which is equal, so ( a = 0 ), which is not positive.( m = 2 ):( 72 + 36 + 6 = 114 ), so ( a = 114 - 21 = 93 ). Positive.( m = 3 ):( 243 + 81 + 9 = 333 ), ( a = 333 - 21 = 312 ). Positive.So, for ( m geq 2 ), ( a ) is positive. So, again, there are infinitely many ( a ) for ( n = 2 ).Wait, so for ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ), there are infinitely many ( a ). Maybe this is always the case?Wait, let me check ( n = 3 ). ( n^6 = 729 ). So, equation:( 729 + 3a = k^3 )Thus, ( 3a = k^3 - 729 ), so ( a = frac{k^3 - 729}{3} ). Now, 729 is 9^3, so ( 729 ≡ 0 mod 3 ). Therefore, ( k^3 ≡ 0 mod 3 ), which implies ( k ≡ 0 mod 3 ). So, ( k = 3m ).Substituting:( a = frac{(3m)^3 - 729}{3} = frac{27m^3 - 729}{3} = 9m^3 - 243 )So, ( a = 9m^3 - 243 ). For ( a ) to be positive:( 9m^3 - 243 > 0 )( 9m^3 > 243 )( m^3 > 27 )( m > 3 )So, ( m geq 4 ). Therefore, for ( m = 4,5,6,... ), ( a ) is positive. So, again, infinitely many ( a ).Wait, so for ( n = 3 ), also infinitely many ( a ). Hmm.Wait, let me think about this. For each ( n ), ( n^6 ) is a perfect sixth power, which is also a perfect cube since ( 6 = 2 times 3 ). So, ( n^6 = (n^2)^3 ). Therefore, ( n^6 ) is a cube. So, the equation is ( (n^2)^3 + 3a = k^3 ).So, we have ( k^3 - (n^2)^3 = 3a ). Which factors as ( (k - n^2)(k^2 + kn^2 + n^4) = 3a ).So, ( (k - n^2)(k^2 + kn^2 + n^4) = 3a ).Since ( a ) is a positive integer, both ( k - n^2 ) and ( k^2 + kn^2 + n^4 ) must be positive integers, and their product is divisible by 3.So, let me denote ( d = k - n^2 ). Then, ( d ) is a positive integer because ( k > n^2 ). Then, ( k = n^2 + d ).Substituting back into the equation:( d times [(n^2 + d)^2 + (n^2 + d)n^2 + n^4] = 3a )Let me compute the second factor:First, expand ( (n^2 + d)^2 ):( n^4 + 2n^2 d + d^2 )Then, ( (n^2 + d)n^2 = n^4 + n^2 d )Adding these together with ( n^4 ):( (n^4 + 2n^2 d + d^2) + (n^4 + n^2 d) + n^4 )Combine like terms:- ( n^4 + n^4 + n^4 = 3n^4 )- ( 2n^2 d + n^2 d = 3n^2 d )- ( d^2 )So, the second factor is ( 3n^4 + 3n^2 d + d^2 ).Therefore, the equation becomes:( d(3n^4 + 3n^2 d + d^2) = 3a )So, ( 3a = d(3n^4 + 3n^2 d + d^2) )Therefore, ( a = frac{d(3n^4 + 3n^2 d + d^2)}{3} = frac{d(3n^4 + 3n^2 d + d^2)}{3} )Simplify:( a = d(n^4 + n^2 d) + frac{d^3}{3} )Wait, that might not be the most helpful way. Alternatively, factor out a 3:( a = frac{d(3n^4 + 3n^2 d + d^2)}{3} = d(n^4 + n^2 d) + frac{d^3}{3} )Hmm, but ( a ) must be an integer, so ( frac{d^3}{3} ) must be an integer. Therefore, ( d^3 ) must be divisible by 3, which implies that ( d ) must be divisible by 3, since 3 is prime. So, ( d = 3m ) where ( m ) is a positive integer.Therefore, substituting ( d = 3m ):( a = 3m(n^4 + n^2 times 3m) + frac{(3m)^3}{3} )Simplify:( a = 3m(n^4 + 3n^2 m) + frac{27m^3}{3} )( a = 3m n^4 + 9m^2 n^2 + 9m^3 )So, ( a = 3m n^4 + 9m^2 n^2 + 9m^3 )This can be factored as:( a = 3m(n^4 + 3m n^2 + 3m^2) )Alternatively, factor 3m:( a = 3m(n^4 + 3m n^2 + 3m^2) )So, for each positive integer ( m ), we get a corresponding ( a ). Therefore, for each ( n ), there are infinitely many ( m ), hence infinitely many ( a ).Wait, so this suggests that for any ( n ), there are infinitely many ( a ) such that ( n^6 + 3a ) is a perfect cube. So, the answer would be A: There are infinitely many such ( a ).But wait, let me double-check with another example. Let's take ( n = 4 ). Then, ( n^6 = 4096 ). So, equation:( 4096 + 3a = k^3 )Thus, ( 3a = k^3 - 4096 ), so ( a = frac{k^3 - 4096}{3} ). Now, 4096 is 16^3, so ( 4096 ≡ 0 mod 3 ). Therefore, ( k^3 ≡ 0 mod 3 ), so ( k ≡ 0 mod 3 ). Let ( k = 3m ).Thus, ( a = frac{(3m)^3 - 4096}{3} = frac{27m^3 - 4096}{3} = 9m^3 - frac{4096}{3} ). Wait, but 4096 divided by 3 is not an integer. 4096 ÷ 3 is approximately 1365.333... So, this would imply that ( a ) is not an integer unless ( 27m^3 - 4096 ) is divisible by 3. But since 4096 ≡ 1 mod 3 (because 4096 = 3*1365 + 1), then ( 27m^3 ≡ 0 mod 3 ), so ( 27m^3 - 4096 ≡ -1 mod 3 ), which is 2 mod 3. Therefore, ( a ) would not be an integer. Wait, that contradicts our earlier conclusion.Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.Wait, ( n = 4 ), ( n^6 = 4096 ). So, ( 4096 + 3a = k^3 ). So, ( k^3 = 4096 + 3a ). Since 4096 is 16^3, which is 4096. So, ( k ) must be greater than 16.But 4096 mod 3: 4 + 0 + 9 + 6 = 19, 1 + 9 = 10, 1 + 0 = 1. So, 4096 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, ( k^3 ≡ 1 mod 3 ), which implies ( k ≡ 1 mod 3 ). So, ( k = 3m + 1 ).So, substituting ( k = 3m + 1 ):( a = frac{(3m + 1)^3 - 4096}{3} )Compute ( (3m + 1)^3 = 27m^3 + 27m^2 + 9m + 1 ). Subtract 4096:( 27m^3 + 27m^2 + 9m + 1 - 4096 = 27m^3 + 27m^2 + 9m - 4095 )Divide by 3:( 9m^3 + 9m^2 + 3m - 1365 )So, ( a = 9m^3 + 9m^2 + 3m - 1365 ). For ( a ) to be positive:( 9m^3 + 9m^2 + 3m > 1365 )Let's find the smallest ( m ) such that this holds.Try ( m = 10 ):( 9000 + 900 + 30 = 9930 ), which is way larger than 1365.Wait, maybe ( m = 5 ):( 9*125 + 9*25 + 15 = 1125 + 225 + 15 = 1365 ). So, ( a = 1365 - 1365 = 0 ). Not positive.( m = 6 ):( 9*216 + 9*36 + 18 = 1944 + 324 + 18 = 2286 ). So, ( a = 2286 - 1365 = 921 ). Positive.So, for ( m geq 6 ), ( a ) is positive. Therefore, again, infinitely many ( a ).Wait, so in this case, even though ( n^6 ) was a cube, we still have infinitely many ( a ). So, perhaps my initial conclusion was correct.But wait, in the case of ( n = 4 ), I initially thought ( k ) had to be a multiple of 3, but that was incorrect because ( n^6 = 4096 ≡ 1 mod 3 ), so ( k^3 ≡ 1 mod 3 ), hence ( k ≡ 1 mod 3 ). So, ( k = 3m + 1 ), not ( 3m ). So, my mistake earlier was assuming ( k ) had to be a multiple of 3, but actually, it depends on ( n^6 ) mod 3.So, in general, ( n^6 ) mod 3: Since ( n ) is a natural number, ( n ) can be 0, 1, or 2 mod 3.But ( n^6 ):- If ( n ≡ 0 mod 3 ), ( n^6 ≡ 0 mod 3 )- If ( n ≡ 1 mod 3 ), ( n^6 ≡ 1 mod 3 )- If ( n ≡ 2 mod 3 ), ( 2^6 = 64 ≡ 1 mod 3 )So, ( n^6 ≡ 0 ) or ( 1 mod 3 ). Therefore, ( k^3 ≡ n^6 + 3a ≡ n^6 mod 3 ). So, if ( n^6 ≡ 0 mod 3 ), then ( k^3 ≡ 0 mod 3 ), so ( k ≡ 0 mod 3 ). If ( n^6 ≡ 1 mod 3 ), then ( k^3 ≡ 1 mod 3 ), so ( k ≡ 1 mod 3 ).Therefore, depending on ( n ), ( k ) is either ( 3m ) or ( 3m + 1 ). So, in both cases, we can express ( k ) in terms of ( m ), leading to a general expression for ( a ) in terms of ( m ), which is a polynomial in ( m ). Since ( m ) can be any positive integer beyond a certain point, ( a ) can take infinitely many values.Therefore, for any given ( n ), there are infinitely many ( a ) such that ( n^6 + 3a ) is a perfect cube. So, the answer should be A.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that for some ( n ), ( a ) cannot be positive? For example, if ( n ) is very large, does ( a ) necessarily become positive for some ( k )?Wait, for any ( n ), ( k ) can be chosen as ( n^2 + d ), where ( d ) is a positive integer. As ( d ) increases, ( k^3 ) increases, so ( a ) increases as well. Therefore, for sufficiently large ( d ), ( a ) will be positive. Hence, for each ( n ), there are infinitely many ( a ).Therefore, the correct answer is A: There are infinitely many such ( a ).**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"If m and n satisfy 3m-n-4=0, then 8^{m}div 2^{n}=______.","answer":"First, I need to find the relationship between ( m ) and ( n ) from the equation ( 3m - n - 4 = 0 ). Solving for ( n ), I get ( n = 3m - 4 ).Next, I'll substitute ( n ) into the expression ( 8^{m} div 2^{n} ). Since ( 8 ) is ( 2^3 ), I can rewrite ( 8^{m} ) as ( (2^3)^{m} ), which simplifies to ( 2^{3m} ).Now, the expression becomes ( 2^{3m} div 2^{n} ). Using the properties of exponents, this simplifies to ( 2^{3m - n} ).Substituting ( n = 3m - 4 ) into the exponent, I have ( 2^{3m - (3m - 4)} ), which simplifies to ( 2^{4} ).Finally, calculating ( 2^{4} ) gives me ( 16 )."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = x^3 - 12x + 8 on the interval [-3,3], the maximum and minimum values are M and m respectively. Find M - m.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = x³ - 12x + 8, and I need to find the maximum and minimum values on the interval [-3, 3]. Then, I have to calculate the difference between these two values, M - m. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that to find the maximum and minimum values of a function on a closed interval, I should check both the critical points inside the interval and the endpoints. Critical points are where the derivative is zero or undefined. Since this function is a polynomial, its derivative will also be a polynomial, which is defined everywhere, so I just need to find where the derivative is zero.Let me start by finding the derivative of f(x). The function is f(x) = x³ - 12x + 8, so the derivative f’(x) should be 3x² - 12. Yeah, that seems right. Now, I need to set this derivative equal to zero and solve for x to find the critical points.So, setting f’(x) = 0:3x² - 12 = 0Divide both sides by 3:x² - 4 = 0Factor:(x - 2)(x + 2) = 0So, x = 2 and x = -2.Alright, so the critical points are at x = -2 and x = 2. Both of these are within the interval [-3, 3], so I need to evaluate the function at these points as well as at the endpoints x = -3 and x = 3.Let me make a list of the points I need to evaluate:1. x = -32. x = -23. x = 24. x = 3Now, I need to compute f(x) for each of these.Starting with x = -3:f(-3) = (-3)³ - 12*(-3) + 8Calculate each term:(-3)³ = -27-12*(-3) = 36So, f(-3) = -27 + 36 + 8Let me add them up:-27 + 36 = 99 + 8 = 17So, f(-3) = 17.Next, x = -2:f(-2) = (-2)³ - 12*(-2) + 8Calculating each term:(-2)³ = -8-12*(-2) = 24So, f(-2) = -8 + 24 + 8Adding up:-8 + 24 = 1616 + 8 = 24So, f(-2) = 24.Moving on to x = 2:f(2) = (2)³ - 12*(2) + 8Calculating each term:2³ = 812*2 = 24So, f(2) = 8 - 24 + 8Adding up:8 - 24 = -16-16 + 8 = -8So, f(2) = -8.Lastly, x = 3:f(3) = (3)³ - 12*(3) + 8Calculating each term:3³ = 2712*3 = 36So, f(3) = 27 - 36 + 8Adding up:27 - 36 = -9-9 + 8 = -1So, f(3) = -1.Alright, so now I have all the function values:- f(-3) = 17- f(-2) = 24- f(2) = -8- f(3) = -1Looking at these values, the maximum value M is 24, which occurs at x = -2, and the minimum value m is -8, which occurs at x = 2.Therefore, the difference M - m is 24 - (-8). Let me compute that:24 - (-8) = 24 + 8 = 32.Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes when dealing with negative numbers.So, M is 24, m is -8. So, subtracting m from M is 24 - (-8) = 24 + 8 = 32. Yeah, that seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me verify each function evaluation again.Starting with f(-3):(-3)^3 is -27, correct.-12*(-3) is +36, correct.-27 + 36 is 9, plus 8 is 17. Correct.f(-2):(-2)^3 is -8, correct.-12*(-2) is +24, correct.-8 + 24 is 16, plus 8 is 24. Correct.f(2):2^3 is 8, correct.-12*2 is -24, correct.8 - 24 is -16, plus 8 is -8. Correct.f(3):3^3 is 27, correct.-12*3 is -36, correct.27 - 36 is -9, plus 8 is -1. Correct.So, all function evaluations are correct. Therefore, M is indeed 24, m is -8, so M - m is 32.Wait, just thinking, is there any chance I missed a critical point? Let me check the derivative again.f’(x) = 3x² - 12. Setting that equal to zero gives x² = 4, so x = ±2. So, only two critical points: x = -2 and x = 2. Both are within the interval [-3, 3], so I didn't miss any. So, I think my calculations are correct.Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum values is 32.**Final Answer**The difference between the maximum and minimum values is boxed{32}."},{"question":"If ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers that satisfy the equation ( 3 m^{3}=5 n^{5} ), the smallest possible value for ( m+n ) is:(A) 900(B) 450(C) 720(D) 810(E) 630","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers that satisfy the equation ( 3 m^{3} = 5 n^{5} ), the smallest possible value for ( m + n ) is... and then there are five options given. Hmm, I need to figure out what ( m ) and ( n ) are such that this equation holds, and then find the smallest sum of ( m ) and ( n ). Let me think about how to approach this.First, the equation is ( 3 m^{3} = 5 n^{5} ). So, both sides of the equation must be equal. Since ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers, I can think about prime factorizations here because both sides must have the same prime factors with the same exponents.Let me write the equation again:( 3 m^{3} = 5 n^{5} )So, if I consider the prime factors on both sides, the left side has a factor of 3 and the right side has a factor of 5. Therefore, both ( m ) and ( n ) must contain these primes in their factorizations to balance out the equation.Let me suppose that ( m ) is of the form ( m = 3^{a} times 5^{b} times k ), where ( k ) is some integer that doesn't contain 3 or 5 as factors. Similarly, ( n ) can be written as ( n = 3^{c} times 5^{d} times l ), where ( l ) is an integer without 3 or 5 as factors.But since the equation must hold, and the only primes involved are 3 and 5 (because otherwise, the other primes in ( k ) or ( l ) would cause the equation to not hold, as they wouldn't be present on the other side), I can actually say that ( k ) and ( l ) must be 1. So, ( m ) and ( n ) can only have 3 and 5 as prime factors.Therefore, let me write ( m = 3^{a} times 5^{b} ) and ( n = 3^{c} times 5^{d} ), where ( a, b, c, d ) are non-negative integers.Now, plugging these into the equation:Left side: ( 3 m^{3} = 3 times (3^{a} times 5^{b})^{3} = 3 times 3^{3a} times 5^{3b} = 3^{3a + 1} times 5^{3b} )Right side: ( 5 n^{5} = 5 times (3^{c} times 5^{d})^{5} = 5 times 3^{5c} times 5^{5d} = 3^{5c} times 5^{5d + 1} )Since these two expressions are equal, their prime factorizations must be equal. Therefore, the exponents of corresponding primes must be equal.So, for prime 3:( 3a + 1 = 5c )  ...(1)For prime 5:( 3b = 5d + 1 )  ...(2)So now, I have two equations:1. ( 3a + 1 = 5c )2. ( 3b = 5d + 1 )I need to find non-negative integers ( a, b, c, d ) that satisfy these equations.Let me tackle equation (1) first: ( 3a + 1 = 5c )I can rearrange this as ( 3a = 5c - 1 ). So, ( 5c - 1 ) must be divisible by 3. Let me write this as:( 5c equiv 1 mod 3 )Since 5 mod 3 is 2, this becomes:( 2c equiv 1 mod 3 )To solve for ( c ), I can multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 mod 3. The inverse of 2 mod 3 is 2, because ( 2 times 2 = 4 equiv 1 mod 3 ).So, multiplying both sides:( c equiv 2 times 1 mod 3 )( c equiv 2 mod 3 )Therefore, ( c = 3k + 2 ) for some integer ( k geq 0 ).Plugging back into equation (1):( 3a + 1 = 5(3k + 2) )( 3a + 1 = 15k + 10 )( 3a = 15k + 9 )( a = 5k + 3 )So, ( a = 5k + 3 ) and ( c = 3k + 2 ), where ( k ) is a non-negative integer.Now, moving on to equation (2): ( 3b = 5d + 1 )Similarly, rearrange this as ( 3b - 1 = 5d ). So, ( 3b - 1 ) must be divisible by 5.Expressed modulo 5:( 3b equiv 1 mod 5 )We can solve for ( b ). The inverse of 3 mod 5 is 2, because ( 3 times 2 = 6 equiv 1 mod 5 ).Multiplying both sides by 2:( b equiv 2 times 1 mod 5 )( b equiv 2 mod 5 )Therefore, ( b = 5m + 2 ) for some integer ( m geq 0 ).Plugging back into equation (2):( 3(5m + 2) = 5d + 1 )( 15m + 6 = 5d + 1 )( 15m + 5 = 5d )( 3m + 1 = d )So, ( d = 3m + 1 ) and ( b = 5m + 2 ), where ( m ) is a non-negative integer.Now, summarizing:From equation (1):- ( a = 5k + 3 )- ( c = 3k + 2 )From equation (2):- ( b = 5m + 2 )- ( d = 3m + 1 )So, ( m = 3^{a} times 5^{b} = 3^{5k + 3} times 5^{5m + 2} )And ( n = 3^{c} times 5^{d} = 3^{3k + 2} times 5^{3m + 1} )Our goal is to find the smallest possible ( m + n ). Since ( m ) and ( n ) are expressed in terms of ( k ) and ( m ), we need to find the smallest ( k ) and ( m ) such that ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers.But wait, actually, ( k ) and ( m ) are independent variables here. So, to minimize ( m + n ), we need to choose the smallest possible ( k ) and ( m ) that satisfy the equations.Let me see. Let's start with ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 0 ) and see if that works.If ( k = 0 ):- ( a = 5(0) + 3 = 3 )- ( c = 3(0) + 2 = 2 )If ( m = 0 ):- ( b = 5(0) + 2 = 2 )- ( d = 3(0) + 1 = 1 )So, plugging these into ( m ) and ( n ):( m = 3^{3} times 5^{2} = 27 times 25 = 675 )( n = 3^{2} times 5^{1} = 9 times 5 = 45 )So, ( m + n = 675 + 45 = 720 ). Hmm, 720 is one of the options, option (C). But let me check if this is indeed the minimal.Wait, but can ( k ) and ( m ) be negative? No, because ( k ) and ( m ) are non-negative integers. So, the smallest possible values are 0 for both.But let me check if ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 0 ) actually satisfy the original equation.Compute ( 3 m^{3} ) and ( 5 n^{5} ):First, ( m = 675 ), so ( m^3 = 675^3 ). That's a huge number. Similarly, ( n = 45 ), so ( n^5 = 45^5 ). Let me see if ( 3 times 675^3 = 5 times 45^5 ).But instead of computing the actual numbers, maybe I can factor them.( m = 3^3 times 5^2 )So, ( m^3 = (3^3 times 5^2)^3 = 3^9 times 5^6 )Thus, ( 3 m^3 = 3^{10} times 5^6 )Similarly, ( n = 3^2 times 5^1 )So, ( n^5 = (3^2 times 5^1)^5 = 3^{10} times 5^5 )Thus, ( 5 n^5 = 5 times 3^{10} times 5^5 = 3^{10} times 5^6 )Yes, so both sides are equal. So, ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 0 ) give a valid solution with ( m + n = 720 ).But wait, the options include 450, which is smaller than 720. So, maybe I can get a smaller sum by choosing different ( k ) and ( m ). But how?Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming ( k ) and ( m ) have to be zero. Let me think again.Actually, ( k ) and ( m ) are independent variables. So, perhaps choosing different ( k ) and ( m ) can lead to smaller ( m + n ).Wait, but if I set ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 0 ), that gives me the minimal exponents, so I think that should give me the minimal ( m ) and ( n ). But let me check.Wait, perhaps I can set ( k = 1 ) and ( m = 0 ) or ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 1 ), and see if that gives a smaller sum.Let me try ( k = 1 ) and ( m = 0 ):If ( k = 1 ):- ( a = 5(1) + 3 = 8 )- ( c = 3(1) + 2 = 5 )If ( m = 0 ):- ( b = 5(0) + 2 = 2 )- ( d = 3(0) + 1 = 1 )So, ( m = 3^{8} times 5^{2} = 6561 times 25 = 164025 )( n = 3^{5} times 5^{1} = 243 times 5 = 1215 )Thus, ( m + n = 164025 + 1215 = 165240 ), which is way bigger than 720.Similarly, if I set ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 1 ):( k = 0 ):- ( a = 3 )- ( c = 2 )( m = 1 ):- ( b = 5(1) + 2 = 7 )- ( d = 3(1) + 1 = 4 )So, ( m = 3^{3} times 5^{7} = 27 times 78125 = 2109375 )( n = 3^{2} times 5^{4} = 9 times 625 = 5625 )Thus, ( m + n = 2109375 + 5625 = 2115000 ), which is even bigger.Hmm, so increasing ( k ) or ( m ) beyond 0 just makes ( m ) and ( n ) larger, so the sum ( m + n ) increases.Wait, but maybe if I set ( k = 1 ) and ( m = 1 ), but that would be even worse.Alternatively, perhaps I can set ( k = -1 ) or ( m = -1 ), but no, ( k ) and ( m ) have to be non-negative integers because exponents can't be negative in prime factorizations.So, perhaps 720 is indeed the minimal sum. But wait, the options include 450, which is smaller. So, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, let me think again. Maybe I can choose different exponents for ( m ) and ( n ) without necessarily setting ( k ) and ( m ) to 0. Maybe there's a different way to express ( m ) and ( n ) such that the exponents are smaller.Wait, let me go back to the original equation:( 3 m^3 = 5 n^5 )So, ( m^3 ) must be divisible by 5, and ( n^5 ) must be divisible by 3. Therefore, ( m ) must be divisible by 5, and ( n ) must be divisible by 3.So, let me write ( m = 5 p ) and ( n = 3 q ), where ( p ) and ( q ) are positive integers.Substituting into the equation:( 3 (5 p)^3 = 5 (3 q)^5 )( 3 times 125 p^3 = 5 times 243 q^5 )( 375 p^3 = 1215 q^5 )Simplify both sides by dividing by 15:( 25 p^3 = 81 q^5 )So, now, the equation is ( 25 p^3 = 81 q^5 ). So, similar to before, both sides must have the same prime factors.25 is ( 5^2 ) and 81 is ( 3^4 ). So, ( p ) must be divisible by 3, and ( q ) must be divisible by 5.So, let me write ( p = 3 r ) and ( q = 5 s ), where ( r ) and ( s ) are positive integers.Substituting:( 25 (3 r)^3 = 81 (5 s)^5 )( 25 times 27 r^3 = 81 times 3125 s^5 )( 675 r^3 = 253125 s^5 )Simplify both sides by dividing by 675:( r^3 = 375 s^5 )Wait, 253125 divided by 675: Let me compute that.253125 ÷ 675: 675 × 375 = 253125, right? 675 × 300 = 202500, 675 × 75 = 50625, so 202500 + 50625 = 253125. Yes, so 253125 ÷ 675 = 375.So, we have ( r^3 = 375 s^5 )Again, 375 is ( 3 times 5^3 ). So, ( r^3 ) must be divisible by 3 and 5^3, so ( r ) must be divisible by 3 and 5.Let me write ( r = 3 t times 5 u ), but actually, to make it simpler, let me write ( r = 3 t times 5 u ), but perhaps I should just write ( r = 15 t ), since it needs to be divisible by both 3 and 5.Wait, but actually, let's factor 375:375 = 3 × 5^3So, ( r^3 = 3 times 5^3 times s^5 )So, for ( r^3 ) to be equal to that, the exponents on both sides must match.So, let me write ( r = 3^{a} times 5^{b} times k ), but again, since the right side only has 3 and 5, ( k ) must be 1. So, ( r = 3^{a} times 5^{b} )Then, ( r^3 = 3^{3a} times 5^{3b} )And the right side is ( 3^{1} times 5^{3} times s^5 ). So, ( s ) must also be in terms of 3 and 5.Let me write ( s = 3^{c} times 5^{d} )Therefore, ( s^5 = 3^{5c} times 5^{5d} )So, the right side becomes ( 3^{1 + 5c} times 5^{3 + 5d} )Therefore, equating exponents:For prime 3:( 3a = 1 + 5c ) ...(3)For prime 5:( 3b = 3 + 5d ) ...(4)So, now, equations (3) and (4):Equation (3): ( 3a = 5c + 1 )Equation (4): ( 3b = 5d + 3 )We need to find non-negative integers ( a, c, b, d ) satisfying these.Starting with equation (3): ( 3a = 5c + 1 )So, ( 5c + 1 ) must be divisible by 3.Expressed modulo 3:( 5c + 1 equiv 0 mod 3 )( 2c + 1 equiv 0 mod 3 )( 2c equiv -1 mod 3 )( 2c equiv 2 mod 3 )Multiply both sides by inverse of 2 mod 3, which is 2:( c equiv 4 mod 3 )( c equiv 1 mod 3 )So, ( c = 3k + 1 ) for some integer ( k geq 0 )Plugging back into equation (3):( 3a = 5(3k + 1) + 1 = 15k + 5 + 1 = 15k + 6 )( a = 5k + 2 )So, ( a = 5k + 2 ) and ( c = 3k + 1 )Now, moving to equation (4): ( 3b = 5d + 3 )Rearranged: ( 5d = 3b - 3 )So, ( 3b - 3 ) must be divisible by 5.Expressed modulo 5:( 3b - 3 equiv 0 mod 5 )( 3b equiv 3 mod 5 )Divide both sides by 3 (which is invertible mod 5, since gcd(3,5)=1). The inverse of 3 mod 5 is 2, because 3×2=6≡1 mod5.So, multiplying both sides by 2:( b equiv 6 mod 5 )( b equiv 1 mod 5 )Thus, ( b = 5m + 1 ) for some integer ( m geq 0 )Plugging back into equation (4):( 3(5m + 1) = 5d + 3 )( 15m + 3 = 5d + 3 )( 15m = 5d )( 3m = d )So, ( d = 3m ) and ( b = 5m + 1 )So, summarizing:From equation (3):- ( a = 5k + 2 )- ( c = 3k + 1 )From equation (4):- ( b = 5m + 1 )- ( d = 3m )Now, going back up, we had:( r = 3^{a} times 5^{b} = 3^{5k + 2} times 5^{5m + 1} )( s = 3^{c} times 5^{d} = 3^{3k + 1} times 5^{3m} )Then, earlier, we had:( p = 3 r = 3 times 3^{5k + 2} times 5^{5m + 1} = 3^{5k + 3} times 5^{5m + 1} )( q = 5 s = 5 times 3^{3k + 1} times 5^{3m} = 3^{3k + 1} times 5^{3m + 1} )Then, going back to ( m = 5 p = 5 times 3^{5k + 3} times 5^{5m + 1} = 3^{5k + 3} times 5^{5m + 2} )And ( n = 3 q = 3 times 3^{3k + 1} times 5^{3m + 1} = 3^{3k + 2} times 5^{3m + 1} )Wait, this seems similar to what I had earlier, except that now, in this substitution, ( r = 3^{5k + 2} times 5^{5m + 1} ) and so on. So, perhaps I'm going in circles.But regardless, the expressions for ( m ) and ( n ) are the same as before.So, to find the minimal ( m + n ), I need to choose the smallest ( k ) and ( m ) such that ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers. Since ( k ) and ( m ) are independent, the minimal values are ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 0 ).So, plugging ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 0 ):( m = 3^{5(0) + 3} times 5^{5(0) + 2} = 3^3 times 5^2 = 27 times 25 = 675 )( n = 3^{3(0) + 2} times 5^{3(0) + 1} = 3^2 times 5^1 = 9 times 5 = 45 )Thus, ( m + n = 675 + 45 = 720 )But wait, the options include 450, which is smaller. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my substitution somewhere.Wait, let's see. Maybe I can choose different ( k ) and ( m ) such that ( m ) and ( n ) are smaller.Wait, but if I set ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 0 ), that gives me the minimal exponents, so I think that should give me the minimal ( m ) and ( n ). But let me check if there's another way to express ( m ) and ( n ) with smaller exponents.Wait, let me think about the original equation again: ( 3 m^3 = 5 n^5 ). So, ( m^3 ) must be a multiple of 5, and ( n^5 ) must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, ( m ) must be a multiple of 5, and ( n ) must be a multiple of 3.So, let me write ( m = 5 a ) and ( n = 3 b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers.Substituting into the equation:( 3 (5 a)^3 = 5 (3 b)^5 )( 3 times 125 a^3 = 5 times 243 b^5 )( 375 a^3 = 1215 b^5 )Divide both sides by 15:( 25 a^3 = 81 b^5 )So, now, ( 25 a^3 = 81 b^5 ). So, ( a^3 ) must be a multiple of 81, and ( b^5 ) must be a multiple of 25.So, ( a ) must be a multiple of 3, and ( b ) must be a multiple of 5.Let me write ( a = 3 c ) and ( b = 5 d ), where ( c ) and ( d ) are positive integers.Substituting:( 25 (3 c)^3 = 81 (5 d)^5 )( 25 times 27 c^3 = 81 times 3125 d^5 )( 675 c^3 = 253125 d^5 )Divide both sides by 675:( c^3 = 375 d^5 )So, ( c^3 = 375 d^5 ). Now, 375 is ( 3 times 5^3 ). So, ( c^3 ) must be divisible by 3 and 5^3, meaning ( c ) must be divisible by 3 and 5.Let me write ( c = 15 e ), where ( e ) is a positive integer.Substituting:( (15 e)^3 = 375 d^5 )( 3375 e^3 = 375 d^5 )Divide both sides by 375:( 9 e^3 = d^5 )So, ( d^5 = 9 e^3 ). Therefore, ( d^5 ) must be divisible by 9, so ( d ) must be divisible by 3.Let me write ( d = 3 f ), where ( f ) is a positive integer.Substituting:( (3 f)^5 = 9 e^3 )( 243 f^5 = 9 e^3 )Divide both sides by 9:( 27 f^5 = e^3 )So, ( e^3 = 27 f^5 ). Therefore, ( e ) must be divisible by 3.Let me write ( e = 3 g ), where ( g ) is a positive integer.Substituting:( (3 g)^3 = 27 f^5 )( 27 g^3 = 27 f^5 )Divide both sides by 27:( g^3 = f^5 )So, ( g^3 = f^5 ). Therefore, ( g ) must be a fifth power, and ( f ) must be a cube. Let me write ( g = h^5 ) and ( f = h^3 ), where ( h ) is a positive integer.So, ( g = h^5 ) and ( f = h^3 ).Now, let's backtrack:( e = 3 g = 3 h^5 )( d = 3 f = 3 h^3 )( c = 15 e = 15 times 3 h^5 = 45 h^5 )( b = 5 d = 5 times 3 h^3 = 15 h^3 )( a = 3 c = 3 times 45 h^5 = 135 h^5 )( m = 5 a = 5 times 135 h^5 = 675 h^5 )( n = 3 b = 3 times 15 h^3 = 45 h^3 )Therefore, ( m = 675 h^5 ) and ( n = 45 h^3 ). So, ( m + n = 675 h^5 + 45 h^3 ).To find the minimal ( m + n ), we need the smallest ( h ). Since ( h ) is a positive integer, the smallest value is ( h = 1 ).So, plugging ( h = 1 ):( m = 675 times 1 = 675 )( n = 45 times 1 = 45 )( m + n = 675 + 45 = 720 )So, again, we get 720 as the minimal sum. But the options include 450, which is smaller. So, maybe I missed something.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitutions. Let me check.Wait, when I set ( g = h^5 ) and ( f = h^3 ), that's correct because ( g^3 = f^5 ) implies ( g = f^{5/3} ), so ( f ) must be a cube, say ( f = k^3 ), then ( g = k^5 ). So, yes, that substitution is correct.Therefore, it seems that 720 is indeed the minimal sum. But the options have 450, which is smaller. Maybe I need to check if there's a different way to express ( m ) and ( n ) without going through all these substitutions.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the exponents in the prime factorizations.Given ( 3 m^3 = 5 n^5 ), the exponents of 3 and 5 on both sides must match.Let me denote the exponents of 3 in ( m ) as ( x ) and in ( n ) as ( y ). Similarly, the exponents of 5 in ( m ) as ( z ) and in ( n ) as ( w ).So, ( m = 3^x times 5^z ) and ( n = 3^y times 5^w ).Then, ( m^3 = 3^{3x} times 5^{3z} ) and ( n^5 = 3^{5y} times 5^{5w} ).So, the equation ( 3 m^3 = 5 n^5 ) becomes:( 3 times 3^{3x} times 5^{3z} = 5 times 3^{5y} times 5^{5w} )Simplify:Left side: ( 3^{3x + 1} times 5^{3z} )Right side: ( 3^{5y} times 5^{5w + 1} )Therefore, equating exponents:For prime 3:( 3x + 1 = 5y ) ...(A)For prime 5:( 3z = 5w + 1 ) ...(B)So, we have two equations:1. ( 3x + 1 = 5y )2. ( 3z = 5w + 1 )We need to find the smallest positive integers ( x, y, z, w ) that satisfy these.Starting with equation (A): ( 3x + 1 = 5y )We can write this as ( 3x = 5y - 1 ). So, ( 5y - 1 ) must be divisible by 3.So, ( 5y equiv 1 mod 3 ). Since 5 ≡ 2 mod 3, this becomes ( 2y equiv 1 mod 3 ).Multiplying both sides by 2 (the inverse of 2 mod 3 is 2):( 4y ≡ 2 mod 3 )( y ≡ 2 mod 3 )So, the smallest positive integer ( y ) is 2. Then, ( x = (5y - 1)/3 = (10 - 1)/3 = 3 ).So, ( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ).Now, equation (B): ( 3z = 5w + 1 )Similarly, ( 5w + 1 ) must be divisible by 3.So, ( 5w ≡ -1 mod 3 )( 2w ≡ 2 mod 3 )Multiply both sides by 2:( 4w ≡ 4 mod 3 )( w ≡ 1 mod 3 )So, the smallest positive integer ( w ) is 1. Then, ( z = (5w + 1)/3 = (5 + 1)/3 = 2 ).So, ( z = 2 ), ( w = 1 ).Therefore, the minimal exponents are:( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ), ( z = 2 ), ( w = 1 )Thus, ( m = 3^3 times 5^2 = 27 times 25 = 675 )( n = 3^2 times 5^1 = 9 times 5 = 45 )So, ( m + n = 675 + 45 = 720 )Again, 720. So, it seems that 720 is indeed the minimal sum. But why is 450 an option? Maybe I need to check if there's a different way to interpret the problem or if I made a mistake in my calculations.Wait, perhaps I can consider that ( m ) and ( n ) don't have to be only multiples of 3 and 5. But no, because the equation ( 3 m^3 = 5 n^5 ) requires that ( m ) must be divisible by 5 and ( n ) must be divisible by 3, otherwise, the equation can't hold.Wait, let me check if ( m = 450 ) and ( n = 150 ) satisfy the equation. Wait, 450 is an option, but let me see.If ( m = 450 ), then ( m^3 = 450^3 ). Let me compute ( 3 m^3 ):( 3 times 450^3 = 3 times (450 times 450 times 450) ). That's a huge number.Similarly, if ( n = 150 ), then ( n^5 = 150^5 ). Let me compute ( 5 n^5 ):( 5 times 150^5 ). Again, a huge number.But instead of computing the actual numbers, let me factor them.( m = 450 = 2 times 3^2 times 5^2 )So, ( m^3 = (2 times 3^2 times 5^2)^3 = 2^3 times 3^6 times 5^6 )Thus, ( 3 m^3 = 3 times 2^3 times 3^6 times 5^6 = 2^3 times 3^7 times 5^6 )( n = 150 = 2 times 3 times 5^2 )So, ( n^5 = (2 times 3 times 5^2)^5 = 2^5 times 3^5 times 5^{10} )Thus, ( 5 n^5 = 5 times 2^5 times 3^5 times 5^{10} = 2^5 times 3^5 times 5^{11} )Comparing ( 3 m^3 ) and ( 5 n^5 ):( 2^3 times 3^7 times 5^6 ) vs. ( 2^5 times 3^5 times 5^{11} )These are not equal because the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 don't match. So, 450 and 150 don't satisfy the equation.Wait, perhaps another pair. Let me think.Wait, maybe ( m = 225 ) and ( n = 81 ). Let's check.( m = 225 = 3^2 times 5^2 )( m^3 = 3^6 times 5^6 )( 3 m^3 = 3^7 times 5^6 )( n = 81 = 3^4 )( n^5 = 3^{20} )( 5 n^5 = 5 times 3^{20} )These are not equal because 5^6 vs. 5^1 and 3^7 vs. 3^{20}.Nope, doesn't work.Wait, maybe ( m = 135 ) and ( n = 81 ). Let's see.( m = 135 = 3^3 times 5 )( m^3 = 3^9 times 5^3 )( 3 m^3 = 3^{10} times 5^3 )( n = 81 = 3^4 )( n^5 = 3^{20} )( 5 n^5 = 5 times 3^{20} )Again, not equal.Wait, maybe ( m = 225 ) and ( n = 225 ). Let's see.( m = 225 = 3^2 times 5^2 )( m^3 = 3^6 times 5^6 )( 3 m^3 = 3^7 times 5^6 )( n = 225 = 3^2 times 5^2 )( n^5 = 3^{10} times 5^{10} )( 5 n^5 = 5 times 3^{10} times 5^{10} = 3^{10} times 5^{11} )Not equal.Wait, maybe ( m = 225 ) and ( n = 135 ).( m = 225 = 3^2 times 5^2 )( m^3 = 3^6 times 5^6 )( 3 m^3 = 3^7 times 5^6 )( n = 135 = 3^3 times 5 )( n^5 = 3^{15} times 5^5 )( 5 n^5 = 5 times 3^{15} times 5^5 = 3^{15} times 5^6 )So, ( 3 m^3 = 3^7 times 5^6 ) vs. ( 5 n^5 = 3^{15} times 5^6 ). Not equal.Wait, maybe ( m = 405 ) and ( n = 135 ).( m = 405 = 3^4 times 5 )( m^3 = 3^{12} times 5^3 )( 3 m^3 = 3^{13} times 5^3 )( n = 135 = 3^3 times 5 )( n^5 = 3^{15} times 5^5 )( 5 n^5 = 5 times 3^{15} times 5^5 = 3^{15} times 5^6 )Not equal.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since all my substitutions and prime factorizations lead me to ( m = 675 ) and ( n = 45 ), giving ( m + n = 720 ), which is one of the options, and all other attempts to find smaller ( m + n ) don't satisfy the equation, I think 720 is indeed the correct answer.But wait, the options include 450, which is smaller. Maybe I made a mistake in my initial assumption that ( k ) and ( m ) have to be zero. Let me think again.Wait, perhaps I can choose ( k = 1 ) and ( m = 1 ), but that would make ( m ) and ( n ) larger, as I saw earlier. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to express ( m ) and ( n ) with smaller exponents.Wait, let me think about the exponents in the prime factorizations again.We have:( 3 m^3 = 5 n^5 )Expressed as:( 3^{1} times m^3 = 5^{1} times n^5 )So, ( m^3 ) must provide the necessary factors to balance both sides. So, ( m ) must include factors of 5 to compensate for the 5 on the right, and ( n ) must include factors of 3 to compensate for the 3 on the left.But perhaps, instead of setting ( m = 5 p ) and ( n = 3 q ), I can set ( m = 5^a times 3^b ) and ( n = 5^c times 3^d ), and find exponents ( a, b, c, d ) such that the equation holds.So, let me write:( m = 5^a times 3^b )( n = 5^c times 3^d )Then, ( m^3 = 5^{3a} times 3^{3b} )( n^5 = 5^{5c} times 3^{5d} )So, the equation becomes:( 3 times 5^{3a} times 3^{3b} = 5 times 5^{5c} times 3^{5d} )Simplify:Left side: ( 3^{3b + 1} times 5^{3a} )Right side: ( 3^{5d} times 5^{5c + 1} )Therefore, equating exponents:For prime 3:( 3b + 1 = 5d ) ...(C)For prime 5:( 3a = 5c + 1 ) ...(D)So, equations (C) and (D):1. ( 3b + 1 = 5d )2. ( 3a = 5c + 1 )These are similar to the equations I had earlier. Let me solve them.Starting with equation (C): ( 3b + 1 = 5d )This is similar to equation (1) earlier. So, ( 3b = 5d - 1 ). So, ( 5d - 1 ) must be divisible by 3.Expressed modulo 3:( 5d ≡ 1 mod 3 )( 2d ≡ 1 mod 3 )Multiply both sides by 2:( 4d ≡ 2 mod 3 )( d ≡ 2 mod 3 )So, ( d = 3k + 2 ) for some integer ( k geq 0 )Plugging back into equation (C):( 3b + 1 = 5(3k + 2) )( 3b + 1 = 15k + 10 )( 3b = 15k + 9 )( b = 5k + 3 )So, ( b = 5k + 3 ) and ( d = 3k + 2 )Now, equation (D): ( 3a = 5c + 1 )This is similar to equation (2) earlier. So, ( 5c + 1 ) must be divisible by 3.Expressed modulo 3:( 5c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 3 )( 2c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 3 )( 2c ≡ -1 mod 3 )( 2c ≡ 2 mod 3 )Multiply both sides by 2:( 4c ≡ 4 mod 3 )( c ≡ 1 mod 3 )So, ( c = 3m + 1 ) for some integer ( m geq 0 )Plugging back into equation (D):( 3a = 5(3m + 1) + 1 = 15m + 5 + 1 = 15m + 6 )( a = 5m + 2 )So, ( a = 5m + 2 ) and ( c = 3m + 1 )Therefore, ( m = 5^a times 3^b = 5^{5m + 2} times 3^{5k + 3} )And ( n = 5^c times 3^d = 5^{3m + 1} times 3^{3k + 2} )To find the minimal ( m + n ), we need to choose the smallest ( k ) and ( m ). Let's set ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 0 ):( m = 5^{2} times 3^{3} = 25 times 27 = 675 )( n = 5^{1} times 3^{2} = 5 times 9 = 45 )Thus, ( m + n = 675 + 45 = 720 )Again, 720. So, it seems that regardless of how I approach this, 720 is the minimal sum. Therefore, the answer should be 720, which is option (C).But wait, the options are:(A) 900(B) 450(C) 720(D) 810(E) 630So, 720 is option (C). Therefore, the answer is (C) 720.But just to be thorough, let me check if there's a way to get a smaller sum by choosing different ( k ) and ( m ). For example, if I set ( k = 1 ) and ( m = 0 ):( m = 5^{2} times 3^{8} = 25 times 6561 = 164025 )( n = 5^{1} times 3^{5} = 5 times 243 = 1215 )Sum: 164025 + 1215 = 165240, which is way bigger.If I set ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 1 ):( m = 5^{7} times 3^{3} = 78125 times 27 = 2109375 )( n = 5^{4} times 3^{2} = 625 times 9 = 5625 )Sum: 2109375 + 5625 = 2115000, which is even bigger.So, indeed, 720 is the smallest possible sum.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"If the function f(x) = x^2 + ax - 1 is an even function, then a= ___.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If the function ( f(x) = x^2 + ax - 1 ) is an even function, then what is ( a )? Hmm, I remember that even functions have some specific properties, but I need to recall exactly what they are. Let me think.An even function is one where ( f(-x) = f(x) ) for all ( x ) in the domain of ( f ). That means if I plug in ( -x ) into the function, it should give me the same result as plugging in ( x ). So, I can use this property to find the value of ( a ).Alright, let's write down the function again: ( f(x) = x^2 + ax - 1 ). Now, I need to compute ( f(-x) ) and set it equal to ( f(x) ) to see what conditions that imposes on ( a ).Calculating ( f(-x) ), I substitute ( -x ) in place of ( x ) in the function:( f(-x) = (-x)^2 + a(-x) - 1 ).Let me simplify that step by step. First, ( (-x)^2 ) is the same as ( x^2 ) because squaring a negative number gives a positive result. So, that term becomes ( x^2 ).Next, the middle term is ( a(-x) ), which simplifies to ( -ax ).The last term is just ( -1 ), so it remains the same.Putting it all together, ( f(-x) = x^2 - ax - 1 ).Now, since the function is even, ( f(-x) ) must equal ( f(x) ). So, let's set them equal to each other:( x^2 - ax - 1 = x^2 + ax - 1 ).Hmm, okay. Now, let's subtract ( x^2 ) and add 1 to both sides to simplify the equation. That would cancel out the ( x^2 ) and the constant terms on both sides.Subtracting ( x^2 ) from both sides:( -ax - 1 = ax - 1 ).Wait, no, actually, if I subtract ( x^2 ) and add 1, it would be:Left side: ( x^2 - ax - 1 - x^2 + 1 = -ax ).Right side: ( x^2 + ax - 1 - x^2 + 1 = ax ).So, simplifying, we get:( -ax = ax ).Hmm, that seems right. So, ( -ax = ax ). Let me write that as:( -ax = ax ).Now, to solve for ( a ), I can bring all terms to one side. Let's add ( ax ) to both sides:( -ax + ax = ax + ax ).Simplifying, the left side becomes 0, and the right side becomes ( 2ax ):( 0 = 2ax ).So, ( 2ax = 0 ).Now, this equation must hold for all ( x ) in the domain of ( f ). Since ( x ) can be any real number (because the function is a polynomial and polynomials are defined for all real numbers), the only way this equation can be true for all ( x ) is if ( 2a = 0 ).So, solving for ( a ):( 2a = 0 ) implies ( a = 0 ).Wait, let me double-check that. If ( a = 0 ), then the function becomes ( f(x) = x^2 - 1 ). Is that an even function?Yes, because ( f(-x) = (-x)^2 - 1 = x^2 - 1 = f(x) ). So, that works.Alternatively, if I plug ( a = 0 ) back into the original equation, I get:( f(x) = x^2 + 0x - 1 = x^2 - 1 ), which is indeed even.So, that seems correct. Therefore, ( a = 0 ).But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my algebra, let me go through the steps again.Starting with ( f(x) = x^2 + ax - 1 ).Compute ( f(-x) ):( f(-x) = (-x)^2 + a(-x) - 1 = x^2 - ax - 1 ).Set ( f(-x) = f(x) ):( x^2 - ax - 1 = x^2 + ax - 1 ).Subtract ( x^2 ) and add 1 to both sides:Left side: ( x^2 - ax - 1 - x^2 + 1 = -ax ).Right side: ( x^2 + ax - 1 - x^2 + 1 = ax ).So, ( -ax = ax ).Adding ( ax ) to both sides:( 0 = 2ax ).Since this must hold for all ( x ), ( 2a = 0 ) which gives ( a = 0 ).Yep, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that ( a = 0 ) is the correct answer.Another way to think about it is that even functions have symmetry about the y-axis. The term with ( x ) is a linear term, which is an odd function. For the entire function to be even, the odd parts must cancel out. In this case, the only odd term is ( ax ). So, to eliminate the odd component, ( a ) must be zero.Alternatively, if I consider the definition of even functions, the coefficients of all odd-powered terms must be zero. In the function ( f(x) = x^2 + ax - 1 ), the term ( x^2 ) is even, the constant term ( -1 ) is even (since constants are even functions), and the term ( ax ) is odd. Therefore, to make the entire function even, the coefficient ( a ) must be zero.So, all these different ways of thinking about it lead me to the same conclusion: ( a = 0 ).I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me test ( a = 0 ) in the original function.If ( a = 0 ), then ( f(x) = x^2 - 1 ). Let's compute ( f(-x) ):( f(-x) = (-x)^2 - 1 = x^2 - 1 = f(x) ).Yes, that's exactly the definition of an even function. So, it works.What if ( a ) wasn't zero? Let's say ( a = 1 ). Then, ( f(x) = x^2 + x - 1 ). Compute ( f(-x) ):( f(-x) = (-x)^2 + (-x) - 1 = x^2 - x - 1 ).Compare that to ( f(x) = x^2 + x - 1 ). These are not equal unless ( x = 0 ). So, the function isn't even when ( a = 1 ).Similarly, if ( a = -1 ), ( f(-x) = x^2 + x - 1 ), which is the same as ( f(x) ) when ( a = 1 ). So, unless ( a = 0 ), the function isn't even.Therefore, the only value of ( a ) that makes ( f(x) ) even is zero.I think that's solid. I can't see any errors in my reasoning, and all my checks confirm that ( a = 0 ) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Yuri has n cards with numbers from 1 to n. After Yuri lost one of them, the sum of the numbers on the remaining cards was 101. What number is written on the lost card?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total sum of the numbers on all ( n ) cards before any were lost. Since the cards are numbered from 1 to ( n ), the sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers: ( frac{n(n + 1)}{2} ).After losing one card, the sum of the remaining cards is 101. This means that the number on the lost card is the difference between the total sum and 101. Therefore, the lost number can be expressed as ( frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 101 ).To find the specific value of ( n ), I'll set up the equation ( frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 101 = x ), where ( x ) is the number on the lost card. Since ( x ) must be an integer between 1 and ( n ), I'll solve for ( n ) such that ( frac{n(n + 1)}{2} ) is just greater than 101.By testing values, I find that when ( n = 14 ), the total sum is ( frac{14 times 15}{2} = 105 ).

How many candies did Tracy have at the start?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about Tracy and her candies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'll write down everything as I go along.First, Tracy starts with a bag of candies. Let's call the number of candies she starts with \\"C\\". The problem says none of the candies can be broken into pieces, so all the numbers we deal with should be whole numbers. That might be important later.Tracy ate 1/3 of them. So, she ate (1/3) * C candies. That means she has C - (1/3)C left. Let me compute that: C - (1/3)C is equal to (2/3)C. So, after eating, Tracy has two-thirds of her original candies left.Then, she gave 1/4 of what remained to her friend Rachel. So, she gave away (1/4) * (2/3)C. Let me calculate that: (1/4)*(2/3)C is (2/12)C, which simplifies to (1/6)C. So, Tracy gave Rachel 1/6 of the original number of candies.Now, how many candies does Tracy have left after giving some to Rachel? She had (2/3)C and gave away (1/6)C, so subtracting that: (2/3)C - (1/6)C. To subtract these fractions, they need a common denominator. 2/3 is equal to 4/6, so 4/6C - 1/6C is 3/6C, which simplifies to 1/2C. So, Tracy now has half of her original candies left.Next, Tracy and her mom each ate 15 candies from what Tracy had left. So, Tracy ate 15, her mom ate 15, that's a total of 30 candies eaten. So, Tracy had (1/2)C candies, and then she subtracts 30. So, she has (1/2)C - 30 candies left.Then, Tracy's brother took somewhere from one to five candies, leaving Tracy with three candies. So, after her brother took some candies, she had three left. That means before her brother took the candies, she had 3 + (number of candies brother took). Since her brother took between 1 and 5, that means she had between 4 and 8 candies before her brother took some.So, let's write that down. After Tracy and her mom ate 15 each, she had (1/2)C - 30 candies left. Then her brother took some candies, and she was left with 3. So:(1/2)C - 30 - (brother's candies) = 3But the brother took between 1 and 5 candies, so:(1/2)C - 30 - x = 3, where x is between 1 and 5.Let me rearrange that equation:(1/2)C - 30 - x = 3So, (1/2)C - 30 = 3 + xTherefore, (1/2)C = 33 + xWhich means, C = 2*(33 + x) = 66 + 2xSince x is between 1 and 5, C is between 66 + 2*1 = 68 and 66 + 2*5 = 76.So, C is somewhere between 68 and 76.But we also know that C must be a number such that when Tracy ate 1/3, and then gave 1/4 of the remainder to Rachel, all those operations result in whole numbers. So, C must be divisible by 3 because she ate 1/3 of them. Also, after she ate 1/3, she had 2/3 C left, which must be divisible by 4 because she gave 1/4 of that to Rachel. So, 2/3 C must be divisible by 4.Let me write that down:C must be divisible by 3.Also, (2/3)C must be divisible by 4.So, (2/3)C divisible by 4 implies that (2/3)C is a multiple of 4. Let me write that as (2/3)C = 4k, where k is an integer.Multiplying both sides by 3/2, we get C = (4k)*(3/2) = 6k.So, C must be a multiple of 6.So, C is a multiple of 6, and between 68 and 76.Let me list the multiples of 6 in that range:68: 6*11=66, 6*12=72, 6*13=78.Wait, 72 is within 68-76, but 78 is above 76. So, the only multiple of 6 between 68 and 76 is 72.So, C must be 72.Wait, but let me check if that works.Let me test C=72.First, Tracy ate 1/3 of them: 72*(1/3)=24. So, she ate 24, left with 72-24=48.Then, she gave 1/4 of the remainder to Rachel: 48*(1/4)=12. So, Rachel got 12, Tracy has 48-12=36 left.Then, Tracy and her mom each ate 15: Tracy ate 15, mom ate 15, so total 30. 36-30=6.Then, Tracy's brother took somewhere from 1 to 5 candies, leaving her with 3. So, Tracy had 6 before her brother took some. So, brother took 6 - 3 = 3 candies. That's within 1 to 5, so that works.So, C=72 seems to satisfy all the conditions.But wait, earlier I thought C could be between 68 and 76, but only 72 is a multiple of 6. So, 72 is the only candidate.But let me check if there's another multiple of 6 in that range. 6*11=66, which is below 68, and 6*12=72, 6*13=78, which is above 76. So, yes, 72 is the only multiple of 6 between 68 and 76.Therefore, Tracy must have started with 72 candies.But just to make sure, let me go through the steps again with C=72.1. Tracy starts with 72.2. Eats 1/3: 72*(1/3)=24, so she has 72-24=48 left.3. Gives 1/4 of 48 to Rachel: 48*(1/4)=12, so she has 48-12=36 left.4. Tracy and her mom each eat 15: 36 -15 -15=6 left.5. Brother takes between 1-5, leaving her with 3. So, 6 - x =3, so x=3, which is within 1-5.All steps check out. So, 72 is the correct answer.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**Tracy had boxed{72} candies at the start."},{"question":"n is a 1996-digit integer and is a multiple of 9. The sum of the digits of n is p, the sum of the digits of p is q, and the sum of the digits of q is r. Find the value of r.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where n is a 1996-digit integer and it's a multiple of 9. I need to find the value of r, which is the sum of the digits of q, where q is the sum of the digits of p, and p is the sum of the digits of n. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.First, I know that if a number is a multiple of 9, then the sum of its digits is also a multiple of 9. That's a property of numbers divisible by 9. So, since n is a multiple of 9, p, which is the sum of its digits, must also be a multiple of 9. Got that.Now, n has 1996 digits. That's a pretty large number! The maximum possible sum of its digits would be if all digits were 9. So, the maximum p could be is 1996 multiplied by 9. Let me calculate that: 1996 * 9. Hmm, 2000 * 9 is 18,000, so subtracting 4*9=36, that gives 18,000 - 36 = 17,964. So, p is at most 17,964.But p is the sum of the digits of n, which is a 1996-digit number. So, p is somewhere between 1 (if n was 100...000) and 17,964. But since n is a multiple of 9, p must be a multiple of 9. So, p is in the range 9 to 17,964, stepping by 9 each time.Next, q is the sum of the digits of p. So, let's think about what p could be. Since p is at most 17,964, which is a 5-digit number, the maximum sum of its digits would be 9+9+9+9+9=45. So, q is at most 45. But since p is a multiple of 9, q must also be a multiple of 9 because the sum of digits of a multiple of 9 is also a multiple of 9. So, q is in the range 9 to 45, stepping by 9 each time.Then, r is the sum of the digits of q. Since q is at most 45, which is a two-digit number, the maximum sum of its digits is 4+5=9. Wait, so r is at most 9. But since q is a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits, which is r, must also be a multiple of 9. The only single-digit multiple of 9 is 9 itself. So, r must be 9.Wait, let me verify that. If q is 9, then r is 9. If q is 18, then r is 1+8=9. If q is 27, then r is 2+7=9. Similarly, q=36 gives r=3+6=9, and q=45 gives r=4+5=9. So, regardless of what q is, as long as q is a multiple of 9, r will be 9. Therefore, r must be 9.But just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me recap:1. n is a 1996-digit multiple of 9, so p (sum of digits of n) is a multiple of 9.2. p is at most 17,964, so q (sum of digits of p) is at most 45, and is a multiple of 9.3. q is between 9 and 45, so r (sum of digits of q) is 9, since all multiples of 9 in that range have digit sums of 9.Therefore, r must be 9.**Final Answer**The value of ( r ) is boxed{9}."},{"question":"Find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 14 ) under the conditions ( x_1 leq 8 ), ( x_2 leq 8 ), and ( x_3 leq 8 ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 14 ) with the conditions that each ( x_i ) is less than or equal to 8. Hmm, alright. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that without any restrictions, the number of non-negative integer solutions to an equation like ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = n ) is given by the combination formula ( C(n + k - 1, k - 1) ), where ( k ) is the number of variables. In this case, ( k = 3 ), so the total number of solutions without any restrictions would be ( C(14 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(16, 2) ). Let me calculate that: ( C(16, 2) = frac{16 times 15}{2} = 120 ). So, there are 120 solutions without any restrictions.But now, I have the constraints that each ( x_i leq 8 ). So, I need to subtract the cases where any of the ( x_i ) is greater than 8. This sounds like a problem where the inclusion-exclusion principle would be useful. Let me recall how that works.The inclusion-exclusion principle helps in counting the number of elements in a union of sets by including and excluding the intersections appropriately. In this context, the sets would be the solutions where ( x_1 > 8 ), ( x_2 > 8 ), or ( x_3 > 8 ). So, I need to calculate the number of solutions where at least one variable exceeds 8 and subtract that from the total.Let me denote:- ( A ) as the set of solutions where ( x_1 > 8 ),- ( B ) as the set where ( x_2 > 8 ),- ( C ) as the set where ( x_3 > 8 ).Then, the number of solutions we want is ( |A cup B cup C| ). According to inclusion-exclusion, this is equal to ( |A| + |B| + |C| - |A cap B| - |A cap C| - |B cap C| + |A cap B cap C| ).So, first, let me compute ( |A| ). If ( x_1 > 8 ), let me set ( x_1' = x_1 - 9 ), so that ( x_1' geq 0 ). Then, the equation becomes ( x_1' + 9 + x_2 + x_3 = 14 ), which simplifies to ( x_1' + x_2 + x_3 = 5 ). The number of non-negative integer solutions to this is ( C(5 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(7, 2) = 21 ). Similarly, ( |B| ) and ( |C| ) are also 21 each because the problem is symmetric for all three variables.So, ( |A| + |B| + |C| = 21 + 21 + 21 = 63 ).Next, I need to compute ( |A cap B| ), which is the number of solutions where both ( x_1 > 8 ) and ( x_2 > 8 ). Let me set ( x_1' = x_1 - 9 ) and ( x_2' = x_2 - 9 ). Then, the equation becomes ( x_1' + 9 + x_2' + 9 + x_3 = 14 ), which simplifies to ( x_1' + x_2' + x_3 = -4 ). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum can't be negative. So, there are no solutions where both ( x_1 > 8 ) and ( x_2 > 8 ). Therefore, ( |A cap B| = 0 ). Similarly, ( |A cap C| ) and ( |B cap C| ) are also 0 because subtracting 9 from two variables would make the remaining sum negative, which isn't possible.Finally, ( |A cap B cap C| ) is the number of solutions where all three variables exceed 8. Let me set ( x_1' = x_1 - 9 ), ( x_2' = x_2 - 9 ), and ( x_3' = x_3 - 9 ). Then, the equation becomes ( x_1' + 9 + x_2' + 9 + x_3' + 9 = 14 ), which simplifies to ( x_1' + x_2' + x_3' = 14 - 27 = -13 ). Again, this is impossible, so ( |A cap B cap C| = 0 ).Putting it all together, the number of solutions where at least one variable exceeds 8 is ( 63 - 0 + 0 = 63 ). Therefore, the number of valid solutions is the total number of solutions without restrictions minus the invalid ones: ( 120 - 63 = 57 ).Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 57 seems a bit low. Let me recount.Total solutions: ( C(16, 2) = 120 ). Correct.Number of solutions where ( x_1 > 8 ): ( C(5 + 2, 2) = C(7, 2) = 21 ). Similarly for ( x_2 ) and ( x_3 ). So, 21 each, totaling 63. Correct.Now, intersections: ( |A cap B| ). If both ( x_1 > 8 ) and ( x_2 > 8 ), then ( x_1 + x_2 geq 18 ), but the total sum is 14, which is impossible. So, indeed, ( |A cap B| = 0 ). Same for the other intersections. So, subtracting 0.And the triple intersection is also 0. So, inclusion-exclusion gives 63 invalid solutions. So, 120 - 63 = 57.Hmm, but let me think differently. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of invalid solutions.Wait, another way to approach this is to use generating functions. The generating function for each variable ( x_i ) is ( 1 + x + x^2 + dots + x^8 ). So, the generating function for the equation is ( (1 + x + x^2 + dots + x^8)^3 ). We need the coefficient of ( x^{14} ) in this expansion.Alternatively, since ( 1 + x + dots + x^8 = frac{1 - x^9}{1 - x} ), so the generating function becomes ( left( frac{1 - x^9}{1 - x} right)^3 = (1 - x^9)^3 times (1 - x)^{-3} ).Expanding this, we can write it as ( (1 - 3x^9 + 3x^{18} - x^{27}) times sum_{n=0}^{infty} C(n + 2, 2) x^n ).So, the coefficient of ( x^{14} ) is ( C(14 + 2, 2) - 3C(14 - 9 + 2, 2) ). Because higher terms like ( x^{18} ) and ( x^{27} ) would contribute to higher exponents beyond 14, so they can be ignored.Calculating that:First term: ( C(16, 2) = 120 ).Second term: ( -3 times C(14 - 9 + 2, 2) = -3 times C(7, 2) = -3 times 21 = -63 ).So, total coefficient is ( 120 - 63 = 57 ). So, same result as before. So, seems correct.Wait, but another way to think about it is stars and bars with inclusion-exclusion. So, I think my initial approach was correct.But just to be thorough, let me consider another method: directly counting the number of solutions where each ( x_i leq 8 ).Alternatively, I can model this as placing 14 indistinct balls into 3 distinct boxes, each box holding at most 8 balls.The formula for this is ( C(n - 1, k - 1) - C(k, 1)C(n - m - 1, k - 1) + C(k, 2)C(n - 2m - 1, k - 1) - dots ), but in this case, since ( 3m = 24 > 14 ), the higher terms vanish.Wait, actually, the general formula is:Number of solutions = ( sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i C(k, i) C(n - i(m + 1) - 1, k - 1) ).But in our case, ( m = 8 ), ( k = 3 ), ( n = 14 ).So, plugging in:Number of solutions = ( C(14 - 1, 3 - 1) - C(3, 1)C(14 - 9 - 1, 3 - 1) + C(3, 2)C(14 - 18 - 1, 3 - 1) - C(3, 3)C(14 - 27 - 1, 3 - 1) ).Calculating each term:First term: ( C(13, 2) = 78 ).Second term: ( -3 times C(4, 2) = -3 times 6 = -18 ).Third term: ( 3 times C(-5, 2) ). Wait, ( C(-5, 2) ) is zero because you can't choose 2 items from -5. So, this term is 0.Fourth term: ( -1 times C(-14, 2) ). Similarly, this is zero.So, total number of solutions is ( 78 - 18 + 0 - 0 = 60 ). Wait, that's different from the previous result of 57. Hmm, now I'm confused.Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check the formula again.The inclusion-exclusion formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions with each ( x_i leq m ) is:( sum_{i=0}^{lfloor n/(m+1) rfloor} (-1)^i C(k, i) C(n - i(m + 1) - 1, k - 1) ).In our case, ( m = 8 ), ( m + 1 = 9 ), ( n = 14 ), ( k = 3 ).So, ( lfloor 14 / 9 rfloor = 1 ). So, the sum is from ( i = 0 ) to ( i = 1 ).So, the formula becomes:( C(14 - 1, 3 - 1) - C(3, 1)C(14 - 9 - 1, 3 - 1) ).Which is:( C(13, 2) - 3C(4, 2) = 78 - 3 times 6 = 78 - 18 = 60 ).But earlier, using generating functions, I got 57. Hmm, so which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the generating function approach. Let me check that again.The generating function is ( (1 + x + x^2 + dots + x^8)^3 ). So, the coefficient of ( x^{14} ) is the number of solutions. Alternatively, it's equal to the coefficient of ( x^{14} ) in ( (1 - x^9)^3 times (1 - x)^{-3} ).Expanding ( (1 - x^9)^3 ) gives ( 1 - 3x^9 + 3x^{18} - x^{27} ).Multiplying by ( (1 - x)^{-3} ), which is ( sum_{n=0}^{infty} C(n + 2, 2) x^n ).So, the coefficient of ( x^{14} ) is:( C(14 + 2, 2) - 3C(14 - 9 + 2, 2) + 3C(14 - 18 + 2, 2) - C(14 - 27 + 2, 2) ).Calculating each term:First term: ( C(16, 2) = 120 ).Second term: ( -3C(7, 2) = -3 times 21 = -63 ).Third term: ( 3C(-2, 2) ). Since ( C(-2, 2) = 0 ), this term is 0.Fourth term: ( -C(-11, 2) = 0 ).So, total coefficient is ( 120 - 63 = 57 ).But according to the inclusion-exclusion formula, it's 60. So, now I have conflicting results.Wait, maybe the inclusion-exclusion formula I used earlier was incorrect. Let me check the formula again.Wait, actually, the formula I used earlier was for the number of solutions where each ( x_i leq m ), but I think I might have misapplied it.Wait, the standard inclusion-exclusion formula for this problem is:Number of solutions = ( sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i C(k, i) C(n - i(m + 1) - 1, k - 1) ).But in our case, ( k = 3 ), ( m = 8 ), ( n = 14 ).So, the sum is from ( i = 0 ) to ( i = lfloor (n)/(m + 1) rfloor ). Here, ( lfloor 14/9 rfloor = 1 ). So, we have two terms: ( i = 0 ) and ( i = 1 ).So, first term: ( (-1)^0 C(3, 0) C(14 - 0 - 1, 3 - 1) = 1 times C(13, 2) = 78 ).Second term: ( (-1)^1 C(3, 1) C(14 - 9 - 1, 3 - 1) = -3 times C(4, 2) = -3 times 6 = -18 ).So, total is ( 78 - 18 = 60 ).But according to generating functions, it's 57. Hmm, so which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the generating function approach. Let me think again.Wait, in the generating function, when I subtract ( 3x^9 ), that corresponds to subtracting the cases where each variable exceeds 8. But in inclusion-exclusion, we subtract the cases where each variable exceeds 8, but also need to add back the cases where two variables exceed 8, but in our problem, that's impossible because ( 9 + 9 = 18 > 14 ). So, in inclusion-exclusion, those terms are zero. So, in generating functions, we have:( (1 - x^9)^3 times (1 - x)^{-3} ).So, the coefficient of ( x^{14} ) is ( C(16, 2) - 3C(7, 2) = 120 - 63 = 57 ).But according to the inclusion-exclusion formula, it's 60. So, which is correct?Wait, let me compute manually. Let's think about how many solutions there are.Total solutions without restriction: 120.Number of solutions where ( x_1 > 8 ): 21.Similarly, ( x_2 ) and ( x_3 ): 21 each.But when we subtract 21*3=63, we might be overcounting because some solutions might have two variables exceeding 8, but in reality, as we saw, it's impossible because 9+9=18 >14.Therefore, inclusion-exclusion tells us that the number of solutions with at least one variable exceeding 8 is exactly 63, so the number of valid solutions is 120 - 63 = 57.But according to the inclusion-exclusion formula, it's 60. So, which is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion formula. Let me check the formula again.Wait, the formula is:Number of solutions = ( sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i C(k, i) C(n - i(m + 1) - 1, k - 1) ).But in our case, ( n = 14 ), ( m = 8 ), ( k = 3 ).So, the sum is from ( i = 0 ) to ( i = 1 ).First term: ( C(14 - 0 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(13, 2) = 78 ).Second term: ( -C(3, 1)C(14 - 9 - 1, 3 - 1) = -3C(4, 2) = -18 ).So, total is 78 - 18 = 60.But according to generating functions and inclusion-exclusion principle, it's 57.Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check the formula again.I think the formula is actually:Number of solutions = ( sum_{i=0}^{lfloor (n - k)/m rfloor} (-1)^i C(k, i) C(n - i(m + 1) - 1, k - 1) ).Wait, no, that might not be correct.Wait, actually, the inclusion-exclusion formula for this problem is:Number of solutions = ( sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i C(k, i) C(n - i(m + 1) + k - 1, k - 1) ).Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. Let me think.In the standard stars and bars problem with upper bounds, the formula is:Number of solutions = ( sum_{i=0}^{lfloor (n - k)/m rfloor} (-1)^i C(k, i) C(n - i(m + 1) - 1, k - 1) ).But in our case, ( n = 14 ), ( k = 3 ), ( m = 8 ).So, ( lfloor (14 - 3)/8 rfloor = lfloor 11/8 rfloor = 1 ).So, the sum is from ( i = 0 ) to ( i = 1 ).First term: ( (-1)^0 C(3, 0) C(14 - 0 - 1, 3 - 1) = 1 times C(13, 2) = 78 ).Second term: ( (-1)^1 C(3, 1) C(14 - 9 - 1, 3 - 1) = -3 times C(4, 2) = -18 ).So, total is 78 - 18 = 60.But according to the generating function and the inclusion-exclusion principle, it's 57.Wait, maybe the formula is incorrect because when we subtract the cases where ( x_i > 8 ), we have to make sure that the remaining sum is non-negative.Wait, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, when we subtract ( C(3, 1)C(14 - 9 - 1, 3 - 1) ), we are subtracting the cases where one variable is at least 9, but the remaining sum is 5, which is non-negative. So, that's correct.But according to the generating function, the coefficient is 57, which is 120 - 63 = 57.Wait, so why is there a discrepancy?Wait, maybe the formula is not applicable here because when ( n - i(m + 1) ) becomes negative, the term is zero. So, in our case, for ( i = 1 ), ( n - i(m + 1) = 14 - 9 = 5 ), which is positive, so we include it.But for ( i = 2 ), ( n - 2(m + 1) = 14 - 18 = -4 ), which is negative, so we don't include it.Similarly, for ( i = 3 ), it's even more negative.So, according to the formula, it's 78 - 18 = 60.But according to generating functions, it's 57.Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect because when we subtract the cases where one variable is greater than 8, we have to consider that in the inclusion-exclusion, but in reality, when we subtract 3*21=63, we get 120 - 63=57.But according to the formula, it's 60.Wait, I think I need to resolve this discrepancy.Wait, let me compute manually for a smaller case to see which is correct.Suppose n=9, k=3, m=8.Total solutions without restriction: C(9 + 3 -1, 3 -1)=C(11,2)=55.Number of solutions where x1>8: set x1'=x1-9, then x1' +x2 +x3=0, which has 1 solution.Similarly, x2>8 and x3>8 each have 1 solution.So, inclusion-exclusion: 3*1 - 0 + 0=3.So, number of valid solutions=55 -3=52.Using the formula:Number of solutions= C(9 -1,3 -1) - C(3,1)C(9 -9 -1,3 -1)=C(8,2)-3*C(-1,2)=28 -0=28.But that's not correct because we know it's 52.Wait, so the formula is wrong.Wait, so perhaps the formula is not applicable here.Wait, so maybe the correct approach is the inclusion-exclusion principle as I initially did, which gave 57.But why does the formula give 60?Wait, perhaps the formula is for a different problem.Wait, I think the formula is for the number of solutions where each variable is at least m+1, but that's not our case.Wait, no, the formula is for the number of solutions where each variable is at most m.Wait, but in our case, when n=14, k=3, m=8, the formula gives 60, but the inclusion-exclusion gives 57.But in the smaller case, n=9, k=3, m=8, the formula gives 28, but the correct answer is 52.So, clearly, the formula is incorrect.Therefore, I think the correct approach is the inclusion-exclusion principle as I initially did, which gave 57.So, the number of solutions is 57.But to be thorough, let me compute it manually for a smaller case.Suppose n=10, k=3, m=8.Total solutions: C(12,2)=66.Number of solutions where x1>8: set x1'=x1-9, then x1' +x2 +x3=1, which has C(3,2)=3 solutions.Similarly for x2 and x3.So, inclusion-exclusion: 3*3 - 0 +0=9.So, number of valid solutions=66 -9=57.Wait, that's the same as our original problem.Wait, but in this case, n=10, k=3, m=8, the number of solutions is 57.But according to the formula:Number of solutions= C(10 -1,3 -1) - C(3,1)C(10 -9 -1,3 -1)=C(9,2)-3*C(0,2)=36 -0=36.Which is incorrect because the correct answer is 57.So, the formula is definitely wrong.Therefore, the correct approach is inclusion-exclusion as I did initially, which gave 57.So, the answer is 57.But wait, in the case of n=10, k=3, m=8, the number of valid solutions is 57, which is the same as our original problem.But in the original problem, n=14, k=3, m=8, the number of valid solutions is also 57.Wait, that seems odd.Wait, let me compute n=14, k=3, m=8.Total solutions: 120.Number of solutions where x1>8: set x1'=x1-9, then x1' +x2 +x3=5, which has C(5 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(7,2)=21.Similarly for x2 and x3.So, inclusion-exclusion: 3*21=63.Number of solutions where two variables exceed 8: impossible, as 9+9=18>14.So, subtract 63 from 120: 120 -63=57.Yes, that's correct.So, the answer is 57.Therefore, despite the confusion with the formula, the correct answer is 57.**Final Answer**The number of non-negative integer solutions is boxed{57}."},{"question":"For  a>0 , let  l  be the line created by rotating the tangent line to parabola  y=x^{2} , which is tangent at point  A(a,a^{2}) , around  A  by  -frac{pi}{6} .\\rLet  B  be the other intersection of  l  and  y=x^{2} .

Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the problem is about the parabola y = x². We have a point A on this parabola, which is (a, a²) where a > 0. The first part is to find the equation of the line l, which is created by rotating the tangent line at point A by -π/6 around point A.Alright, so I need to find the tangent line at A first. The derivative of y = x² is y' = 2x, so at point A(a, a²), the slope of the tangent is 2a. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at A is:y - a² = 2a(x - a)Simplifying that, it becomes:y = 2a x - 2a² + a²y = 2a x - a²So that's the tangent line. Now, we need to rotate this tangent line around point A by -π/6. Rotating a line around a point changes its slope. The angle of rotation is -π/6, which is -30 degrees. So, the new slope will be the original slope plus the tangent of the rotation angle, but I need to be careful with the direction.Wait, actually, when you rotate a line by an angle θ, the new slope m' is given by:m' = (m + tanθ) / (1 - m tanθ)But since we're rotating the line around point A, the point A remains fixed, and the line just changes its slope. So, the original slope is m = 2a, and we're rotating it by -π/6, so θ = -π/6.Therefore, tanθ = tan(-π/6) = -1/√3.So, plugging into the formula:m' = (2a + (-1/√3)) / (1 - (2a)(-1/√3))= (2a - 1/√3) / (1 + 2a/√3)Let me compute that:Multiply numerator and denominator by √3 to rationalize:Numerator: √3*(2a) - √3*(1/√3) = 2a√3 - 1Denominator: √3*1 + √3*(2a/√3) = √3 + 2aSo, m' = (2a√3 - 1)/(√3 + 2a)Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe it can be simplified. Let me see:Let me factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: 2a√3 - 1Denominator: 2a + √3Hmm, not much to factor here. Maybe we can write it as:m' = (2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)Alternatively, perhaps we can rationalize or do something else, but maybe that's the simplest form.So, the slope of the rotated line l is m' = (2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3). Since we're rotating around point A, the line l passes through A(a, a²). Therefore, the equation of line l is:y - a² = [(2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)](x - a)So, that's the equation of line l. Let me write that as:y = [(2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)](x - a) + a²I think that's the answer for part (1). Let me double-check my steps.1. Found the tangent line at A: y = 2a x - a². Correct.2. Calculated the slope after rotation: used the formula for rotating a line by angle θ, which is m' = (m + tanθ)/(1 - m tanθ). Plugged in m = 2a and θ = -π/6, so tanθ = -1/√3. Correct.3. Computed m' as (2a - 1/√3)/(1 + 2a/√3). Then multiplied numerator and denominator by √3 to get (2a√3 - 1)/(√3 + 2a). Correct.4. Then wrote the equation of line l using point-slope form. Correct.So, I think that's solid.Moving on to part (2). We need to find S(a) and T(a), then compute the limit as a approaches infinity of T(a)/S(a).First, let's understand what S(a) and T(a) are.S(a) is the area bounded by OC, CA, and y = x². O is the origin, C is (a, 0), and A is (a, a²). So, the region is a sort of triangle-like shape but bounded by the parabola.Wait, OC is the line from O(0,0) to C(a,0), which is just the x-axis from 0 to a. CA is the line from C(a,0) to A(a, a²), which is a vertical line at x = a from y=0 to y=a². And the parabola y = x². So, the region bounded by these three is the area under the parabola from x=0 to x=a, minus the area of the triangle or something?Wait, no. Let me visualize it.From O(0,0) to C(a,0) is along the x-axis. From C(a,0) to A(a, a²) is vertical. Then from A(a, a²) back to O(0,0) along the parabola y = x². So, the region is bounded by the x-axis, the vertical line x=a, and the parabola.Therefore, S(a) is the area under the parabola from x=0 to x=a. Which is the integral from 0 to a of x² dx.Compute that:S(a) = ∫₀^a x² dx = [x³/3]₀^a = a³/3 - 0 = a³/3.Wait, but hold on, is that correct? Because the region is bounded by OC, CA, and the parabola. So, yes, it's the area under the parabola from 0 to a, which is indeed a³/3.Okay, so S(a) = a³/3.Now, T(a) is the area bounded by AB and y = x². So, AB is the line l we found earlier, which intersects the parabola at A and B. So, T(a) is the area between the parabola and the line AB from x = a to x = b, where B is (b, b²).So, first, we need to find the coordinates of point B, which is the other intersection of line l and the parabola y = x².We have the equation of line l: y = [(2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)](x - a) + a².We can set this equal to x² to find the intersection points.So, x² = [(2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)](x - a) + a².Let me denote m = (2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3) for simplicity.So, equation becomes:x² = m(x - a) + a²Bring all terms to one side:x² - m x + m a - a² = 0We know that x = a is a root because line l is tangent at A, but wait, no. Wait, actually, line l is not the tangent anymore; it's a different line obtained by rotating the tangent. So, does it intersect the parabola at two points, A and B?Yes, because it's a line intersecting a parabola, so it can intersect at two points. Since we rotated the tangent line, which was only touching at A, now it's a secant line intersecting at A and another point B.Therefore, the quadratic equation x² - m x + m a - a² = 0 has two roots: x = a and x = b.So, we can factor this quadratic as (x - a)(x - b) = 0.Expanding, we get x² - (a + b)x + a b = 0.Comparing with our equation x² - m x + (m a - a²) = 0.Therefore, coefficients must be equal:- Coefficient of x: -(a + b) = -m => a + b = m- Constant term: a b = m a - a²So, from the first equation: b = m - aFrom the second equation: a b = m a - a² => b = m - aWhich is consistent.Therefore, b = m - a.So, once we find m, we can find b.Given m = (2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)So, b = m - a = [(2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)] - aLet me compute that:First, write a as [a(2a + √3)]/(2a + √3)So,b = [2a√3 - 1 - a(2a + √3)] / (2a + √3)Compute numerator:2a√3 - 1 - 2a² - a√3 = (2a√3 - a√3) - 2a² - 1 = a√3 - 2a² - 1Therefore,b = (a√3 - 2a² - 1)/(2a + √3)Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe we can factor numerator:Let me write numerator as -2a² + a√3 - 1.Not sure if it factors nicely. Maybe we can factor out a negative sign:= -(2a² - a√3 + 1)But denominator is 2a + √3, which doesn't seem to factor into the numerator.Alternatively, perhaps we can perform polynomial division or something.Wait, maybe we can write numerator as:-2a² + a√3 - 1 = (-2a² - √3 a) + (a√3 + √3 * something). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps we can factor numerator as:Let me consider 2a² - a√3 + 1.Wait, discriminant is (√3)^2 - 4*2*1 = 3 - 8 = -5, which is negative, so it doesn't factor over real numbers. So, maybe we can't factor it.Therefore, perhaps we can leave b as (a√3 - 2a² - 1)/(2a + √3). Alternatively, factor numerator:Wait, numerator is -2a² + a√3 - 1.Let me factor out a negative sign:= - (2a² - a√3 + 1)So, b = - (2a² - a√3 + 1)/(2a + √3)Alternatively, perhaps we can perform division:Divide numerator -2a² + a√3 - 1 by denominator 2a + √3.Let me set it up:Divide -2a² + a√3 - 1 by 2a + √3.First term: (-2a²)/(2a) = -aMultiply divisor by -a: (-a)(2a + √3) = -2a² - a√3Subtract this from the dividend:(-2a² + a√3 - 1) - (-2a² - a√3) = 0 + 2a√3 - 1So, remainder is 2a√3 - 1.Therefore,b = -a + (2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)Wait, but that's the same as m, right? Because m = (2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)So, b = -a + mBut m = (2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)So, b = -a + (2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)Hmm, okay, so that's another way to write it.But perhaps it's not necessary. Maybe we can just keep b as (a√3 - 2a² - 1)/(2a + √3). It might be useful later.So, now, to find T(a), which is the area between AB and the parabola y = x². So, it's the integral from x = a to x = b of [parabola - line] dx, but we need to check which function is on top.Wait, since we rotated the tangent line downward by π/6, the line l is now below the original tangent line, so it might intersect the parabola at another point B which is to the left of A.Wait, let's think about the geometry.Original tangent at A(a, a²) has a positive slope 2a. Rotating it by -π/6 (clockwise) would make the slope less steep, so it becomes a line with a smaller positive slope. Therefore, the line l would intersect the parabola again at some point B to the left of A.Therefore, the region bounded by AB and the parabola is between x = b and x = a, where b < a.Therefore, T(a) is the integral from x = b to x = a of [parabola - line] dx.So, T(a) = ∫₆^a [x² - y_l(x)] dx, where y_l(x) is the equation of line l.So, first, let me write y_l(x):y_l(x) = [(2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)](x - a) + a²So, T(a) = ∫₆^a [x² - ((2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3))(x - a) - a²] dxLet me simplify the integrand:Let me denote m = (2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3), so:Integrand = x² - m(x - a) - a²= x² - m x + m a - a²So, T(a) = ∫₆^a (x² - m x + m a - a²) dxBut we already know that x = a and x = b are roots of x² - m x + m a - a² = 0, so the integrand is (x - a)(x - b). Therefore, T(a) is the integral from b to a of (x - a)(x - b) dx.But since b < a, (x - a) is negative and (x - b) is positive in [b, a], so the integrand is negative. But since area is positive, we can take the absolute value, so T(a) = ∫₆^a |(x - a)(x - b)| dx = ∫₆^a (a - x)(x - b) dx.Alternatively, since (x - a)(x - b) = x² - (a + b)x + a b, which is the same as the quadratic we had earlier.But maybe it's better to compute the integral as is.So, let's compute T(a):T(a) = ∫₆^a (x² - m x + m a - a²) dxCompute the antiderivative:= [x³/3 - (m/2)x² + (m a - a²)x] evaluated from b to aAt x = a:= (a³/3 - (m/2)a² + (m a - a²)a)= a³/3 - (m/2)a² + m a² - a³= a³/3 - (m/2)a² + m a² - a³= (-2a³/3) + (m/2)a²At x = b:= (b³/3 - (m/2)b² + (m a - a²)b)So, T(a) = [(-2a³/3) + (m/2)a²] - [b³/3 - (m/2)b² + (m a - a²)b]This seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.Alternatively, since we know that the integrand is (x - a)(x - b), and we can express the integral in terms of (a - b)^3 or something.Wait, let me think. The integral of (x - a)(x - b) from b to a is equal to the integral from b to a of (x - a)(x - b) dx.Let me make a substitution: let t = x - b, then when x = b, t = 0; when x = a, t = a - b.But maybe that complicates things.Alternatively, note that (x - a)(x - b) = x² - (a + b)x + a b.So, integrating term by term:∫ (x² - (a + b)x + a b) dx = (x³/3 - (a + b)x²/2 + a b x) evaluated from b to a.So, plugging in a:= (a³/3 - (a + b)a²/2 + a b a)= a³/3 - (a³ + a² b)/2 + a² b= a³/3 - a³/2 - (a² b)/2 + a² b= (-a³/6) + (a² b)/2Plugging in b:= (b³/3 - (a + b)b²/2 + a b²)= b³/3 - (a b² + b³)/2 + a b²= b³/3 - a b²/2 - b³/2 + a b²= (-b³/6) + (a b²)/2Therefore, T(a) = [(-a³/6) + (a² b)/2] - [(-b³/6) + (a b²)/2]Simplify:= (-a³/6 + (a² b)/2) - (-b³/6 + (a b²)/2)= -a³/6 + (a² b)/2 + b³/6 - (a b²)/2Factor terms:= (-a³ + 3 a² b - 3 a b² + b³)/6Notice that numerator is -(a³ - 3 a² b + 3 a b² - b³) = -(a - b)^3Therefore,T(a) = [ - (a - b)^3 ] / 6But since T(a) is an area, it should be positive. So, T(a) = (a - b)^3 / 6Because (a - b) is positive since a > b.So, T(a) = (a - b)^3 / 6That's a nice result. So, now, we need to compute (a - b)^3 / 6.We have b = (a√3 - 2a² - 1)/(2a + √3)So, a - b = a - [ (a√3 - 2a² - 1)/(2a + √3) ]Compute that:= [a(2a + √3) - (a√3 - 2a² - 1)] / (2a + √3)Compute numerator:= 2a² + a√3 - a√3 + 2a² + 1= (2a² + 2a²) + (a√3 - a√3) + 1= 4a² + 0 + 1= 4a² + 1Therefore, a - b = (4a² + 1)/(2a + √3)So, T(a) = (a - b)^3 / 6 = [ (4a² + 1)/(2a + √3) ]³ / 6So, T(a) = (4a² + 1)^3 / [6 (2a + √3)^3 ]Now, S(a) is a³ / 3.So, the ratio T(a)/S(a) is:[ (4a² + 1)^3 / (6 (2a + √3)^3 ) ] / (a³ / 3 )= [ (4a² + 1)^3 / (6 (2a + √3)^3 ) ] * [ 3 / a³ ]= [ (4a² + 1)^3 * 3 ] / [ 6 (2a + √3)^3 a³ ]= [ (4a² + 1)^3 ] / [ 2 (2a + √3)^3 a³ ]So, T(a)/S(a) = (4a² + 1)^3 / [ 2 (2a + √3)^3 a³ ]Now, we need to compute the limit as a approaches infinity of this expression.Let me write it as:lim_{a→∞} [ (4a² + 1)^3 / (2 (2a + √3)^3 a³) ]First, let's analyze the numerator and denominator.Numerator: (4a² + 1)^3Denominator: 2 (2a + √3)^3 a³Let me factor out the highest power of a from numerator and denominator.Numerator: (4a² + 1)^3 = [4a²(1 + 1/(4a²))]^3 = (4a²)^3 [1 + 1/(4a²)]^3 = 64a^6 [1 + 3/(4a²) + 3/(16a^4) + 1/(64a^6)]Denominator: 2 (2a + √3)^3 a³ = 2 [2a(1 + √3/(2a))]^3 a³ = 2*(8a³)(1 + 3√3/(4a) + 3*(3)/(16a²) + (√3)^3/(8a³)) * a³Wait, let me compute denominator step by step.First, (2a + √3)^3:= (2a)^3 + 3*(2a)^2*(√3) + 3*(2a)*(√3)^2 + (√3)^3= 8a³ + 3*4a²*√3 + 3*2a*3 + 3√3= 8a³ + 12√3 a² + 18a + 3√3But perhaps it's better to factor out 2a:(2a + √3)^3 = [2a(1 + √3/(2a))]^3 = 8a³(1 + √3/(2a))^3So, denominator:2*(8a³)(1 + √3/(2a))^3 * a³ = 16a^6 (1 + √3/(2a))^3So, denominator is 16a^6 [1 + 3*(√3)/(2a) + 3*(3)/(4a²) + (√3)^3/(8a³)]Wait, no, more accurately, (1 + x)^3 = 1 + 3x + 3x² + x³, where x = √3/(2a)So,(1 + √3/(2a))^3 = 1 + 3*(√3)/(2a) + 3*(3)/(4a²) + (√3)^3/(8a³)= 1 + (3√3)/(2a) + 9/(4a²) + (3√3)/(8a³)Therefore, denominator:16a^6 [1 + (3√3)/(2a) + 9/(4a²) + (3√3)/(8a³)]So, putting it all together:T(a)/S(a) = [64a^6 (1 + 3/(4a²) + ... ) ] / [16a^6 (1 + (3√3)/(2a) + ... ) ]Simplify constants:64 / 16 = 4So,= 4 [1 + 3/(4a²) + ... ] / [1 + (3√3)/(2a) + ... ]As a approaches infinity, the terms with 1/a, 1/a², etc., go to zero. Therefore, the limit is:4 * [1 + 0 + ... ] / [1 + 0 + ... ] = 4Wait, but hold on, let me make sure.Wait, in the numerator, after factoring out 64a^6, the remaining term is [1 + 3/(4a²) + ...], which tends to 1 as a→∞.In the denominator, after factoring out 16a^6, the remaining term is [1 + (3√3)/(2a) + ...], which also tends to 1 as a→∞.Therefore, the limit is 64 / 16 = 4.Wait, but 64 / 16 is 4, yes.But wait, let me double-check my factoring.Numerator: (4a² + 1)^3 = (4a²)^3*(1 + 1/(4a²))^3 = 64a^6*(1 + 3/(4a²) + 3/(16a^4) + 1/(64a^6))Denominator: 2*(2a + √3)^3*a³ = 2*(8a³*(1 + √3/(2a))^3)*a³ = 16a^6*(1 + 3√3/(2a) + 9/(4a²) + 3√3/(8a³))So, when we take the ratio:[64a^6*(1 + 3/(4a²) + ...)] / [16a^6*(1 + 3√3/(2a) + ...)] = (64/16)*(1 + ...)/(1 + ...) = 4*(1 + 0)/(1 + 0) = 4.Therefore, the limit is 4.Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the denominator.Wait, denominator is 2*(2a + √3)^3*a³.(2a + √3)^3 = 8a³ + 12√3 a² + 18a + 3√3.Multiply by a³: 8a^6 + 12√3 a^5 + 18a^4 + 3√3 a³.Multiply by 2: 16a^6 + 24√3 a^5 + 36a^4 + 6√3 a³.So, denominator is 16a^6 + 24√3 a^5 + 36a^4 + 6√3 a³.Numerator is (4a² + 1)^3 = 64a^6 + 48a^4 + 12a² + 1.So, T(a)/S(a) = [64a^6 + 48a^4 + 12a² + 1] / [16a^6 + 24√3 a^5 + 36a^4 + 6√3 a³] * (1/2) ?Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, earlier steps had T(a)/S(a) = (4a² + 1)^3 / [2 (2a + √3)^3 a³ ]But when I expanded, I had numerator as 64a^6*(1 + ...) and denominator as 16a^6*(1 + ...). So, 64/16 = 4.But let me think, when a is very large, the dominant terms are the highest powers.So, numerator ~ (4a²)^3 = 64a^6Denominator ~ 2*(2a)^3*a³ = 2*8a³*a³ = 16a^6So, ratio ~ 64a^6 / 16a^6 = 4.Therefore, the limit is 4.Wait, but earlier, when I did the expansion, I thought the limit was 4, but in the initial step, when I computed T(a)/S(a) = (a - b)^3 / 6 divided by (a³ / 3), which is (a - b)^3 / (2 a³). Then, since a - b ~ (4a²)/(2a) = 2a, so (a - b)^3 ~ (2a)^3 = 8a³, so 8a³ / (2a³) = 4. So, same result.Therefore, the limit is 4.Wait, but let me confirm with the exact expression:T(a)/S(a) = (4a² + 1)^3 / [2 (2a + √3)^3 a³ ]Divide numerator and denominator by a^6:= [ (4 + 1/a²)^3 / (2 (2 + √3/a)^3 ) ] * (1/a³) * a^6Wait, no, better:= [ (4a² + 1)^3 / a^6 ] / [2 (2a + √3)^3 / a^3 ]= [ (4 + 1/a²)^3 ] / [2 (2 + √3/a)^3 ]As a→∞, 1/a²→0 and √3/a→0, so:= (4)^3 / [2*(2)^3] = 64 / (2*8) = 64 / 16 = 4.Yes, that's consistent.Therefore, the limit is 4.So, summarizing:(1) The equation of line l is y = [(2a√3 - 1)/(2a + √3)](x - a) + a².(2) The limit of T(a)/S(a) as a approaches infinity is 4.**Final Answer**(1) The equation of line ( l ) is (boxed{y = dfrac{2asqrt{3} - 1}{2a + sqrt{3}}(x - a) + a^2}).(2) The limit is (boxed{4})."},{"question":"Toward the end of a game of Fish, the 2 through 7 of spades, inclusive, remain in the hands of three distinguishable players: DBR, RB, and DB, such that each player has at least one card. If it is known that DBR either has more than one card or has an even-numbered spade, or both, in how many ways can the players' hands be distributed?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about distributing cards in a game of Fish. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. We have the 2 through 7 of spades, which are six cards in total. These are distributed among three players: DBR, RB, and DB. Each player must have at least one card. Additionally, there's a condition: DBR either has more than one card or has an even-numbered spade, or both. I need to find the number of ways the players' hands can be distributed under these conditions.First, let me break down the problem. Without any conditions, the number of ways to distribute six distinct cards among three distinguishable players, each getting at least one card, is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem. The formula for that is 3! * S(6,3), where S(6,3) is the Stirling numbers of the second kind. But since the players are distinguishable and each card is unique, another way to think about it is that each card can go to any of the three players, so 3^6 total distributions. Then subtract the distributions where at least one player gets nothing. But wait, actually, since each player must have at least one card, it's the inclusion-exclusion principle:Total distributions = 3^6 - 3*2^6 + 3*1^6.Let me compute that:3^6 = 7292^6 = 64, so 3*64 = 1921^6 = 1, so 3*1 = 3So total distributions = 729 - 192 + 3 = 540.But that's without any conditions. Now, we have a condition on DBR: either DBR has more than one card or DBR has an even-numbered spade, or both. So, I need to count the number of distributions where DBR satisfies this condition.Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the total number of distributions without any restrictions (which is 540) and subtract the number of distributions where DBR has exactly one card and that card is odd-numbered. Because those would be the distributions that violate the given condition.Yes, that sounds like a plan. So, total valid distributions = total distributions - distributions where DBR has exactly one card and that card is odd.So, let me compute the number of distributions where DBR has exactly one card and that card is odd.First, how many odd-numbered spades are there? The cards are 2,3,4,5,6,7. So, the odd ones are 3,5,7. That's three cards.So, if DBR has exactly one card, and it's odd, then we have 3 choices for DBR's card. Then, the remaining 5 cards need to be distributed between RB and DB, with each of them getting at least one card. Because the original condition is that each player has at least one card, so even in this restricted case, RB and DB must each have at least one card.So, the number of ways to distribute the remaining 5 cards to RB and DB, each getting at least one card, is 2^5 - 2 = 30. Because each of the 5 cards can go to either RB or DB, so 2^5=32, minus the two cases where all go to RB or all go to DB.Therefore, the number of distributions where DBR has exactly one odd card is 3 * 30 = 90.Hence, the number of valid distributions is total distributions (540) minus 90, which is 450.Wait, hold on. Let me verify that.Total distributions: 540.Subtract the distributions where DBR has exactly one card and it's odd: 90.So, 540 - 90 = 450.Is that correct? Hmm.Alternatively, maybe I should think about it another way. Let me consider the condition: DBR has more than one card OR DBR has an even-numbered spade, or both.So, the complement of this condition is: DBR has exactly one card AND that card is odd.Which is exactly what I subtracted. So, yes, that seems correct.But just to make sure, let me think about another approach.Alternatively, I can compute the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card, plus the number where DBR has an even-numbered spade, minus the overlap where both happen.But that might be more complicated because of the overlap. So, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is more straightforward.But let me try it.First, compute the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card.Total distributions: 540.Number of distributions where DBR has exactly one card: ?To compute that, choose one card for DBR: 6 choices, then distribute the remaining 5 cards to RB and DB, each getting at least one. So, 6 * (2^5 - 2) = 6 * 30 = 180.So, the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card is 540 - 180 = 360.Next, compute the number of distributions where DBR has an even-numbered spade. The even-numbered spades are 2,4,6. So, three cards.So, DBR must have at least one of these. So, the number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade.To compute this, it's total distributions minus distributions where DBR has no even spades.Total distributions: 540.Number of distributions where DBR has no even spades: DBR can only have the odd spades: 3,5,7. So, 3 cards.So, the number of distributions where DBR has only odd spades is similar to the earlier problem. So, DBR can have any number of the 3 odd cards, but each player must have at least one card.Wait, no, actually, if DBR can have any subset of the 3 odd cards, but the rest must be distributed to RB and DB, each getting at least one card.Wait, actually, it's similar to the previous calculation.If DBR can have any number of the 3 odd cards, but the remaining 3 cards (the evens) must be distributed to RB and DB, each getting at least one card.Wait, no, hold on. If DBR has only odd spades, then the even spades must be distributed to RB and DB.But the total number of cards is 6: 3 odd and 3 even.If DBR has some subset of the 3 odd spades, then the remaining 3 even spades and the remaining odd spades (if any) are distributed to RB and DB, each getting at least one card.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, the number of distributions where DBR has no even spades is equal to the number of distributions where all even spades are given to RB and DB, and DBR gets only odd spades.So, the 3 even spades must be distributed between RB and DB, each getting at least one. The number of ways to distribute 3 distinct cards to RB and DB, each getting at least one, is 2^3 - 2 = 6.Then, the 3 odd spades can be distributed to DBR, RB, and DB, but DBR must get at least one card (since each player must have at least one card). Wait, no, actually, DBR can get any number of the odd spades, including all of them, as long as RB and DB get at least one card in total.Wait, no, hold on. The entire distribution must ensure that each player has at least one card. So, if DBR is getting some odd spades, and the even spades are being distributed to RB and DB, each of whom must have at least one card.So, the total number of distributions where DBR has no even spades is equal to:First, distribute the 3 even spades to RB and DB, each getting at least one. That's 6 ways.Then, distribute the 3 odd spades to DBR, RB, and DB, with DBR getting at least one card (since each player must have at least one). Wait, no, DBR can get any number of the odd spades, including zero, as long as overall, each player has at least one card. But since the even spades are already being distributed to RB and DB, each of them will have at least one card, regardless of what DBR gets.Therefore, for the odd spades, DBR can get any subset of the 3 odd spades, including all or none. But since the total distribution must have each player with at least one card, and RB and DB already have at least one card from the even spades, DBR can have any number of the odd spades, including zero.Wait, but DBR must have at least one card in total. So, if DBR gets zero odd spades, then DBR has zero cards, which violates the condition. Therefore, DBR must get at least one odd spade.Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the odd spades is equal to the number of subsets of the 3 odd spades that DBR can have, excluding the empty set, and the rest go to RB and DB.But wait, no. The odd spades can be distributed to DBR, RB, and DB, with DBR getting at least one, and RB and DB already getting at least one from the even spades.So, for the 3 odd spades, each can go to DBR, RB, or DB, but DBR must get at least one.So, the number of ways is 3^3 - 2^3 = 27 - 8 = 19? Wait, no.Wait, the number of ways to distribute 3 distinct objects into 3 distinct boxes with DBR getting at least one is 3^3 - 2^3 = 27 - 8 = 19. Because 3^3 is all possible distributions, and 2^3 is the distributions where DBR gets nothing.But wait, actually, in this case, RB and DB already have at least one card each from the even spades, so even if DBR gets all the odd spades, RB and DB still have at least one card. So, the only restriction is that DBR must get at least one card (from the odd spades). So, the number of ways is 3^3 - 2^3 = 19.Therefore, the total number of distributions where DBR has no even spades is 6 (ways to distribute even spades) multiplied by 19 (ways to distribute odd spades with DBR getting at least one). So, 6 * 19 = 114.Therefore, the number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade is total distributions (540) minus distributions where DBR has no even spades (114), which is 540 - 114 = 426.Wait, so earlier, I had 450 as the answer, but now I have 426. That's a discrepancy. Hmm.Wait, so which one is correct?Wait, in the first approach, I subtracted the number of distributions where DBR has exactly one card and it's odd, which was 90, from the total 540, getting 450.In the second approach, I computed the number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade as 426.But these two numbers should be equal, because the condition is \\"DBR has more than one card OR DBR has an even spade, or both.\\" So, the two approaches should give the same result.Wait, but 450 ≠ 426, so something is wrong.Wait, perhaps my second approach is incorrect.Let me check the second approach again.I said that the number of distributions where DBR has no even spades is 6 * 19 = 114.But wait, let's think about it.If DBR has no even spades, then all even spades must go to RB and DB, each getting at least one. So, the number of ways to distribute the 3 even spades to RB and DB, each getting at least one, is 2^3 - 2 = 6.Then, for the 3 odd spades, DBR must get at least one, because DBR can't have zero cards. So, the number of ways to distribute the 3 odd spades to DBR, RB, and DB, with DBR getting at least one, is 3^3 - 2^3 = 19.Therefore, total distributions where DBR has no even spades is 6 * 19 = 114.Therefore, the number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade is 540 - 114 = 426.But in the first approach, I subtracted the distributions where DBR has exactly one card and it's odd, which was 90, leading to 450.So, why the discrepancy?Wait, perhaps the two approaches are not equivalent.Wait, the first approach subtracts the distributions where DBR has exactly one card and it's odd. But the condition is DBR has more than one card OR DBR has an even spade, or both.So, the complement is DBR has exactly one card AND it's odd.Therefore, the number of valid distributions is total distributions minus the complement, which is 540 - 90 = 450.But in the second approach, I computed the number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade as 426, which is less than 450.So, perhaps the second approach is wrong.Wait, why?Because in the second approach, I considered all distributions where DBR has at least one even spade, regardless of how many cards DBR has. So, that includes distributions where DBR has one even spade and the rest are distributed to RB and DB.But the original condition is DBR has more than one card OR DBR has an even spade.So, actually, the two conditions are not the same. So, the first approach is correct because it directly subtracts the complement.Wait, but let me think again.The condition is: DBR has more than one card OR DBR has an even spade, or both.So, the complement is: DBR has exactly one card AND DBR has no even spades, i.e., DBR has exactly one odd spade.Therefore, the number of distributions where DBR has exactly one odd spade is 3 * (number of ways to distribute the remaining 5 cards to RB and DB, each getting at least one card).Which is 3 * (2^5 - 2) = 3 * 30 = 90.Therefore, the number of valid distributions is 540 - 90 = 450.So, the first approach is correct.But why did the second approach give a different answer?Because in the second approach, I considered all distributions where DBR has at least one even spade, regardless of the number of cards DBR has. So, that includes distributions where DBR has one even spade and the rest are distributed to RB and DB, which is a subset of the valid distributions.But the original condition is broader: it includes distributions where DBR has more than one card, regardless of whether they are even or odd, as well as distributions where DBR has an even spade, even if DBR has only one card.Wait, so actually, the condition is:DBR has more than one card OR DBR has at least one even spade.So, the complement is DBR has exactly one card AND DBR has no even spades, i.e., DBR has exactly one odd spade.Therefore, the number of valid distributions is 540 - 90 = 450.So, the first approach is correct.Therefore, the answer is 450.But wait, let me just confirm.Alternatively, let me compute the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card OR DBR has an even spade.Which is equal to (number of distributions where DBR has more than one card) + (number of distributions where DBR has an even spade) - (number of distributions where both happen).So, let's compute each term.First, number of distributions where DBR has more than one card: as computed earlier, 540 - 180 = 360.Second, number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade: 540 - 114 = 426.Third, number of distributions where both DBR has more than one card AND DBR has at least one even spade.So, we need to compute this overlap.Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the overlap as (number of distributions where DBR has more than one card) minus (number of distributions where DBR has more than one card and no even spades).So, number of distributions where DBR has more than one card and no even spades is equal to:DBR has more than one card, all of which are odd. So, DBR can have 2, 3, or all 3 odd spades.Number of ways:First, choose how many odd spades DBR gets: 2 or 3.For 2 odd spades: C(3,2) = 3. Then, distribute the remaining 1 odd spade and 3 even spades to RB and DB, each getting at least one card.Wait, no. If DBR has 2 odd spades, then the remaining 1 odd spade and 3 even spades must be distributed to RB and DB, each getting at least one card.So, total remaining cards: 4.Number of ways to distribute 4 distinct cards to RB and DB, each getting at least one: 2^4 - 2 = 14.But wait, the 4 cards are distinct, so it's 2^4 - 2 = 14.But wait, actually, the 4 cards are: 1 odd and 3 even. So, each is distinct.So, the number of ways is 14.Therefore, for DBR having 2 odd spades: 3 * 14 = 42.Similarly, for DBR having 3 odd spades: C(3,3)=1. Then, distribute the remaining 0 odd spades and 3 even spades to RB and DB, each getting at least one.So, the 3 even spades must be distributed to RB and DB, each getting at least one. That's 2^3 - 2 = 6.Therefore, for DBR having 3 odd spades: 1 * 6 = 6.Therefore, total number of distributions where DBR has more than one card and no even spades is 42 + 6 = 48.Therefore, the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card AND at least one even spade is equal to (number of distributions where DBR has more than one card) minus (number where DBR has more than one card and no even spades), which is 360 - 48 = 312.Therefore, going back to inclusion-exclusion:Number of distributions where DBR has more than one card OR DBR has at least one even spade = 360 + 426 - 312 = 474.Wait, but that's not matching with the first approach's 450.Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, perhaps my inclusion-exclusion is wrong.Wait, let me think again.The inclusion-exclusion principle states that |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|.Where A is the set of distributions where DBR has more than one card.B is the set of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade.So, |A| = 360|B| = 426|A ∩ B| = ?We need to compute |A ∩ B|, which is the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card AND at least one even spade.Alternatively, |A ∩ B| = |A| - |A ∩ not B|.Where |A ∩ not B| is the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card and no even spades, which we computed as 48.Therefore, |A ∩ B| = 360 - 48 = 312.Therefore, |A ∪ B| = 360 + 426 - 312 = 474.But this contradicts the first approach, which gave 450.So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the second approach is wrong because of an error in computing |B|.Earlier, I computed |B| as 540 - 114 = 426, where 114 is the number of distributions where DBR has no even spades.But let me re-examine that.Number of distributions where DBR has no even spades: 114.But is that correct?Wait, let's think about it.If DBR has no even spades, then all even spades must go to RB and DB.Number of ways to distribute 3 even spades to RB and DB, each getting at least one: 2^3 - 2 = 6.Then, the 3 odd spades can be distributed to DBR, RB, and DB, with DBR getting at least one card.Wait, but in this case, since DBR is getting only odd spades, and RB and DB are already getting at least one card each (from the even spades), DBR can get any number of the odd spades, including all or none.But wait, no, because each player must have at least one card. So, if DBR gets none of the odd spades, then DBR has zero cards, which is invalid. Therefore, DBR must get at least one odd spade.So, the number of ways to distribute the 3 odd spades to DBR, RB, and DB, with DBR getting at least one, is equal to:Total distributions of 3 odd spades to 3 players: 3^3 = 27.Minus the distributions where DBR gets none: 2^3 = 8.So, 27 - 8 = 19.Therefore, total number of distributions where DBR has no even spades is 6 * 19 = 114.Therefore, |B| = 540 - 114 = 426.So, that seems correct.Therefore, inclusion-exclusion gives |A ∪ B| = 360 + 426 - 312 = 474.But this contradicts the first approach, which gave 450.Wait, perhaps the first approach was wrong.Wait, in the first approach, I considered the complement as DBR having exactly one card and it's odd. So, 3 choices for the card, and then distributing the remaining 5 cards to RB and DB, each getting at least one: 2^5 - 2 = 30. So, 3 * 30 = 90.Therefore, total valid distributions = 540 - 90 = 450.But according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 474.So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the first approach is wrong because the complement is not just DBR having exactly one odd card, but also DBR having zero cards. But in our problem, each player must have at least one card, so DBR cannot have zero cards. Therefore, the only invalid distributions are those where DBR has exactly one card and it's odd.Therefore, the first approach is correct, giving 450.But why does inclusion-exclusion give a different answer?Wait, perhaps because in the inclusion-exclusion approach, I made a mistake in computing |A| or |B|.Wait, let me recompute |A|.|A| is the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card.Total distributions: 540.Number of distributions where DBR has exactly one card: ?To compute that, choose one card for DBR: 6 choices. Then, distribute the remaining 5 cards to RB and DB, each getting at least one card: 2^5 - 2 = 30.Therefore, number of distributions where DBR has exactly one card: 6 * 30 = 180.Therefore, |A| = 540 - 180 = 360.That seems correct.|B| is the number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade: 426.|A ∩ B| is the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card and at least one even spade: 312.Therefore, |A ∪ B| = 360 + 426 - 312 = 474.But according to the first approach, it's 450.So, there's a conflict.Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.Wait, the problem says: \\"DBR either has more than one card or has an even-numbered spade, or both.\\"So, it's the union of two sets: A (DBR has more than one card) and B (DBR has at least one even spade). So, the inclusion-exclusion should apply.But according to that, it's 474.But according to the complement approach, it's 450.So, which one is correct?Wait, let me think of a small example to test.Suppose we have 2 cards: 2 and 3. Players: A, B, C. Each must have at least one card.Compute the number of distributions where A has more than one card OR A has an even card, or both.Total distributions: 3^2 - 3*2 + 3 = 9 - 6 + 3 = 6.Wait, no, actually, for 2 cards, each card can go to A, B, or C, with each player getting at least one card.So, total distributions: 3^2 - 3*2^2 + 3*1^2 = 9 - 12 + 3 = 0. Wait, that can't be.Wait, no, for n=2, the number of onto functions from 2 elements to 3 elements is zero, because you can't have each of 3 players getting at least one card if you only have 2 cards.Wait, so in this case, the problem is invalid because it's impossible.Wait, maybe take n=3 cards, 3 players.Total distributions: 3^3 - 3*2^3 + 3*1^3 = 27 - 24 + 3 = 6.Wait, that's the number of onto functions, which is 6.Now, let's say the condition is A has more than one card OR A has an even card.Assuming the cards are 2,3,4.So, even cards: 2,4.Compute the number of distributions where A has more than one card OR A has an even card.Compute via complement: total distributions - distributions where A has exactly one card and it's odd.Odd cards: 3.So, number of distributions where A has exactly one odd card: 1 (only card 3) * number of ways to distribute the remaining 2 cards (2 and 4) to B and C, each getting at least one.Number of ways: 2^2 - 2 = 2.Therefore, total invalid distributions: 1 * 2 = 2.Therefore, valid distributions: 6 - 2 = 4.Now, compute via inclusion-exclusion.|A|: distributions where A has more than one card.Total distributions: 6.Number of distributions where A has exactly one card: C(3,1) * (2^2 - 2) = 3 * 2 = 6.Wait, but total distributions are 6, so |A| = 6 - 6 = 0? That can't be.Wait, no, in this case, for n=3, the number of distributions where A has exactly one card is 3 * (2^2 - 2) = 3 * 2 = 6. But total distributions are 6, so |A| = 6 - 6 = 0. That can't be right because A can have more than one card.Wait, this is getting confusing.Wait, perhaps the formula is different for small n.Wait, in the case of n=3, the number of distributions where A has exactly one card is 3 * (2^2 - 2) = 6, but total distributions are 6, so |A| = 0? That doesn't make sense.Wait, actually, in this case, all distributions have A having exactly one card, because there are 3 cards and 3 players, each getting exactly one card. So, in this case, each player has exactly one card. Therefore, the number of distributions where A has more than one card is zero.Therefore, |A| = 0.|B|: distributions where A has at least one even card.Even cards: 2,4.So, total distributions: 6.Number of distributions where A has no even cards: A must have only odd cards. The only odd card is 3. So, A has card 3, and the other two cards (2 and 4) are distributed to B and C, each getting one card. So, number of ways: 2! = 2.Therefore, |B| = 6 - 2 = 4.Therefore, |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B| = 0 + 4 - 0 = 4.Which matches the complement approach.Therefore, in this small case, both methods agree.But in the original problem, they don't. So, why?Wait, in the original problem, when I used the complement approach, I got 450, but inclusion-exclusion gave me 474.So, perhaps my inclusion-exclusion was wrong.Wait, let me check the numbers again.Total distributions: 540.Number of distributions where DBR has exactly one card: 6 * (2^5 - 2) = 6 * 30 = 180.Therefore, |A| = 540 - 180 = 360.Number of distributions where DBR has no even spades: 114.Therefore, |B| = 540 - 114 = 426.Number of distributions where DBR has more than one card and no even spades: 48.Therefore, |A ∩ B| = |A| - 48 = 360 - 48 = 312.Therefore, |A ∪ B| = 360 + 426 - 312 = 474.But according to the complement approach, it's 540 - 90 = 450.Wait, so which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the complement approach is wrong because the condition is not just DBR having exactly one odd card, but also, in the complement, DBR could have zero cards, but in our problem, each player must have at least one card, so DBR can't have zero.Therefore, the complement is only DBR having exactly one card and it's odd.Therefore, the first approach is correct, giving 450.But why does inclusion-exclusion give a different answer?Wait, perhaps because in the inclusion-exclusion approach, I made a mistake in computing |A ∩ B|.Wait, |A ∩ B| is the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card AND DBR has at least one even spade.But in the inclusion-exclusion, I computed |A ∩ B| as |A| - |A ∩ not B| = 360 - 48 = 312.But perhaps that's incorrect.Wait, actually, |A ∩ B| is equal to the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card and at least one even spade.Which can be computed as:Total distributions where DBR has more than one card: 360.Minus the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card and no even spades: 48.So, 360 - 48 = 312.Therefore, |A ∩ B| = 312.Therefore, |A ∪ B| = 360 + 426 - 312 = 474.But according to the complement approach, it's 450.Wait, so which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the complement approach is wrong because the condition is not just DBR having exactly one odd card, but also, in the complement, DBR could have more than one odd card, but that's not the case.Wait, no, the condition is DBR has more than one card OR DBR has an even spade.So, the complement is DBR has exactly one card AND it's odd.Therefore, the complement is only those distributions where DBR has exactly one odd card.Therefore, the number of such distributions is 3 * (2^5 - 2) = 90.Therefore, total valid distributions = 540 - 90 = 450.Therefore, the first approach is correct.But why does inclusion-exclusion give a different answer?Wait, perhaps because in the inclusion-exclusion approach, I made a mistake in computing |B|.Wait, let me re-examine |B|.|B| is the number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade.Which is equal to total distributions minus distributions where DBR has no even spades.Total distributions: 540.Distributions where DBR has no even spades: 114.Therefore, |B| = 540 - 114 = 426.But let me think about it differently.The number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade can also be computed as:For each even spade, compute the number of distributions where DBR has that spade, and then use inclusion-exclusion.But that might be more complicated.Alternatively, think of it as:Each even spade can be given to DBR or not, but DBR must have at least one.So, the number of ways is equal to the total number of distributions where DBR gets at least one of the 3 even spades.Which is equal to:Sum over k=1 to 3 of [C(3,k) * (number of ways to distribute the remaining 6 - k cards to RB and DB, each getting at least one card)].Wait, that might not be the right approach.Alternatively, for each even spade, the number of distributions where DBR has that spade is:For one specific even spade, say 2 of spades, the number of distributions where DBR has 2 is:1 (for DBR) * (number of ways to distribute the remaining 5 cards to RB and DB, each getting at least one card) = 1 * (2^5 - 2) = 30.Similarly, for each of the 3 even spades, it's 30.But then, using inclusion-exclusion, the total number is:3*30 - 3*(number of distributions where DBR has two specific even spades) + 1*(number of distributions where DBR has all three even spades).So, let's compute that.First term: 3*30 = 90.Second term: For each pair of even spades, the number of distributions where DBR has both is:C(3,2) = 3 pairs.For each pair, the number of distributions is 1 (for DBR having both) * (number of ways to distribute the remaining 4 cards to RB and DB, each getting at least one card) = 1 * (2^4 - 2) = 14.So, second term: 3*14 = 42.Third term: Number of distributions where DBR has all three even spades is:1 (for DBR having all three) * (number of ways to distribute the remaining 3 cards to RB and DB, each getting at least one card) = 1 * (2^3 - 2) = 6.Therefore, by inclusion-exclusion, the number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade is:90 - 42 + 6 = 54.Wait, that's way less than 426.Wait, that can't be right.Wait, no, actually, this approach is wrong because it's considering only the distributions where DBR has exactly those even spades, but the rest of the cards can go anywhere.Wait, no, actually, in this approach, for each even spade, we're counting the number of distributions where DBR has that specific even spade, regardless of the others.But this is overcounting because distributions where DBR has multiple even spades are counted multiple times.Therefore, inclusion-exclusion is necessary.But according to this, the number is 54, which is way less than 426.Therefore, this approach is wrong.Wait, perhaps because in this approach, we're not considering that the other cards can also be distributed to DBR, RB, and DB, not just RB and DB.Wait, no, in the initial approach, when we fix that DBR has a specific even spade, the rest of the cards can go to any player, but in this case, we're only considering distributions where DBR has that specific even spade, and the rest can go anywhere, including DBR.Wait, but in our problem, each player must have at least one card.Therefore, when we fix that DBR has a specific even spade, the rest of the cards can be distributed to DBR, RB, and DB, but ensuring that RB and DB each get at least one card.Wait, no, because if we fix that DBR has a specific even spade, the remaining 5 cards can be distributed to DBR, RB, and DB, but we must ensure that RB and DB each get at least one card.Therefore, the number of distributions where DBR has a specific even spade is:1 (for DBR having that spade) * (number of ways to distribute the remaining 5 cards to DBR, RB, and DB, with RB and DB each getting at least one card).But since DBR can get any number of the remaining 5 cards, including all, the number of ways is equal to:Total distributions of 5 cards to 3 players: 3^5.Minus distributions where RB gets nothing: 2^5.Minus distributions where DB gets nothing: 2^5.Plus distributions where both RB and DB get nothing: 1^5.So, by inclusion-exclusion, it's 3^5 - 2*2^5 + 1^5.Compute that:3^5 = 2432^5 = 32, so 2*32 = 641^5 = 1So, 243 - 64 + 1 = 180.Therefore, the number of distributions where DBR has a specific even spade is 180.Therefore, for each of the 3 even spades, it's 180.But then, using inclusion-exclusion, the total number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade is:3*180 - 3*(number of distributions where DBR has two specific even spades) + 1*(number of distributions where DBR has all three even spades).Compute each term.First term: 3*180 = 540.Second term: For each pair of even spades, compute the number of distributions where DBR has both.For two specific even spades, the number of distributions is:1 (for DBR having both) * (number of ways to distribute the remaining 4 cards to DBR, RB, and DB, with RB and DB each getting at least one card).Which is:3^4 - 2*2^4 + 1^4 = 81 - 32 + 1 = 50.Therefore, for each pair, it's 50.There are C(3,2)=3 pairs.So, second term: 3*50 = 150.Third term: Number of distributions where DBR has all three even spades.Which is:1 (for DBR having all three) * (number of ways to distribute the remaining 3 cards to DBR, RB, and DB, with RB and DB each getting at least one card).Which is:3^3 - 2*2^3 + 1^3 = 27 - 16 + 1 = 12.Therefore, third term: 12.Therefore, total number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade is:540 - 150 + 12 = 402.Wait, that's different from the previous 426.Wait, so now I have 402, which is still different from both 450 and 426.This is getting too convoluted.Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the inclusion-exclusion is being misapplied.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when we fix DBR to have a specific even spade, we're not accounting for the fact that the rest of the cards can go to any player, including DBR, which might lead to overcounting.Wait, perhaps the correct way to compute |B| is as follows:The number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade is equal to the total number of distributions minus the number of distributions where DBR has no even spades.Which we computed earlier as 540 - 114 = 426.Therefore, |B| = 426.Therefore, inclusion-exclusion gives |A ∪ B| = 360 + 426 - 312 = 474.But according to the complement approach, it's 450.So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the complement approach is wrong because it's not considering that DBR could have more than one odd card.Wait, no, the condition is DBR has more than one card OR DBR has an even spade.So, the complement is DBR has exactly one card AND it's odd.Therefore, the number of such distributions is 3 * (2^5 - 2) = 90.Therefore, total valid distributions = 540 - 90 = 450.Therefore, the first approach is correct.Therefore, the answer is 450.But why does inclusion-exclusion give a different answer?Wait, perhaps because in inclusion-exclusion, |A ∩ B| is being miscalculated.Wait, let me think again.|A| is the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card: 360.|B| is the number of distributions where DBR has at least one even spade: 426.|A ∩ B| is the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card AND at least one even spade.But how is this calculated?It's equal to |A| - |A ∩ not B|.Where |A ∩ not B| is the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card and no even spades.Which we computed as 48.Therefore, |A ∩ B| = 360 - 48 = 312.Therefore, |A ∪ B| = 360 + 426 - 312 = 474.But according to the complement approach, it's 450.So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the inclusion-exclusion approach, we're double-counting something.Alternatively, perhaps the complement approach is correct, and the inclusion-exclusion is wrong because of overlapping counts.Wait, let me think of another way.Let me compute the number of distributions where DBR has more than one card OR DBR has an even spade.This can be broken down into:1. DBR has more than one card, regardless of the spades.2. DBR has exactly one card, but it's an even spade.So, total valid distributions = (number of distributions where DBR has more than one card) + (number of distributions where DBR has exactly one even spade).Compute each term.First term: 360.Second term: Number of distributions where DBR has exactly one even spade.There are 3 even spades. For each, DBR has that one, and the remaining 5 cards are distributed to RB and DB, each getting at least one.So, for each even spade, number of distributions is 1 (for DBR) * (2^5 - 2) = 30.Therefore, total for all three even spades: 3 * 30 = 90.Therefore, total valid distributions = 360 + 90 = 450.Ah! That's the same as the complement approach.Therefore, the correct answer is 450.Therefore, the inclusion-exclusion approach was incorrect because I misapplied it.Therefore, the correct answer is 450.**Final Answer**The number of ways the players' hands can be distributed is boxed{450}."},{"question":"Dad is a years old this year, which is 4 times plus 3 years more than Xiao Hong's age this year.

Let B equal the number of four digit multiples of 5.  Find A+B.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find A, the number of four-digit odd numbers, and B, the number of four-digit multiples of 5. Then, I have to add them together to get A + B. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, let's tackle A, the number of four-digit odd numbers. A four-digit number ranges from 1000 to 9999, right? So, the first digit can't be zero because otherwise, it wouldn't be a four-digit number. The number has to be odd, which means the last digit has to be an odd number. The odd digits are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. So, the last digit has 5 possible choices.Now, let's think about the other digits. The first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9, so that's 9 choices. The second and third digits can be any digit from 0 to 9, so that's 10 choices each. The last digit, as we established, has 5 choices.So, to find the total number of four-digit odd numbers, I can multiply the number of choices for each digit together. That would be 9 (for the first digit) multiplied by 10 (for the second digit) multiplied by 10 (for the third digit) multiplied by 5 (for the last digit). Let me write that out:A = 9 × 10 × 10 × 5Let me compute that. 9 × 10 is 90, 90 × 10 is 900, and 900 × 5 is 4500. So, A is 4500. That seems right because for each of the first three digits, we have a lot of possibilities, and the last digit is restricted to 5 options.Now, moving on to B, which is the number of four-digit multiples of 5. A multiple of 5 must end with either 0 or 5. So, similar to the previous problem, the last digit has 2 choices: 0 or 5.Again, the first digit can't be zero, so it has 9 choices. The second and third digits can be anything from 0 to 9, so 10 choices each. The last digit has 2 choices.So, the total number of four-digit multiples of 5 would be 9 × 10 × 10 × 2. Let me calculate that. 9 × 10 is 90, 90 × 10 is 900, and 900 × 2 is 1800. So, B is 1800.Wait a second, hold on. I just realized something. When I calculated A, I considered numbers ending with 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, which are all odd. For B, I considered numbers ending with 0 or 5, which are multiples of 5. But some numbers might be both odd and multiples of 5. Specifically, numbers ending with 5. So, if I just add A and B together, I might be double-counting those numbers that end with 5.Hmm, so I need to check if there's an overlap between A and B. Let me think. A includes numbers ending with 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. B includes numbers ending with 0 or 5. So, the overlap is numbers ending with 5. So, those numbers are being counted in both A and B.Therefore, when I add A and B, I need to subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting. So, the total A + B should be A + B - overlap.So, how many numbers are in the overlap? These are four-digit numbers ending with 5. So, similar to before, the first digit has 9 choices, the second and third digits have 10 choices each, and the last digit is fixed at 5. So, the number of overlapping numbers is 9 × 10 × 10 × 1 = 900.Therefore, A + B = 4500 + 1800 - 900 = 5400.Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, A is 4500, B is 1800, and the overlap is 900. So, 4500 + 1800 is 6300, minus 900 is 5400. That seems correct.But let me verify this another way. The total number of four-digit numbers is from 1000 to 9999, which is 9000 numbers. Now, how many of these are odd? Well, every other number is odd, so that's 9000 / 2 = 4500. That matches my A.How many are multiples of 5? Well, multiples of 5 occur every 5 numbers. So, from 1000 to 9999, how many multiples of 5 are there? The first multiple of 5 in this range is 1000, and the last is 9995. So, the number of multiples of 5 is ((9995 - 1000) / 5) + 1. Let me compute that: (8995 / 5) + 1 = 1799 + 1 = 1800. That matches my B.Now, how many numbers are both odd and multiples of 5? These are the numbers ending with 5, as we discussed. So, the count is 900, as calculated earlier.Therefore, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of four-digit numbers that are either odd or multiples of 5 is A + B - overlap = 4500 + 1800 - 900 = 5400.Alternatively, I can think of it as the union of two sets: the set of four-digit odd numbers and the set of four-digit multiples of 5. The union's size is the sum of the sizes minus the intersection.So, that seems consistent.Wait, but the problem says \\"Let A equal the number of four digit odd numbers. Let B equal the number of four digit multiples of 5. Find A + B.\\" So, does it just want A + B, regardless of overlap? Or does it want the count of numbers that are either odd or multiples of 5, which would be A + B - overlap?Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \\"Let A equal the number of four digit odd numbers. Let B equal the number of four digit multiples of 5. Find A + B.\\"So, it's just asking for A + B, not the union. So, perhaps I don't need to subtract the overlap. So, A is 4500, B is 1800, so A + B is 6300.But wait, that seems contradictory to my earlier reasoning. Because if I just add them, I'm double-counting the numbers that are both odd and multiples of 5.But the problem says \\"Let A equal the number... Let B equal the number... Find A + B.\\" So, unless it's specified that they want the count of numbers that are either A or B, it's just the sum of A and B.So, maybe I was overcomplicating it earlier. Maybe the answer is simply 4500 + 1800 = 6300.But wait, let me think again. If the problem had said \\"Find the number of four-digit numbers that are odd or multiples of 5,\\" then we would have to subtract the overlap. But since it's just asking for A + B, where A is the count of odd numbers and B is the count of multiples of 5, regardless of overlap, then it's just 4500 + 1800 = 6300.But now I'm confused because in the initial reasoning, I thought of the union, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says \\"Find A + B,\\" where A and B are defined as counts.So, maybe the answer is 6300.Wait, but let me check the problem statement again: \\"Let A equal the number of four digit odd numbers. Let B equal the number of four digit multiples of 5. Find A + B.\\"Yes, it's just asking for A + B, not the size of the union. So, A is 4500, B is 1800, so A + B is 6300.But then, why did I think of the overlap earlier? Because in some problems, when you're asked for the total, you have to consider overlaps, but in this case, since it's just A + B, it's just the sum.Wait, but let me think of it another way. If I have two sets, A and B, then |A| + |B| is not the same as |A ∪ B|. So, if the problem had asked for the number of four-digit numbers that are either odd or multiples of 5, then it would be |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B| = 5400.But since the problem is just asking for A + B, which is 4500 + 1800 = 6300, regardless of overlap.So, perhaps the answer is 6300.But now I'm second-guessing myself because sometimes in combinatorics, when you're adding counts, you have to be careful about overlaps, but in this case, the problem is straightforward: A is one count, B is another count, and it's just asking for their sum.Therefore, I think the answer is 6300.Wait, but let me verify with another approach. Let's compute A and B separately and then add them.A: four-digit odd numbers.First digit: 1-9 (9 options)Second digit: 0-9 (10 options)Third digit: 0-9 (10 options)Fourth digit: 1,3,5,7,9 (5 options)So, A = 9 × 10 × 10 × 5 = 4500.B: four-digit multiples of 5.First digit: 1-9 (9 options)Second digit: 0-9 (10 options)Third digit: 0-9 (10 options)Fourth digit: 0 or 5 (2 options)So, B = 9 × 10 × 10 × 2 = 1800.So, A + B = 4500 + 1800 = 6300.Therefore, the answer is 6300.But wait, earlier I thought that numbers ending with 5 are being counted in both A and B, so if we just add them, we'd be double-counting those. But the problem is not asking for the union; it's just asking for A + B. So, in that case, it's acceptable to have the double-counting because we're just adding the two counts, not combining the sets.So, for example, if I have 2 apples and 3 oranges, the total number of fruits is 5. But if I have 2 apples and 3 fruits, and some apples are also fruits, then the total number of fruits would be less. But in this case, the problem is not asking for the total number of numbers that are either odd or multiples of 5; it's just asking for A + B, where A is the count of odd numbers and B is the count of multiples of 5. So, it's like having two separate counts and adding them together, regardless of overlap.Therefore, I think the answer is 6300.But to be absolutely sure, let me think of a smaller example. Suppose we have two-digit numbers.Let A be the number of two-digit odd numbers.A: first digit 1-9, second digit 1,3,5,7,9. So, 9 × 5 = 45.Let B be the number of two-digit multiples of 5.B: first digit 1-9, second digit 0 or 5. So, 9 × 2 = 18.Now, A + B = 45 + 18 = 63.But the total number of two-digit numbers is 90 (from 10 to 99). The number of two-digit numbers that are odd or multiples of 5 would be A + B - overlap.Overlap is two-digit numbers ending with 5: 9 × 1 = 9.So, |A ∪ B| = 45 + 18 - 9 = 54.But if we just add A and B, it's 63, which is more than the total number of two-digit numbers. That doesn't make sense because you can't have more numbers in the union than the total set.Wait, that's a problem. So, in the two-digit case, A + B = 63, but the total two-digit numbers are only 90, so the union can't be 63. Wait, no, actually, the union is 54, which is less than 90.But in the two-digit case, if I just add A and B, I get 63, which is higher than the total number of two-digit numbers. That suggests that in the two-digit case, adding A and B without subtracting the overlap gives a number larger than the total set, which is impossible because the union can't exceed the total.Therefore, in the original problem, adding A and B without considering overlap would give a number larger than the total four-digit numbers, which is 9000. Let's check: 4500 + 1800 = 6300, which is less than 9000, so that's fine.But in the two-digit case, adding A and B gives 63, which is more than the total two-digit numbers (90). Wait, no, 63 is less than 90. Wait, 63 is less than 90, so that's okay.Wait, 63 is less than 90, so it's possible. So, in the two-digit case, A + B is 63, which is less than 90, so it's acceptable.But in the four-digit case, A + B is 6300, which is less than 9000, so that's also acceptable.Therefore, in the original problem, A + B is 6300, and that's the answer.But just to make sure, let me think of another way. If I list all four-digit odd numbers and all four-digit multiples of 5, how many numbers would that be? Well, some numbers are both odd and multiples of 5, so they are counted twice. But since the problem is just asking for A + B, not the union, it's acceptable to have those duplicates in the count.Therefore, the answer is 6300.Wait, but let me think again. If I have 4500 odd numbers and 1800 multiples of 5, and 900 of them are overlapping, then the total unique numbers would be 5400, but the problem isn't asking for unique numbers; it's just asking for A + B. So, A + B is 6300.Therefore, the answer is 6300.But to confirm, let me think of another example. Suppose I have a set of numbers from 1 to 10.Let A be the number of odd numbers: 1,3,5,7,9 => 5 numbers.Let B be the number of multiples of 5: 5,10 => 2 numbers.So, A + B = 5 + 2 = 7.But the union of A and B is {1,3,5,7,9,10} => 6 numbers.So, A + B is 7, which is more than the union because of the overlap (number 5 is counted twice). But since the problem is just asking for A + B, it's 7.Therefore, in the original problem, A + B is 6300, regardless of the overlap.Therefore, the answer is 6300.But wait, in the two-digit example, A + B was 63, which is more than the union (54). But in the four-digit case, A + B is 6300, which is more than the union (5400). So, the problem is just asking for A + B, so 6300 is the answer.Therefore, I think the answer is 6300.**Final Answer**boxed{6300}"},{"question":"Insert three numbers a_1, a_2, a_3 between -8 and 10, so that these five numbers form an arithmetic sequence.

How many turns can Barry take standing on his head during a single 2-hour period?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total time Barry spends on each activity during one cycle. He stands on his head for 10 minutes and then sits for 5 minutes, making one complete cycle 15 minutes long.Next, I'll calculate how many full cycles Barry can complete in a 2-hour period. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, I'll divide 120 by 15 to find the number of cycles. This gives me 8 cycles.Finally, since Barry stands on his head once per cycle, the total number of turns he can take is equal to the number of cycles, which is 8."},{"question":"Given the sets A={1,2^{m}} and B={0,2}. If Acup B={0,1,2,8}, then the value of the real number m is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I'm given two sets, A and B. Set A is {1, 2^m} and set B is {0, 2}. It also says that the union of A and B is {0, 1, 2, 8}. I need to find the value of the real number m. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me recall what a union of two sets means. The union of sets A and B, written as A ∪ B, is a set that contains all the elements that are in A, in B, or in both. So, if A is {1, 2^m} and B is {0, 2}, then A ∪ B should have all the elements from both sets combined without any duplicates.Given that A ∪ B is {0, 1, 2, 8}, that means when we combine A and B, we end up with four elements: 0, 1, 2, and 8. Let me write down what I know:- A = {1, 2^m}- B = {0, 2}- A ∪ B = {0, 1, 2, 8}So, when we take the union, we should have all the elements from A and B together. Let me list the elements:From A: 1 and 2^mFrom B: 0 and 2So, combining these, we should have 0, 1, 2, and 2^m. But the union is given as {0, 1, 2, 8}. That means that 2^m must be equal to 8 because that's the only element not already in B or A. So, 2^m = 8.Now, I need to solve for m in the equation 2^m = 8. Hmm, okay, 2 raised to what power gives me 8? Let's think about powers of 2:- 2^1 = 2- 2^2 = 4- 2^3 = 8Ah, so 2^3 is 8. Therefore, m must be 3. Let me double-check that.If m is 3, then set A becomes {1, 2^3} which is {1, 8}. Then, set B is {0, 2}. So, the union of A and B would be {0, 1, 2, 8}, which matches exactly what's given. That seems to make sense.Wait, but just to be thorough, are there any other possibilities? For example, could 2^m be equal to 0 or 1 or 2? Let's see.If 2^m were 0, that's impossible because 2 raised to any real number is always positive and never zero. So, 2^m can't be 0.If 2^m were 1, then m would have to be 0 because 2^0 = 1. But if m is 0, then set A would be {1, 1}, which is just {1}, right? So, the union of A and B would be {0, 1, 2}, but that's only three elements, not four. The given union has four elements, so 2^m can't be 1.Similarly, if 2^m were 2, then m would be 1 because 2^1 = 2. Then, set A would be {1, 2}, and set B is {0, 2}. The union would be {0, 1, 2}, again only three elements. But we need four elements in the union, so 2^m can't be 2 either.Therefore, the only possibility is that 2^m = 8, which gives m = 3. That seems to be the only solution that works.Just to recap:- A ∪ B must have four elements: 0, 1, 2, and 8.- From set A, we get 1 and 2^m.- From set B, we get 0 and 2.- The only new element needed is 8, so 2^m must be 8.- Solving 2^m = 8 gives m = 3.- Checking this, A becomes {1, 8}, B is {0, 2}, and their union is {0, 1, 2, 8}, which matches.So, I think that's solid. I don't see any other possibilities or mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, m must be 3.**Final Answer**The value of ( m ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Given that the square root of 4a-11 is pm 3, and the arithmetic square root of 3a+b-1 is 1, and c is the integer part of sqrt{20}.  (1) Find the values of a, b, and c;  (2) Find the cube root of -2a+b-c.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to find the values of a, b, and c, and then find the cube root of -2a + b - c. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the problem says that the square root of (4a - 11) is ±3. Hmm, so that means if I square both sides, I can get an equation for a. Let me write that down.√(4a - 11) = ±3If I square both sides, it becomes:(√(4a - 11))² = (±3)²Which simplifies to:4a - 11 = 9Wait, because squaring a square root just gives the original expression, and squaring ±3 gives 9. So, 4a - 11 = 9. Now, solving for a:4a = 9 + 114a = 20a = 20 / 4a = 5Okay, so a is 5. That seems straightforward.Next, the problem mentions the arithmetic square root of (3a + b - 1) is 1. Arithmetic square root usually refers to the principal (non-negative) square root, so that would mean:√(3a + b - 1) = 1Again, if I square both sides:(√(3a + b - 1))² = 1²Which simplifies to:3a + b - 1 = 1We already found that a is 5, so let's plug that in:3*5 + b - 1 = 115 + b - 1 = 114 + b = 1Now, solving for b:b = 1 - 14b = -13Alright, so b is -13. That seems a bit negative, but I think that's okay.Now, moving on to c. The problem states that c is the integer part of √20. Hmm, √20 is approximately 4.472, right? So the integer part would be 4. Therefore, c = 4.So, summarizing:a = 5b = -13c = 4Let me just double-check these values to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, checking the square root of (4a - 11):4a - 11 = 4*5 - 11 = 20 - 11 = 9. The square root of 9 is indeed ±3, so that checks out.Next, checking the arithmetic square root of (3a + b - 1):3a + b - 1 = 3*5 + (-13) - 1 = 15 - 13 - 1 = 1. The square root of 1 is 1, so that also checks out.And c is the integer part of √20, which is 4, so that's correct too.Okay, so part (1) is done. Now, moving on to part (2): Find the cube root of (-2a + b - c).Let me compute the expression inside the cube root first:-2a + b - cPlugging in the values:-2*5 + (-13) - 4Calculating step by step:-2*5 = -10-10 + (-13) = -23-23 - 4 = -27So, the expression inside the cube root is -27. Now, the cube root of -27 is the number that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives -27.I know that (-3)^3 = -27, so the cube root of -27 is -3.Therefore, the cube root of (-2a + b - c) is -3.Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.Compute -2a + b - c:-2*5 = -10b = -13, so -10 + (-13) = -23c = 4, so -23 - 4 = -27Cube root of -27 is -3. Yep, that seems correct.So, all in all, I think I did that correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my steps.**Final Answer**(1) The values are ( a = boxed{5} ), ( b = boxed{-13} ), and ( c = boxed{4} ).(2) The cube root of ( -2a + b - c ) is ( boxed{-3} )."},{"question":"Given the numbers ( x, y in left(0, frac{pi}{2}right) ). Find the maximum value of the expressionA=frac{sqrt{cos x cos y}}{sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x}+sqrt{operatorname{ctg} y}}","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the maximum value of the expression ( A = frac{sqrt{cos x cos y}}{sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x} + sqrt{operatorname{ctg} y}} ) where ( x ) and ( y ) are both between 0 and ( frac{pi}{2} ). Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.First, I should probably recall what ( operatorname{ctg} x ) is. That's the cotangent of x, right? So ( operatorname{ctg} x = frac{cos x}{sin x} ). So, maybe I can rewrite the expression in terms of sine and cosine to simplify it.Let me write that down:( A = frac{sqrt{cos x cos y}}{sqrt{frac{cos x}{sin x}} + sqrt{frac{cos y}{sin y}}} )Simplify the denominator:( sqrt{frac{cos x}{sin x}} = frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} ) and similarly for the other term. So, the denominator becomes:( frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} + frac{sqrt{cos y}}{sqrt{sin y}} )So, putting it all together, the expression is:( A = frac{sqrt{cos x cos y}}{frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} + frac{sqrt{cos y}}{sqrt{sin y}}} )Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor out something from the numerator and denominator. Let me see.Looking at the numerator, ( sqrt{cos x cos y} ) can be written as ( sqrt{cos x} cdot sqrt{cos y} ). So, the numerator is ( sqrt{cos x} cdot sqrt{cos y} ).The denominator is ( frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} + frac{sqrt{cos y}}{sqrt{sin y}} ). So, if I factor out ( sqrt{cos x} ) and ( sqrt{cos y} ) from the denominator, maybe I can rewrite the expression.Wait, actually, let me consider dividing numerator and denominator by ( sqrt{cos x} cdot sqrt{cos y} ). Let's try that.So, numerator becomes 1, and the denominator becomes:( frac{frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} + frac{sqrt{cos y}}{sqrt{sin y}}}{sqrt{cos x} cdot sqrt{cos y}} )Simplify each term in the denominator:First term: ( frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} div (sqrt{cos x} cdot sqrt{cos y}) = frac{1}{sqrt{sin x} cdot sqrt{cos y}} )Second term: ( frac{sqrt{cos y}}{sqrt{sin y}} div (sqrt{cos x} cdot sqrt{cos y}) = frac{1}{sqrt{sin y} cdot sqrt{cos x}} )So, the denominator becomes:( frac{1}{sqrt{sin x cos y}} + frac{1}{sqrt{sin y cos x}} )Therefore, the expression ( A ) simplifies to:( A = frac{1}{frac{1}{sqrt{sin x cos y}} + frac{1}{sqrt{sin y cos x}}} )Hmm, that seems a bit better. Maybe I can write this as:( A = frac{1}{frac{1}{sqrt{sin x cos y}} + frac{1}{sqrt{sin y cos x}}} = frac{1}{frac{sqrt{sin y cos x} + sqrt{sin x cos y}}{sqrt{sin x cos y} cdot sqrt{sin y cos x}}} )Wait, that's a bit messy, but let's see:Multiplying numerator and denominator by ( sqrt{sin x cos y} cdot sqrt{sin y cos x} ), we get:( A = frac{sqrt{sin x cos y} cdot sqrt{sin y cos x}}{sqrt{sin y cos x} + sqrt{sin x cos y}} )So, ( A = frac{sqrt{sin x cos y sin y cos x}}{sqrt{sin y cos x} + sqrt{sin x cos y}} )Simplify the numerator inside the square root:( sin x cos y sin y cos x = sin x sin y cos x cos y )So, ( A = frac{sqrt{sin x sin y cos x cos y}}{sqrt{sin y cos x} + sqrt{sin x cos y}} )Hmm, maybe I can factor this differently. Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution. Let me set ( a = sqrt{sin x cos y} ) and ( b = sqrt{sin y cos x} ). Then, the expression becomes:( A = frac{sqrt{ab}}{a + b} )Wait, that might be helpful. So, ( A = frac{sqrt{ab}}{a + b} ). Hmm, that's a simpler expression.But I need to express ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of x and y, but maybe I can find a relationship between a and b.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the variables ( u = sqrt{sin x cos y} ) and ( v = sqrt{sin y cos x} ), so that ( A = frac{sqrt{uv}}{u + v} ).But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I can think about using some inequality here, like AM ≥ GM or something else.Wait, let's consider the denominator ( u + v ). Since ( u ) and ( v ) are positive, by AM ≥ GM, we have ( u + v geq 2sqrt{uv} ). So, ( frac{sqrt{uv}}{u + v} leq frac{sqrt{uv}}{2sqrt{uv}} = frac{1}{2} ). So, ( A leq frac{1}{2} ).Is this maximum achieved? When does equality hold in AM ≥ GM? When ( u = v ). So, if ( u = v ), then ( sqrt{sin x cos y} = sqrt{sin y cos x} ). Squaring both sides, we get ( sin x cos y = sin y cos x ).Which simplifies to ( sin x cos y - sin y cos x = 0 ). That is, ( sin(x - y) = 0 ). Since ( x ) and ( y ) are in ( (0, frac{pi}{2}) ), ( x - y ) must be 0. So, ( x = y ).So, if ( x = y ), then we have equality, and ( A = frac{1}{2} ). So, is ( frac{1}{2} ) the maximum value?Wait, let's check that. Let me substitute ( x = y ) into the original expression.So, if ( x = y ), then ( A = frac{sqrt{cos^2 x}}{sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x} + sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x}} = frac{cos x}{2 sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x}} )Simplify ( sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x} = sqrt{frac{cos x}{sin x}} = frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} ). So, denominator is ( 2 cdot frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} ).So, ( A = frac{cos x}{2 cdot frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}}} = frac{cos x cdot sqrt{sin x}}{2 sqrt{cos x}} = frac{sqrt{cos x} cdot sqrt{sin x}}{2} = frac{sqrt{sin x cos x}}{2} )Hmm, so ( A = frac{sqrt{sin x cos x}}{2} ). To find its maximum, we can consider the maximum of ( sqrt{sin x cos x} ).We know that ( sin x cos x = frac{1}{2} sin 2x ), so ( sqrt{sin x cos x} = sqrt{frac{1}{2} sin 2x} = frac{sqrt{sin 2x}}{sqrt{2}} ).The maximum of ( sin 2x ) is 1, so the maximum of ( sqrt{sin x cos x} ) is ( frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ). Therefore, the maximum of ( A ) in this case is ( frac{1}{sqrt{2}} cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} approx 0.3535 ).Wait, but earlier I thought ( A leq frac{1}{2} ) and equality when ( x = y ). But substituting ( x = y ) gives a maximum of ( frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ), which is less than ( frac{1}{2} ). So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider. Let me go back.So, I had ( A = frac{sqrt{sin x sin y cos x cos y}}{sqrt{sin y cos x} + sqrt{sin x cos y}} ). Let me denote ( a = sqrt{sin x cos y} ) and ( b = sqrt{sin y cos x} ), so ( A = frac{sqrt{ab}}{a + b} ).Wait, so ( A = frac{sqrt{ab}}{a + b} ). Let me denote ( t = sqrt{frac{a}{b}} ), so ( a = t^2 b ). Then, ( A = frac{sqrt{t^2 b^2}}{t^2 b + b} = frac{t b}{b(t^2 + 1)} = frac{t}{t^2 + 1} ).So, ( A = frac{t}{t^2 + 1} ). To find the maximum of this expression with respect to t > 0.Taking derivative: Let ( f(t) = frac{t}{t^2 + 1} ). Then, ( f'(t) = frac{(1)(t^2 + 1) - t(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = frac{t^2 + 1 - 2t^2}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = frac{1 - t^2}{(t^2 + 1)^2} ).Setting derivative to zero: ( 1 - t^2 = 0 ) => ( t = 1 ). So, maximum at t = 1, which gives ( f(1) = frac{1}{2} ). So, the maximum of ( A ) is ( frac{1}{2} ).But wait, earlier when I substituted ( x = y ), I only got ( frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ). So, there's a contradiction here. That suggests that my substitution might have been incorrect or that the maximum occurs when ( x neq y ).Wait, so if ( t = 1 ), that implies ( sqrt{frac{a}{b}} = 1 ) => ( a = b ) => ( sqrt{sin x cos y} = sqrt{sin y cos x} ) => ( sin x cos y = sin y cos x ) => ( sin(x - y) = 0 ) => ( x = y ).But when ( x = y ), I only get ( A = frac{sqrt{sin x cos x}}{2} ), which has a maximum of ( frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ). So, why does the substitution method suggest that the maximum is ( frac{1}{2} )?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check.I set ( a = sqrt{sin x cos y} ) and ( b = sqrt{sin y cos x} ). Then, ( A = frac{sqrt{ab}}{a + b} ). Then, I set ( t = sqrt{frac{a}{b}} ), so ( a = t^2 b ). Then, ( A = frac{sqrt{t^2 b^2}}{t^2 b + b} = frac{t b}{b(t^2 + 1)} = frac{t}{t^2 + 1} ). So, that seems correct.Then, the maximum of ( frac{t}{t^2 + 1} ) is ( frac{1}{2} ) when ( t = 1 ). So, that suggests that ( A ) can reach ( frac{1}{2} ).But when I plug ( x = y ), I only get ( frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ). So, perhaps the maximum occurs when ( x neq y ). So, maybe my initial assumption that ( x = y ) gives the maximum is wrong.Wait, maybe I need to consider another approach. Let me try using substitution variables.Let me set ( u = sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x} ) and ( v = sqrt{operatorname{ctg} y} ). Then, ( operatorname{ctg} x = u^2 ) and ( operatorname{ctg} y = v^2 ). So, ( cos x = u^2 sin x ) and ( cos y = v^2 sin y ).But ( cos^2 x + sin^2 x = 1 ), so ( (u^2 sin x)^2 + sin^2 x = 1 ) => ( sin^2 x (u^4 + 1) = 1 ) => ( sin x = frac{1}{sqrt{u^4 + 1}} ), similarly ( sin y = frac{1}{sqrt{v^4 + 1}} ).Then, ( cos x = u^2 sin x = frac{u^2}{sqrt{u^4 + 1}} ), and ( cos y = frac{v^2}{sqrt{v^4 + 1}} ).So, the numerator of A is ( sqrt{cos x cos y} = sqrt{frac{u^2}{sqrt{u^4 + 1}} cdot frac{v^2}{sqrt{v^4 + 1}}} = frac{uv}{sqrt{(u^4 + 1)(v^4 + 1)}} ).The denominator is ( u + v ).So, the expression becomes:( A = frac{frac{uv}{sqrt{(u^4 + 1)(v^4 + 1)}}}{u + v} = frac{uv}{(u + v)sqrt{(u^4 + 1)(v^4 + 1)}} )Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe I can set ( u = v ) to see if that gives a higher value.If ( u = v ), then ( A = frac{u^2}{(2u)sqrt{(u^4 + 1)^2}} = frac{u}{2(u^4 + 1)} ).To maximize ( frac{u}{2(u^4 + 1)} ), take derivative with respect to u:Let ( f(u) = frac{u}{2(u^4 + 1)} ). Then, ( f'(u) = frac{(1)(2(u^4 + 1)) - u(8u^3)}{[2(u^4 + 1)]^2} ). Wait, no, that's incorrect.Wait, actually, ( f(u) = frac{u}{2(u^4 + 1)} ), so ( f'(u) = frac{(1)(2(u^4 + 1)) - u(8u^3)}{[2(u^4 + 1)]^2} ). Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, actually, ( f(u) = frac{u}{2(u^4 + 1)} ), so ( f'(u) = frac{(1)(2(u^4 + 1)) - u(8u^3)}{[2(u^4 + 1)]^2} ). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly.Using quotient rule: ( f'(u) = frac{(1)(2(u^4 + 1)) - u(8u^3)}{[2(u^4 + 1)]^2} ). Wait, no, actually, the denominator is squared, but the numerator is derivative of numerator times denominator minus numerator times derivative of denominator.Wait, actually, ( f(u) = frac{u}{2(u^4 + 1)} ). So, ( f'(u) = frac{(1)(2(u^4 + 1)) - u(8u^3)}{[2(u^4 + 1)]^2} ). Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, no, the derivative of the numerator is 1, and the derivative of the denominator is ( 2 cdot 4u^3 = 8u^3 ). So, using quotient rule:( f'(u) = frac{1 cdot 2(u^4 + 1) - u cdot 8u^3}{[2(u^4 + 1)]^2} )Simplify numerator:( 2(u^4 + 1) - 8u^4 = 2u^4 + 2 - 8u^4 = -6u^4 + 2 )Set numerator to zero:( -6u^4 + 2 = 0 ) => ( 6u^4 = 2 ) => ( u^4 = frac{1}{3} ) => ( u = left( frac{1}{3} right)^{1/4} = frac{1}{sqrt[4]{3}} )So, maximum at ( u = frac{1}{sqrt[4]{3}} ). Then, ( f(u) = frac{frac{1}{sqrt[4]{3}}}{2left( left( frac{1}{sqrt[4]{3}} right)^4 + 1 right)} = frac{frac{1}{sqrt[4]{3}}}{2left( frac{1}{3} + 1 right)} = frac{frac{1}{sqrt[4]{3}}}{2 cdot frac{4}{3}} = frac{1}{sqrt[4]{3}} cdot frac{3}{8} = frac{3}{8 sqrt[4]{3}} )Simplify ( sqrt[4]{3} = 3^{1/4} ), so ( frac{3}{8 cdot 3^{1/4}} = frac{3^{3/4}}{8} approx frac{2.2795}{8} approx 0.2849 ). Hmm, which is less than ( frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} approx 0.3535 ). So, maybe setting ( u = v ) doesn't give the maximum.Wait, but earlier when I considered ( A = frac{sqrt{ab}}{a + b} ), I found that the maximum is ( frac{1}{2} ) when ( a = b ). But when ( a = b ), that implies ( sqrt{sin x cos y} = sqrt{sin y cos x} ), which leads to ( x = y ), but when ( x = y ), the maximum of ( A ) is only ( frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ). So, perhaps my substitution is wrong.Wait, maybe I need to consider another approach. Let me try to use the AM-GM inequality on the denominator.We have ( sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x} + sqrt{operatorname{ctg} y} geq 2 sqrt{sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x} cdot sqrt{operatorname{ctg} y}} = 2 (operatorname{ctg} x operatorname{ctg} y)^{1/4} ).So, ( A leq frac{sqrt{cos x cos y}}{2 (operatorname{ctg} x operatorname{ctg} y)^{1/4}} ).Simplify ( operatorname{ctg} x = frac{cos x}{sin x} ), so ( (operatorname{ctg} x operatorname{ctg} y)^{1/4} = left( frac{cos x cos y}{sin x sin y} right)^{1/4} ).So, ( A leq frac{sqrt{cos x cos y}}{2 left( frac{cos x cos y}{sin x sin y} right)^{1/4}} = frac{(cos x cos y)^{1/2}}{2 (cos x cos y)^{1/4} (sin x sin y)^{-1/4}}} )Simplify exponents:( (cos x cos y)^{1/2 - 1/4} = (cos x cos y)^{1/4} )And ( (sin x sin y)^{1/4} )So, ( A leq frac{(cos x cos y)^{1/4} (sin x sin y)^{1/4}}{2} = frac{(cos x cos y sin x sin y)^{1/4}}{2} )Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can write ( cos x cos y sin x sin y = (sin x cos x)(sin y cos y) = frac{1}{4} sin 2x sin 2y ).So, ( A leq frac{(frac{1}{4} sin 2x sin 2y)^{1/4}}{2} = frac{( sin 2x sin 2y )^{1/4}}{2 cdot 4^{1/4}} = frac{( sin 2x sin 2y )^{1/4}}{2 cdot sqrt[4]{4}} )But this doesn't seem helpful. Maybe another approach.Let me consider substituting ( x = y ). Earlier, I found that when ( x = y ), ( A = frac{sqrt{sin x cos x}}{2} ), which has a maximum at ( x = frac{pi}{4} ), giving ( A = frac{sqrt{frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}}{2} = frac{sqrt{frac{1}{2}}}{2} = frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{4} approx 0.3535 ).But earlier, using substitution, I thought ( A ) could reach ( frac{1}{2} ). So, which one is correct?Wait, maybe I need to test specific values. Let me try ( x = frac{pi}{4} ) and ( y = frac{pi}{4} ). Then, ( cos x = cos y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), so numerator is ( sqrt{frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} = sqrt{frac{1}{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ).Denominator: ( sqrt{operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{4}} + sqrt{operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{4}} = sqrt{1} + sqrt{1} = 1 + 1 = 2 ).So, ( A = frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{4} approx 0.3535 ).Now, let me try ( x = frac{pi}{6} ) and ( y = frac{pi}{3} ). Then, ( cos x = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ), ( cos y = frac{1}{2} ). So, numerator is ( sqrt{frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{frac{sqrt{3}}{4}} = frac{3^{1/4}}{2} approx 0.683 ).Denominator: ( sqrt{operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{6}} + sqrt{operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{3}} ).( operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{6} = sqrt{3} ), so ( sqrt{sqrt{3}} = 3^{1/4} approx 1.316 ).( operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{3} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ), so ( sqrt{frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} = 3^{-1/4} approx 0.7598 ).So, denominator is approximately ( 1.316 + 0.7598 approx 2.0758 ).So, ( A approx frac{0.683}{2.0758} approx 0.329 ), which is less than 0.3535.Hmm, so in this case, ( A ) is smaller.Wait, let me try another set: ( x = frac{pi}{6} ), ( y = frac{pi}{6} ).Then, ( cos x = cos y = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ), so numerator is ( sqrt{frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = sqrt{frac{3}{4}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} approx 0.866 ).Denominator: ( sqrt{operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{6}} + sqrt{operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{6}} = 2 cdot sqrt{sqrt{3}} = 2 cdot 3^{1/4} approx 2 cdot 1.316 approx 2.632 ).So, ( A approx frac{0.866}{2.632} approx 0.329 ), again less than 0.3535.Wait, so maybe ( x = y = frac{pi}{4} ) gives the maximum. But earlier, when I thought ( A ) could reach ( frac{1}{2} ), that seems conflicting.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution earlier. Let me go back.I had ( A = frac{sqrt{ab}}{a + b} ), where ( a = sqrt{sin x cos y} ) and ( b = sqrt{sin y cos x} ). Then, I set ( t = sqrt{frac{a}{b}} ), leading to ( A = frac{t}{t^2 + 1} ), which has a maximum of ( frac{1}{2} ) at ( t = 1 ). But when ( t = 1 ), ( a = b ), which implies ( sin x cos y = sin y cos x ), which implies ( x = y ). But when ( x = y ), ( A ) only reaches ( frac{sqrt{2}}{4} approx 0.3535 ), not ( frac{1}{2} ).So, perhaps my substitution is wrong, or I misapplied the inequality.Wait, no, actually, when I set ( t = sqrt{frac{a}{b}} ), I assumed ( a ) and ( b ) are independent variables, but in reality, ( a ) and ( b ) are dependent because ( x ) and ( y ) are variables in the same expression. So, perhaps the maximum of ( frac{sqrt{ab}}{a + b} ) is not necessarily ( frac{1}{2} ) because ( a ) and ( b ) are not independent.Wait, but in reality, ( a ) and ( b ) are related through ( x ) and ( y ), so perhaps the maximum is indeed lower.Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum.Let me set ( f(x, y) = frac{sqrt{cos x cos y}}{sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x} + sqrt{operatorname{ctg} y}} ).We need to maximize ( f(x, y) ) with ( x, y in (0, frac{pi}{2}) ).Let me compute the partial derivatives.First, let me rewrite ( f(x, y) ) as:( f(x, y) = frac{sqrt{cos x cos y}}{sqrt{frac{cos x}{sin x}} + sqrt{frac{cos y}{sin y}}} = frac{sqrt{cos x cos y}}{frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} + frac{sqrt{cos y}}{sqrt{sin y}}} )Let me denote ( A = sqrt{cos x cos y} ), ( B = frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} ), ( C = frac{sqrt{cos y}}{sqrt{sin y}} ). So, ( f = frac{A}{B + C} ).To find the maximum, set the partial derivatives to zero.Compute ( frac{partial f}{partial x} = 0 ) and ( frac{partial f}{partial y} = 0 ).But this might get complicated. Let me try to compute ( frac{partial f}{partial x} ):First, ( A = (cos x cos y)^{1/2} ), so ( frac{partial A}{partial x} = frac{1}{2} (cos x cos y)^{-1/2} (-sin x cos y) = -frac{sin x cos y}{2 sqrt{cos x cos y}} = -frac{sin x sqrt{cos y}}{2 sqrt{cos x}} ).Similarly, ( B = frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} ), so ( frac{partial B}{partial x} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{-sin x}{sqrt{cos x}} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{sin x}} + frac{sqrt{cos x}}{2} cdot frac{-cos x}{(sin x)^{3/2}} ).Wait, that's getting too messy. Maybe I can use logarithmic differentiation.Let me take the natural logarithm of ( f ):( ln f = frac{1}{2} (ln cos x + ln cos y) - ln(B + C) )Then, partial derivative with respect to x:( frac{1}{f} frac{partial f}{partial x} = frac{1}{2} left( -tan x right) - frac{B'}{B + C} )Similarly, partial derivative with respect to y:( frac{1}{f} frac{partial f}{partial y} = frac{1}{2} left( -tan y right) - frac{C'}{B + C} )Setting these to zero:For x:( -frac{1}{2} tan x - frac{B'}{B + C} = 0 )For y:( -frac{1}{2} tan y - frac{C'}{B + C} = 0 )So, ( frac{B'}{B + C} = -frac{1}{2} tan x )and ( frac{C'}{B + C} = -frac{1}{2} tan y )But ( B' = frac{d}{dx} left( frac{sqrt{cos x}}{sqrt{sin x}} right ) = frac{d}{dx} left( cos^{1/2} x sin^{-1/2} x right ) )Using product rule:( B' = frac{1}{2} cos^{-1/2} x (-sin x) sin^{-1/2} x + cos^{1/2} x cdot left( -frac{1}{2} sin^{-3/2} x cos x right ) )Simplify:First term: ( -frac{1}{2} sin x cos^{-1/2} x sin^{-1/2} x = -frac{1}{2} sin x cdot (cos x sin x)^{-1/2} = -frac{1}{2} sin x cdot (sin x cos x)^{-1/2} )Second term: ( -frac{1}{2} cos^{1/2} x cdot sin^{-3/2} x cos x = -frac{1}{2} cos^{3/2} x sin^{-3/2} x )So, combining:( B' = -frac{1}{2} sin x (sin x cos x)^{-1/2} - frac{1}{2} cos^{3/2} x sin^{-3/2} x )Factor out ( -frac{1}{2} (sin x cos x)^{-1/2} ):( B' = -frac{1}{2} (sin x cos x)^{-1/2} left( sin x + cos^2 x sin^{-1} x right ) )Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I need a different approach.Wait, perhaps I can assume that the maximum occurs when ( x = y ). Earlier, when I tried ( x = y ), I found that the maximum of ( A ) is ( frac{sqrt{2}}{4} approx 0.3535 ). But when I considered the substitution ( a = sqrt{sin x cos y} ) and ( b = sqrt{sin y cos x} ), I thought the maximum could be ( frac{1}{2} ), but that seems inconsistent.Wait, maybe I can test another value where ( x neq y ). Let me try ( x = frac{pi}{6} ) and ( y = frac{pi}{3} ). Wait, I think I tried that earlier and got ( A approx 0.329 ), which is less than ( frac{sqrt{2}}{4} ).Alternatively, let me try ( x = frac{pi}{3} ) and ( y = frac{pi}{6} ). That should give the same result as above.Wait, maybe I can try ( x = frac{pi}{8} ) and ( y = frac{pi}{8} ). Then, ( cos x = cos y approx 0.9239 ), so numerator is ( sqrt{0.9239^2} = 0.9239 ).Denominator: ( sqrt{operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{8}} + sqrt{operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{8}} = 2 sqrt{operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{8}} ).( operatorname{ctg} frac{pi}{8} = frac{1 + sqrt{2}}{1} approx 2.4142 ), so ( sqrt{2.4142} approx 1.5538 ). So, denominator is ( 2 times 1.5538 approx 3.1076 ).So, ( A approx frac{0.9239}{3.1076} approx 0.297 ), which is less than ( frac{sqrt{2}}{4} ).Hmm, so it seems that the maximum occurs when ( x = y = frac{pi}{4} ), giving ( A = frac{sqrt{2}}{4} ).But earlier, using substitution, I thought the maximum could be ( frac{1}{2} ). So, perhaps my substitution was incorrect because ( a ) and ( b ) are not independent variables, and thus the maximum of ( frac{sqrt{ab}}{a + b} ) is not ( frac{1}{2} ) in this context.Alternatively, maybe I can consider using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.Let me recall that for positive real numbers, ( frac{sqrt{ab}}{a + b} leq frac{1}{2} sqrt{frac{ab}{ab}} = frac{1}{2} ). Wait, that doesn't make sense.Wait, actually, Cauchy-Schwarz says that ( (a + b)^2 leq 2(a^2 + b^2) ), but I'm not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, using the AM ≥ GM inequality on the denominator:( sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x} + sqrt{operatorname{ctg} y} geq 2 sqrt{sqrt{operatorname{ctg} x} cdot sqrt{operatorname{ctg} y}} = 2 (operatorname{ctg} x operatorname{ctg} y)^{1/4} )So, ( A leq frac{sqrt{cos x cos y}}{2 (operatorname{ctg} x operatorname{ctg} y)^{1/4}} )But ( operatorname{ctg} x = frac{cos x}{sin x} ), so ( (operatorname{ctg} x operatorname{ctg} y)^{1/4} = left( frac{cos x cos y}{sin x sin y} right)^{1/4} )So, ( A leq frac{sqrt{cos x cos y}}{2 left( frac{cos x cos y}{sin x sin y} right)^{1/4}} = frac{(cos x cos y)^{1/2}}{2 (cos x cos y)^{1/4} (sin x sin y)^{-1/4}}} = frac{(cos x cos y)^{1/4} (sin x sin y)^{1/4}}{2} )Which is ( frac{(cos x cos y sin x sin y)^{1/4}}{2} )Hmm, but this seems similar to what I had before. Maybe I can write ( cos x cos y sin x sin y = frac{1}{4} sin 2x sin 2y ), so:( A leq frac{(frac{1}{4} sin 2x sin 2y)^{1/4}}{2} = frac{(sin 2x sin 2y)^{1/4}}{2 cdot 4^{1/4}} )But ( 4^{1/4} = sqrt{2} ), so:( A leq frac{(sin 2x sin 2y)^{1/4}}{2 sqrt{2}} )The maximum of ( sin 2x sin 2y ) is 1, achieved when ( 2x = 2y = frac{pi}{2} ), i.e., ( x = y = frac{pi}{4} ). So, ( A leq frac{1^{1/4}}{2 sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{2 sqrt{2}} approx 0.3535 ), which matches the value when ( x = y = frac{pi}{4} ).Therefore, the maximum value of ( A ) is ( frac{1}{2 sqrt{2}} ), achieved when ( x = y = frac{pi}{4} ).So, after going through various approaches and checking with specific values, it seems that the maximum value of ( A ) is indeed ( frac{1}{2 sqrt{2}} )."},{"question":"Find the a, b, c in mathbb{N} such that 11^{a}+3^{b}=c^{2}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem: find natural numbers a, b, c such that 11^a + 3^b = c^2. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that 11 and 3 are both primes, so their powers will have specific properties. Maybe I can look at this equation modulo some small numbers to narrow down the possibilities for a and b.Let me consider the equation modulo 3. Since 11 is congruent to 2 mod 3, 11^a mod 3 would be 2^a. And 3^b mod 3 is 0 because 3 divides 3^b. So the equation becomes 2^a ≡ c^2 mod 3.Now, what are the quadratic residues mod 3? They are 0 and 1 because:- 0^2 ≡ 0 mod 3- 1^2 ≡ 1 mod 3- 2^2 ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3So c^2 mod 3 can only be 0 or 1. Therefore, 2^a must be congruent to 0 or 1 mod 3. But 2^a is never 0 mod 3, so it must be 1 mod 3.So 2^a ≡ 1 mod 3. Let's see when that happens.2^1 = 2 ≡ 2 mod 32^2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 32^3 = 8 ≡ 2 mod 32^4 = 16 ≡ 1 mod 3So it seems that 2^a ≡ 1 mod 3 when a is even. Therefore, a must be even. Let me note that down: a is even.Similarly, maybe I can consider the equation modulo 4. Let's see.11 mod 4 is 3, so 11^a mod 4 is 3^a. 3 mod 4 is -1, so 3^a mod 4 is (-1)^a. Since a is even, (-1)^a is 1. So 11^a ≡ 1 mod 4.3^b mod 4: 3 mod 4 is -1, so 3^b ≡ (-1)^b mod 4. So depending on whether b is even or odd, it's 1 or -1.So the equation becomes 1 + (-1)^b ≡ c^2 mod 4.Now, c^2 mod 4 can be 0 or 1 because:- 0^2 ≡ 0 mod 4- 1^2 ≡ 1 mod 4- 2^2 ≡ 0 mod 4- 3^2 ≡ 1 mod 4So c^2 mod 4 is either 0 or 1.Therefore, 1 + (-1)^b must be either 0 or 1 mod 4.Case 1: 1 + (-1)^b ≡ 0 mod 4.Then (-1)^b ≡ -1 mod 4, which implies that b is odd.Case 2: 1 + (-1)^b ≡ 1 mod 4.Then (-1)^b ≡ 0 mod 4, but (-1)^b is either 1 or -1, neither of which is 0 mod 4. So this case is impossible.Therefore, only Case 1 is possible, which means b must be odd.So far, I have that a is even and b is odd.Let me try small values for a and b since they are natural numbers, so starting from 1.But wait, a must be even, so a can be 2, 4, 6, etc. Similarly, b must be odd, so b can be 1, 3, 5, etc.Let me start with a=2, since it's the smallest even natural number.So, 11^2 + 3^b = c^2.11^2 is 121. So 121 + 3^b = c^2.Let me compute 3^b for small odd b:b=1: 3^1=3, so 121+3=124. Is 124 a perfect square? 10^2=100, 11^2=121, 12^2=144. 124 is between 121 and 144, not a square.b=3: 3^3=27, 121+27=148. 12^2=144, 13^2=169. 148 is not a square.b=5: 3^5=243, 121+243=364. 19^2=361, 20^2=400. 364 is not a square.b=7: 3^7=2187, 121+2187=2308. Hmm, sqrt(2308) is approximately 48.05, 48^2=2304, 49^2=2401. So 2308 is not a square.Okay, maybe a=2 doesn't work. Let's try a=4.11^4 is 14641. So 14641 + 3^b = c^2.Compute 3^b for small odd b:b=1: 3, 14641+3=14644. Let me see sqrt(14644). 120^2=14400, 121^2=14641, 122^2=14884. So 14644 is just 3 more than 121^2, which is 14641. So 14644 is not a square.b=3: 27, 14641+27=14668. 121^2=14641, 122^2=14884. 14668 is between them, not a square.b=5: 243, 14641+243=14884. Wait, 122^2=14884. So c=122.Wait, that works! So when a=4, b=5, c=122.So 11^4 + 3^5 = 14641 + 243 = 14884 = 122^2.So that's a solution.But let me check if there are more solutions.Let me try a=6.11^6 is 1771561. So 1771561 + 3^b = c^2.3^b needs to be such that c^2 - 1771561 = 3^b.Let me see, what is sqrt(1771561 + 3^b). Let's compute 1771561 is 1331^2, since 11^6 = (11^3)^2 = 1331^2.So c^2 = 1331^2 + 3^b.So 3^b = c^2 - 1331^2 = (c - 1331)(c + 1331).Since 3^b is a power of 3, both (c - 1331) and (c + 1331) must be powers of 3.Let me denote c - 1331 = 3^k and c + 1331 = 3^m, where m > k and k + m = b.Subtracting the two equations: (c + 1331) - (c - 1331) = 3^m - 3^k = 2662.So 3^k (3^{m - k} - 1) = 2662.Now, 2662 is equal to 2 * 11^3, since 11^3=1331, so 2*1331=2662.So 3^k divides 2662. But 2662 is 2 * 11^3, which doesn't have any factors of 3. Therefore, 3^k must be 1, so k=0.Therefore, 3^{m} - 1 = 2662.So 3^m = 2663.But 2663 is not a power of 3. Let's check:3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. 2663 is between them, not a power of 3. So no solution for a=6.Similarly, a=8: 11^8 is a very large number, 214358881. Let's see if 3^b can make c^2.But 3^b = c^2 - 214358881.Again, c^2 - 214358881 = (c - 14641)(c + 14641) = 3^b.So similar to before, c - 14641 = 3^k, c + 14641 = 3^m, with m > k and k + m = b.Subtracting: 3^m - 3^k = 29282.So 3^k (3^{m - k} - 1) = 29282.Factor 29282: Let's divide by 2: 29282 / 2 = 14641, which is 11^4. So 29282 = 2 * 11^4.Again, 3^k must divide 29282, but 29282 is 2 * 11^4, which has no factors of 3. So k=0.Thus, 3^m - 1 = 29282, so 3^m = 29283.Check if 29283 is a power of 3:3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. 29283 is between them, not a power of 3. So no solution for a=8.It seems that as a increases, 11^a becomes very large, and 3^b would have to compensate, but the difference between consecutive squares grows, so it's unlikely to find another solution.Wait, let's check a=0, but a must be natural number, so a=0 is not allowed. Similarly, b=0 is not allowed.Wait, but in some definitions, natural numbers start at 1, so a=1, b=1, etc.But earlier, we saw that a must be even, so a=2,4,6,...We found a solution at a=4, b=5, c=122.Let me check if a=4 and b=5 is the only solution.Wait, maybe a=2 and b= something higher?Wait, when a=2, 11^2=121, so 121 + 3^b = c^2.We checked b=1,3,5,7, but maybe higher b?Wait, 3^b = c^2 - 121.So c^2 - 121 = (c - 11)(c + 11) = 3^b.So c - 11 = 3^k, c + 11 = 3^m, with m > k and k + m = b.Subtracting: 3^m - 3^k = 22.So 3^k (3^{m - k} - 1) = 22.22 factors: 2 * 11.So 3^k must be a factor of 22. Since 22 is 2*11, and 3^k can only be 1,3,9,... So k=0.Thus, 3^{m} - 1 = 22, so 3^m =23. But 23 is not a power of 3. So no solution for a=2.Therefore, the only solution is a=4, b=5, c=122.Wait, let me check for a=6 again, maybe I made a mistake.a=6: 11^6=1771561.So 1771561 + 3^b = c^2.We can write 3^b = c^2 - 1771561 = (c - 1331)(c + 1331).So c - 1331 = 3^k, c + 1331 = 3^m, with m > k, and 3^m - 3^k = 2662.As before, 2662=2*11^3, which doesn't have factors of 3, so k=0.Thus, 3^m =2663, which is not a power of 3. So no solution.Similarly, for a=8, 11^8=214358881.3^b = c^2 -214358881 = (c - 14641)(c + 14641).So c -14641=3^k, c +14641=3^m, 3^m -3^k=29282=2*11^4.Again, no factors of 3, so k=0, 3^m=29283, which isn't a power of 3.So no solution.Therefore, the only solution is a=4, b=5, c=122.But wait, let me check a=0, but as per natural numbers, a=0 is excluded.Similarly, b=0 is excluded.So yeah, I think that's the only solution.**Final Answer**The natural numbers are boxed{4}, boxed{5}, and boxed{122}."},{"question":"If one of the foci of the ellipse kx^2+5y^2=5 is (2,0), then k= ___.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If one of the foci of the ellipse ( kx^2 + 5y^2 = 5 ) is ( (2, 0) ), then what is ( k )? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that the general equation of an ellipse is usually written in the form ( frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. Depending on whether the major axis is along the x-axis or y-axis, the positions of ( a ) and ( b ) switch.Looking at the given equation ( kx^2 + 5y^2 = 5 ), I can try to rewrite it in the standard form by dividing both sides by 5. That would give me ( frac{kx^2}{5} + frac{5y^2}{5} = 1 ), which simplifies to ( frac{x^2}{5/k} + frac{y^2}{1} = 1 ). So, comparing this to the standard form, I can see that ( a^2 = 5/k ) and ( b^2 = 1 ).Wait, hold on. Actually, in the standard form, the denominators under ( x^2 ) and ( y^2 ) are ( a^2 ) and ( b^2 ). So, in this case, ( a^2 = 5/k ) and ( b^2 = 1 ). But I need to figure out whether the major axis is along the x-axis or the y-axis. That depends on which denominator is larger.So, if ( a^2 > b^2 ), then the major axis is along the x-axis, and if ( b^2 > a^2 ), then it's along the y-axis. Let me see. Since ( b^2 = 1 ), and ( a^2 = 5/k ), we need to compare ( 5/k ) and 1.But wait, the focus is given as ( (2, 0) ), which is on the x-axis. That suggests that the major axis is along the x-axis because the foci are located along the major axis. Therefore, ( a^2 > b^2 ), so ( 5/k > 1 ). That implies that ( 5/k > 1 ), so ( k < 5 ). Hmm, okay, that gives me a condition on ( k ).Now, I remember that for an ellipse, the distance from the center to each focus is given by ( c ), where ( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 ). Since the center of the ellipse is at the origin (because the equation is in terms of ( x^2 ) and ( y^2 ) without any shifts), the foci are located at ( (pm c, 0) ) if the major axis is along the x-axis.Given that one of the foci is ( (2, 0) ), that means ( c = 2 ). So, ( c^2 = 4 ). Therefore, ( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 ) becomes ( 4 = a^2 - b^2 ).From earlier, I have ( a^2 = 5/k ) and ( b^2 = 1 ). Plugging these into the equation, we get:( 4 = frac{5}{k} - 1 )Let me solve for ( k ). First, add 1 to both sides:( 4 + 1 = frac{5}{k} )So, ( 5 = frac{5}{k} )Then, multiply both sides by ( k ):( 5k = 5 )Divide both sides by 5:( k = 1 )Wait, so is ( k = 1 )? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the equation ( kx^2 + 5y^2 = 5 ), dividing by 5 gives ( frac{x^2}{5/k} + frac{y^2}{1} = 1 ). So, ( a^2 = 5/k ) and ( b^2 = 1 ). Since the focus is at ( (2, 0) ), the major axis is along the x-axis, so ( a^2 > b^2 ). Therefore, ( 5/k > 1 ), meaning ( k < 5 ). Then, using ( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 ), with ( c = 2 ), we have ( 4 = 5/k - 1 ). Solving that gives ( 5/k = 5 ), so ( k = 1 ). That seems consistent.But just to be thorough, let me plug ( k = 1 ) back into the original equation and see if it makes sense.If ( k = 1 ), the equation becomes ( x^2 + 5y^2 = 5 ). Dividing by 5, we get ( frac{x^2}{5} + frac{y^2}{1} = 1 ). So, ( a^2 = 5 ) and ( b^2 = 1 ). Then, ( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 = 5 - 1 = 4 ), so ( c = 2 ). That means the foci are at ( (pm 2, 0) ), which matches the given focus ( (2, 0) ). So, yes, ( k = 1 ) is correct.Wait, but hold on a second. If ( a^2 = 5/k ), and ( a^2 = 5 ) when ( k = 1 ), that makes sense because ( 5/k = 5/1 = 5 ). So, all the steps check out.I think I got it right. So, the value of ( k ) is 1.**Final Answer**The value of ( k ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"The perimeters of a certain equilateral triangle and a regular hexagon are the same. What is the ratio of their areas?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: The perimeters of a certain equilateral triangle and a regular hexagon are the same. I need to find the ratio of their areas. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that both an equilateral triangle and a regular hexagon have all their sides equal. So, if their perimeters are the same, the total length around both shapes is equal. That means if I can express the side lengths in terms of each other, I can then find their areas.Let me denote the side length of the equilateral triangle as 'a' and the side length of the regular hexagon as 'b'. Since both perimeters are the same, I can write an equation for that.The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 3a, because it has three sides each of length 'a'. Similarly, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is 6b, because it has six sides each of length 'b'. So, setting them equal:3a = 6bHmm, that simplifies to a = 2b. So, the side length of the triangle is twice that of the hexagon. That makes sense because the triangle has fewer sides, so each side has to be longer to make the same total perimeter.Now, I need to find the areas of both shapes. Let me recall the formulas for their areas.For an equilateral triangle, the area is given by:Area_triangle = (√3 / 4) * a²And for a regular hexagon, the area is given by:Area_hexagon = (3√3 / 2) * b²Wait, let me make sure I remember that correctly. A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side length 'b'. So, the area should be six times the area of one such triangle. The area of one equilateral triangle is (√3 / 4) * b², so multiplying by six gives:Area_hexagon = 6 * (√3 / 4) * b² = (3√3 / 2) * b²Yes, that seems right.So, now I have expressions for both areas in terms of 'a' and 'b'. But since I know that a = 2b, maybe I can express both areas in terms of one variable, say 'b', so that I can find the ratio.Let me substitute a = 2b into the area of the triangle:Area_triangle = (√3 / 4) * (2b)² = (√3 / 4) * 4b² = √3 * b²So, the area of the triangle is √3 * b².And the area of the hexagon is (3√3 / 2) * b².Now, to find the ratio of their areas, I can divide the area of the triangle by the area of the hexagon.Ratio = Area_triangle / Area_hexagon = (√3 * b²) / ( (3√3 / 2) * b² )Hmm, let's simplify this. First, the b² terms cancel out, which is good because the ratio shouldn't depend on the actual size.So, Ratio = (√3) / (3√3 / 2)Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so:Ratio = √3 * (2 / 3√3) = (2√3) / (3√3)Now, the √3 in the numerator and denominator cancels out:Ratio = 2 / 3Wait, so the ratio of the areas is 2/3? That is, the area of the triangle is two-thirds the area of the hexagon?But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because a hexagon usually has a larger area than a triangle with the same perimeter. Let me double-check my calculations.Starting again:Perimeter of triangle: 3a = 6b => a = 2b.Area of triangle: (√3 / 4) * a² = (√3 / 4) * (2b)² = (√3 / 4) * 4b² = √3 * b².Area of hexagon: (3√3 / 2) * b².So, the ratio is √3 * b² divided by (3√3 / 2) * b².Which is (√3 / (3√3 / 2)) = (√3 * 2) / (3√3) = (2√3) / (3√3) = 2/3.Yes, that seems correct. So, the ratio is 2/3.Wait, but another way to think about it is that a regular hexagon is more efficient in area per perimeter than a triangle. So, for the same perimeter, the hexagon should have a larger area, which matches the ratio of 2/3, meaning the triangle is smaller in area compared to the hexagon.Alternatively, if I think about the area formulas, since the hexagon is made up of six equilateral triangles each of side length 'b', and the triangle in question has side length '2b', so each of its sides is twice as long.But the area of a triangle scales with the square of the side length. So, the area of the triangle with side '2b' would be (√3 / 4) * (2b)^2 = √3 * b², as I had before.Meanwhile, the hexagon is six times the area of a triangle with side length 'b', which is 6*(√3 / 4)*b² = (3√3 / 2)*b².So, the ratio is indeed √3 * b² divided by (3√3 / 2)*b², which simplifies to 2/3.Therefore, the ratio of the area of the equilateral triangle to the area of the regular hexagon is 2:3.Wait, hold on, 2/3 is the ratio of the triangle's area to the hexagon's area. So, it's 2:3.But just to make sure, let me consider plugging in actual numbers.Suppose the perimeter is 12 units.Then, for the triangle: each side is 12 / 3 = 4 units.Area of triangle: (√3 / 4) * 4² = (√3 / 4) * 16 = 4√3.For the hexagon: each side is 12 / 6 = 2 units.Area of hexagon: (3√3 / 2) * 2² = (3√3 / 2) * 4 = 6√3.So, the ratio of triangle area to hexagon area is 4√3 / 6√3 = 4/6 = 2/3.Yep, that checks out. So, the ratio is 2/3.Therefore, the ratio of their areas is 2:3.**Final Answer**The ratio of the areas of the equilateral triangle to the regular hexagon is boxed{dfrac{2}{3}}."},{"question":"If frac {a}{1-i} = 1-bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, then a+b= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: (a)/(1 - i) equals 1 - b i. Hmm, a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit. I need to find a + b. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when you have a complex number in the denominator, it's often helpful to multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to simplify it. The complex conjugate of 1 - i is 1 + i. So, maybe I should multiply both the numerator and denominator by 1 + i.Let me write that down. So, (a)/(1 - i) multiplied by (1 + i)/(1 + i) would give me a*(1 + i) in the numerator and (1 - i)(1 + i) in the denominator. Let me compute the denominator first because that might simplify things.Calculating (1 - i)(1 + i): that's a difference of squares, right? So, it should be 1^2 - (i)^2. Which is 1 - (-1) because i squared is -1. So, 1 - (-1) is 1 + 1, which is 2. Okay, so the denominator simplifies to 2.So now, the left side of the equation becomes [a*(1 + i)] / 2. So, the equation now is [a*(1 + i)] / 2 = 1 - b i.Hmm, so I have a complex number on the left side and a complex number on the right side. Since a and b are real numbers, the real parts and the imaginary parts must be equal on both sides. That is, the real part of the left side must equal the real part of the right side, and the imaginary part of the left side must equal the imaginary part of the right side.Let me write that out. The left side is [a*(1 + i)] / 2. Let's distribute the a: that becomes (a/2) + (a/2)i. So, the real part is a/2 and the imaginary part is a/2.On the right side, the equation is 1 - b i. So, the real part is 1 and the imaginary part is -b.Therefore, setting the real parts equal: a/2 = 1. And setting the imaginary parts equal: a/2 = -b.So, from the first equation, a/2 = 1, so multiplying both sides by 2, we get a = 2.Then, from the second equation, a/2 = -b. Since we found a = 2, plug that in: 2/2 = -b, which simplifies to 1 = -b. Therefore, b = -1.So, a is 2 and b is -1. Therefore, a + b is 2 + (-1) which is 1.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with (a)/(1 - i) = 1 - b i.Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i):a*(1 + i) / [(1 - i)(1 + i)] = 1 - b i.Denominator: 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.So, left side is [a(1 + i)] / 2.Which is (a/2) + (a/2)i.Set equal to 1 - b i.Therefore, equate real parts: a/2 = 1 => a = 2.Equate imaginary parts: a/2 = -b => 2/2 = -b => 1 = -b => b = -1.So, a + b = 2 + (-1) = 1.Hmm, seems consistent. Let me plug the values back into the original equation to verify.Left side: a/(1 - i) = 2/(1 - i).Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i): 2*(1 + i)/[(1 - i)(1 + i)] = 2*(1 + i)/2 = (1 + i).Right side: 1 - b i = 1 - (-1)i = 1 + i.Yes, both sides are equal. So, my solution is correct.Therefore, a + b is 1.**Final Answer**The value of (a + b) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"In the diagram, (triangle ABC) is right-angled at (C).

Let me try to visualize it first. It says that triangle ABC is right-angled at C. So, I can imagine triangle ABC with a right angle at point C. That means sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse.Now, the problem mentions points D, BD, and DC. Hmm, BD is 2x and DC is x. So, point D must be somewhere on side BC because BD and DC are segments of BC. So, BC is divided into two parts: BD = 2x and DC = x. Therefore, the total length of BC is BD + DC = 2x + x = 3x.Alright, so BC = 3x. Got that.Next, it says that angle ADC is twice angle ABC. Let me denote angle ABC as θ. So, angle ADC = 2θ. I need to relate these angles somehow.Since triangle ABC is right-angled at C, angle ABC is one of the acute angles. Let me denote angle ABC as θ, so angle BAC would be 90° - θ.Now, angle ADC is 2θ. Let me see where point D is. Since D is on BC, and BD = 2x, DC = x, so D divides BC into a ratio of 2:1.I think I can use trigonometry here. Maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangles.First, let me consider triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, we know DC = x, angle ADC = 2θ, and we might be able to relate sides and angles.But wait, I don't know much about triangle ADC yet. Maybe I should consider triangle ABC first.In triangle ABC, since it's right-angled at C, we can write the Pythagorean theorem: AB² = AC² + BC².We know BC = 3x, but we don't know AC. Let me denote AC as some variable, say, y. So, AC = y, BC = 3x, and AB = sqrt(y² + (3x)²). But we need to find AB in terms of x, so maybe we can find y in terms of x.Alternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric ratios. In triangle ABC, tan(theta) = AC / BC. Wait, no, in triangle ABC, angle at B is theta, so tan(theta) = AC / BC. Wait, actually, in triangle ABC, angle at B is theta, so opposite side is AC, adjacent side is BC. So, tan(theta) = AC / BC = y / (3x). So, tan(theta) = y / (3x).Now, let's look at triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, angle at D is 2 theta, side DC is x, and side AC is y. Maybe I can use the Law of Sines here.In triangle ADC, Law of Sines says that AC / sin(angle ADC) = DC / sin(angle A). Wait, angle at A is angle BAC, which is 90° - theta. So, angle A is 90° - theta.So, applying Law of Sines to triangle ADC:AC / sin(angle ADC) = DC / sin(angle A)So, y / sin(2θ) = x / sin(90° - θ)Simplify sin(90° - θ) as cos(theta). So,y / sin(2θ) = x / cos(theta)Therefore, y = x * sin(2θ) / cos(theta)But sin(2θ) is 2 sin(theta) cos(theta), so:y = x * (2 sin(theta) cos(theta)) / cos(theta) = 2x sin(theta)So, y = 2x sin(theta)But earlier, from triangle ABC, we had tan(theta) = y / (3x). So, tan(theta) = (2x sin(theta)) / (3x) = (2 sin(theta)) / 3So, tan(theta) = (2 sin(theta)) / 3But tan(theta) is sin(theta)/cos(theta), so:sin(theta)/cos(theta) = (2 sin(theta))/3Assuming sin(theta) ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by sin(theta):1/cos(theta) = 2/3So, cos(theta) = 3/2Wait, that can't be. Cosine of an angle can't be more than 1. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.Let me go back and check my steps.Starting again, in triangle ABC, angle at B is theta, so tan(theta) = AC / BC = y / (3x). So, tan(theta) = y / (3x). That seems correct.In triangle ADC, angle at D is 2 theta, side DC is x, side AC is y. Using Law of Sines:AC / sin(angle ADC) = DC / sin(angle A)So, y / sin(2 theta) = x / sin(90° - theta)Which is y / sin(2 theta) = x / cos(theta)So, y = x * sin(2 theta) / cos(theta)Which is y = x * 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) / cos(theta) = 2x sin(theta). So, that seems correct.Then, from triangle ABC, tan(theta) = y / (3x) = (2x sin(theta)) / (3x) = (2 sin(theta))/3.So, tan(theta) = (2 sin(theta))/3.But tan(theta) is sin(theta)/cos(theta), so:sin(theta)/cos(theta) = (2 sin(theta))/3Assuming sin(theta) ≠ 0, divide both sides by sin(theta):1/cos(theta) = 2/3So, cos(theta) = 3/2But that's impossible because cosine can't exceed 1. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, maybe I applied the Law of Sines incorrectly in triangle ADC. Let me double-check.In triangle ADC, the angles are:- At D: 2 theta- At C: ?- At A: 90° - thetaWait, actually, in triangle ADC, angle at C is not necessarily the same as in triangle ABC. Wait, no, point C is the same, so angle at C in triangle ADC is still 90°, right? Wait, no, triangle ADC is not necessarily right-angled. Wait, hold on.Wait, triangle ABC is right-angled at C, but triangle ADC is a different triangle. So, angle at C in triangle ADC is the same as angle at C in triangle ABC, which is 90°, right? Because point D is on BC, so angle at C is still 90°. So, triangle ADC has angle at C of 90°, angle at D of 2 theta, and angle at A of 90° - 2 theta?Wait, no, that can't be because in triangle ABC, angle at A is 90° - theta. So, in triangle ADC, angle at A is still 90° - theta, right? Because point D is on BC, so angle at A is the same as in triangle ABC.Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at A is 90° - theta because it's a right-angled triangle. But in triangle ADC, angle at A is different because D is a different point.Wait, maybe I'm confusing the angles. Let me try to clarify.In triangle ABC, right-angled at C, so angles are:- At C: 90°- At B: theta- At A: 90° - thetaIn triangle ADC, which is also a triangle with points A, D, C. So, angle at C is still 90°, because it's the same point C as in triangle ABC. So, triangle ADC is also right-angled at C. Wait, is that correct?Wait, no, because D is on BC, so triangle ADC is not necessarily right-angled. Wait, actually, point D is on BC, so AC is still a side, but DC is another side, and AD is the third side. So, triangle ADC is not right-angled unless specified.Wait, but in triangle ABC, angle at C is 90°, but in triangle ADC, angle at C is still part of the original right angle. So, maybe triangle ADC is also right-angled at C? Hmm, that's possible.Wait, if D is on BC, then AC is perpendicular to BC, so AC is perpendicular to CD as well. So, triangle ADC is right-angled at C. So, angle at C is 90°, angle at D is 2 theta, and angle at A is 90° - 2 theta.Wait, but in triangle ABC, angle at A is 90° - theta. So, if triangle ADC has angle at A as 90° - 2 theta, that would mean that 90° - 2 theta is different from 90° - theta, which is the angle at A in triangle ABC. So, that suggests that angle at A is different in triangle ADC, which is not possible because point A is the same in both triangles.Wait, that's a contradiction. So, maybe triangle ADC is not right-angled at C. Hmm, that complicates things.Wait, maybe I need to consider triangle ABD instead. But the problem mentions angle ADC, so it's definitely triangle ADC.Wait, perhaps I need to use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the points.Let me place point C at (0, 0), since it's the right angle. Then, point B can be at (0, 3x) because BC = 3x. Point A can be at (y, 0), since AC is along the x-axis.So, coordinates:- C: (0, 0)- B: (0, 3x)- A: (y, 0)Point D is on BC, which goes from (0, 3x) to (0, 0). Since BD = 2x and DC = x, point D divides BC into BD:DC = 2:1. So, starting from B at (0, 3x), moving down 2x units, so D is at (0, 3x - 2x) = (0, x). Wait, no, because BD is 2x and DC is x, so from B to D is 2x, and from D to C is x. So, total BC is 3x.So, coordinates of D: Since BC is from (0, 3x) to (0, 0), moving down 2x from B, so D is at (0, 3x - 2x) = (0, x). So, D is at (0, x).So, coordinates:- A: (y, 0)- B: (0, 3x)- C: (0, 0)- D: (0, x)Now, angle ADC is 2 theta, where theta is angle ABC.First, let's find theta, which is angle ABC. In triangle ABC, angle at B is theta, so tan(theta) = AC / BC = y / (3x).So, tan(theta) = y / (3x).Now, angle ADC is 2 theta. Let's find angle ADC in terms of coordinates.Point D is at (0, x), point A is at (y, 0), point C is at (0, 0).So, triangle ADC has points A(y, 0), D(0, x), C(0, 0).So, angle at D is angle ADC. Let's compute angle ADC.To find angle ADC, we can compute the angle between vectors DA and DC.Vector DA is from D to A: (y - 0, 0 - x) = (y, -x)Vector DC is from D to C: (0 - 0, 0 - x) = (0, -x)So, angle between vectors DA and DC is angle ADC.We can use the dot product formula:cos(angle ADC) = (DA · DC) / (|DA| |DC|)Compute DA · DC: (y)(0) + (-x)(-x) = 0 + x² = x²|DA| = sqrt(y² + x²)|DC| = sqrt(0² + (-x)²) = xSo,cos(angle ADC) = x² / (sqrt(y² + x²) * x) = x / sqrt(y² + x²)But angle ADC is 2 theta, so:cos(2 theta) = x / sqrt(y² + x²)But we also know that tan(theta) = y / (3x). Let's express cos(2 theta) in terms of tan(theta).We know that cos(2 theta) = (1 - tan²(theta)) / (1 + tan²(theta))Since tan(theta) = y / (3x), tan²(theta) = y² / (9x²)So,cos(2 theta) = (1 - y² / (9x²)) / (1 + y² / (9x²)) = ( (9x² - y²) / (9x²) ) / ( (9x² + y²) / (9x²) ) = (9x² - y²) / (9x² + y²)So, from earlier, we have:cos(2 theta) = x / sqrt(y² + x²)Therefore,(9x² - y²) / (9x² + y²) = x / sqrt(y² + x²)Let me write this equation:(9x² - y²) / (9x² + y²) = x / sqrt(y² + x²)Let me denote sqrt(y² + x²) as z for simplicity. So, z = sqrt(y² + x²). Then, z² = y² + x².So, equation becomes:(9x² - y²) / (9x² + y²) = x / zBut z² = y² + x², so z = sqrt(y² + x²)Let me cross-multiply:(9x² - y²) * z = x * (9x² + y²)But z = sqrt(y² + x²), so:(9x² - y²) * sqrt(y² + x²) = x * (9x² + y²)This looks complicated, but maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square root.So, square both sides:(9x² - y²)² * (y² + x²) = x² * (9x² + y²)²Let me expand both sides.First, left side:(9x² - y²)² = (81x⁴ - 18x² y² + y⁴)Multiply by (y² + x²):(81x⁴ - 18x² y² + y⁴)(y² + x²) = 81x⁴ y² + 81x⁶ - 18x² y⁴ - 18x⁴ y² + y⁶ + y⁴ x²Simplify term by term:81x⁴ y² + 81x⁶ - 18x² y⁴ - 18x⁴ y² + y⁶ + x² y⁴Combine like terms:81x⁶ + (81x⁴ y² - 18x⁴ y²) + (-18x² y⁴ + x² y⁴) + y⁶Which is:81x⁶ + 63x⁴ y² - 17x² y⁴ + y⁶Now, the right side:x² * (9x² + y²)²First, expand (9x² + y²)² = 81x⁴ + 18x² y² + y⁴Multiply by x²:81x⁶ + 18x⁴ y² + x² y⁴So, right side is 81x⁶ + 18x⁴ y² + x² y⁴Now, set left side equal to right side:81x⁶ + 63x⁴ y² - 17x² y⁴ + y⁶ = 81x⁶ + 18x⁴ y² + x² y⁴Subtract right side from both sides:(81x⁶ - 81x⁶) + (63x⁴ y² - 18x⁴ y²) + (-17x² y⁴ - x² y⁴) + y⁶ = 0Simplify:0 + 45x⁴ y² - 18x² y⁴ + y⁶ = 0So,45x⁴ y² - 18x² y⁴ + y⁶ = 0Let me factor out y²:y² (45x⁴ - 18x² y² + y⁴) = 0Since y is a length, y ≠ 0, so:45x⁴ - 18x² y² + y⁴ = 0Let me let z = y². Then, equation becomes:45x⁴ - 18x² z + z² = 0This is a quadratic in z:z² - 18x² z + 45x⁴ = 0Let me solve for z using quadratic formula:z = [18x² ± sqrt( (18x²)^2 - 4*1*45x⁴ ) ] / 2Compute discriminant:(18x²)^2 - 4*1*45x⁴ = 324x⁴ - 180x⁴ = 144x⁴So,z = [18x² ± sqrt(144x⁴)] / 2 = [18x² ± 12x²] / 2So,z = (18x² + 12x²)/2 = 30x² / 2 = 15x²orz = (18x² - 12x²)/2 = 6x² / 2 = 3x²So, z = 15x² or z = 3x²But z = y², so y² = 15x² or y² = 3x²Thus, y = sqrt(15)x or y = sqrt(3)xNow, let's check which one is valid.From earlier, we had tan(theta) = y / (3x). So, if y = sqrt(15)x, then tan(theta) = sqrt(15)/3 = sqrt(15)/3 ≈ 1.291If y = sqrt(3)x, then tan(theta) = sqrt(3)/3 ≈ 0.577But we also had from triangle ADC:cos(2 theta) = x / sqrt(y² + x²)Let's compute cos(2 theta) for both cases.Case 1: y = sqrt(15)xThen, sqrt(y² + x²) = sqrt(15x² + x²) = sqrt(16x²) = 4xSo, cos(2 theta) = x / (4x) = 1/4But cos(2 theta) = 1/4 implies that 2 theta = arccos(1/4) ≈ 75.52°, so theta ≈ 37.76°But tan(theta) = sqrt(15)/3 ≈ 1.291, which is tan(52.23°), which is not equal to 37.76°. So, this is a contradiction.Case 2: y = sqrt(3)xThen, sqrt(y² + x²) = sqrt(3x² + x²) = sqrt(4x²) = 2xSo, cos(2 theta) = x / (2x) = 1/2Thus, cos(2 theta) = 1/2 implies that 2 theta = 60°, so theta = 30°Check tan(theta) = tan(30°) = 1/sqrt(3) ≈ 0.577, which matches y / (3x) = sqrt(3)x / (3x) = sqrt(3)/3 ≈ 0.577So, this is consistent.Therefore, y = sqrt(3)xSo, AC = y = sqrt(3)xNow, in triangle ABC, AB² = AC² + BC² = (sqrt(3)x)^2 + (3x)^2 = 3x² + 9x² = 12x²Therefore, AB = sqrt(12x²) = 2 sqrt(3) xSo, the length of AB is 2 sqrt(3) x, which corresponds to option (C).**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"The centers of two circles are 41 inches apart.

Their centers are 41 inches apart. The smaller circle has a radius of 4 inches, and the larger one has a radius of 5 inches. I need to find the length of the common internal tangent. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that a common internal tangent is a line that touches both circles and lies between them, meaning the tangent doesn't cross the line segment connecting their centers. I think the formula for the length of the common internal tangent between two circles is something like the square root of the distance between centers squared minus the sum of the radii squared. Wait, no, that might be for the external tangent. Let me double-check.Actually, for the internal tangent, since the tangent lines are between the circles, the formula should involve the difference of the radii, right? Or maybe it's the sum? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me visualize this.Imagine two circles, one smaller and one larger, with their centers 41 inches apart. The internal tangent would touch the smaller circle on one side and the larger circle on the other side, and the tangent line would be between them. So, if I draw the two radii to the points of tangency, those radii would be perpendicular to the tangent line. That means those radii are parallel to each other because they're both perpendicular to the same line.So, if I connect the centers of the two circles, that's a line of 41 inches. Then, if I draw the two radii to the tangent points, those are 4 inches and 5 inches respectively. Since these radii are parallel, the triangle formed by the centers and the points of tangency is a trapezoid. Wait, actually, if I connect the centers and then draw the radii, I can form a right triangle by shifting one of the radii.Let me try to draw this mentally. If I have the two centers, O1 and O2, with O1O2 = 41 inches. The radii are r1 = 4 inches and r2 = 5 inches. The internal tangent will touch the smaller circle at point T1 and the larger circle at point T2. The lines O1T1 and O2T2 are both perpendicular to the tangent line, so they are parallel.If I connect O1 to O2, that's 41 inches. Then, if I draw a line from O2 parallel to T2O2, which is the radius, it will meet the line O1T1 at some point. Wait, maybe I should think of it as a right triangle where the sides are the distance between centers, the difference in radii, and the length of the tangent.Wait, actually, I think the formula for the length of the internal tangent is sqrt(d^2 - (r1 + r2)^2), but no, that can't be right because if the circles are too far apart, the tangent length would be imaginary. Wait, no, maybe it's sqrt(d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2). Hmm, let me think.Wait, for external tangent, the formula is sqrt(d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2), and for internal tangent, it's sqrt(d^2 - (r1 + r2)^2). But wait, if d is the distance between centers, then for internal tangent, the formula should involve the sum of radii because the tangent is between them.But hold on, if the distance between centers is 41 inches, and the radii are 4 and 5, so the sum is 9. So, 41 squared is 1681, and 9 squared is 81. So, 1681 - 81 is 1600, and sqrt(1600) is 40. So, is the length of the internal tangent 40 inches? Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the formulas.Wait, actually, now I'm getting confused because I thought internal tangent uses the sum, but sometimes I get mixed up. Let me think of the external tangent. For external tangent, the formula is sqrt(d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2). So, if d is 41, r1 is 4, r2 is 5, so the difference is 1. So, 41 squared is 1681, 1 squared is 1, so 1681 - 1 is 1680, sqrt(1680) is approximately 41, which is one of the options, but that's for external tangent.Wait, but the question is about internal tangent, so maybe I was right the first time. Let me think again.If I have two circles, the internal tangent would form a right triangle where one leg is the length of the tangent, another leg is the sum of the radii, and the hypotenuse is the distance between centers. So, the formula is length = sqrt(d^2 - (r1 + r2)^2). So, in this case, that would be sqrt(41^2 - (4 + 5)^2) = sqrt(1681 - 81) = sqrt(1600) = 40. So, 40 inches. Hmm, that seems to make sense.Wait, but let me visualize it again. If I have two circles, centers 41 apart, radii 4 and 5. The internal tangent would be the line that just touches both circles between them. If I connect the centers, that's 41. Then, if I draw the tangent line, and then draw the radii to the tangent points, those radii are both perpendicular to the tangent, so they are parallel. So, the distance between the centers can be thought of as the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the length of the tangent, and the other leg is the sum of the radii.Wait, no, actually, if the radii are parallel, then the line connecting the centers is the hypotenuse, and the difference in radii would be one leg, and the length of the tangent would be the other leg. Wait, no, that might be for external tangent.Wait, maybe I should think of it as the line connecting the centers, and then from the center of the smaller circle, draw a radius to the tangent point, and from the center of the larger circle, draw a radius to its tangent point. These two radii are both perpendicular to the tangent line, so they are parallel. Therefore, the distance between the centers can be broken down into two parts: the length of the tangent line, and the line connecting the two radii endpoints.Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as a right triangle where one side is the length of the tangent, another side is the difference in radii, and the hypotenuse is the distance between centers. But no, that would be for external tangent.Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to recall the exact formula.I think the formula for the length of the common internal tangent is sqrt(d^2 - (r1 + r2)^2). So, in this case, sqrt(41^2 - (4 + 5)^2) = sqrt(1681 - 81) = sqrt(1600) = 40. So, that would be 40 inches, which is option E.But wait, let me make sure. I think the formula for internal tangent is sqrt(d^2 - (r1 + r2)^2), and for external tangent, it's sqrt(d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2). So, since internal tangent is between the circles, the formula subtracts the square of the sum of radii, whereas external tangent subtracts the square of the difference.So, in this case, since we're dealing with internal tangent, it's sqrt(41^2 - (4 + 5)^2) = sqrt(1681 - 81) = sqrt(1600) = 40. So, 40 inches, which is option E.But wait, let me think again. If the distance between centers is 41, and the sum of radii is 9, then 41 is much larger than 9, so the tangent should be a real number, which it is, 40. So, that seems reasonable.Alternatively, if I think about the external tangent, which would be sqrt(41^2 - (5 - 4)^2) = sqrt(1681 - 1) = sqrt(1680) ≈ 41, which is also one of the options, but that's for external tangent, which isn't what the question is asking.So, yeah, I think the answer is 40 inches, which is option E.Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning. If I have two circles, centers 41 apart, radii 4 and 5. The internal tangent would form a right triangle with sides equal to the length of the tangent, the sum of the radii, and the distance between centers. So, by Pythagoras, length^2 + (r1 + r2)^2 = d^2. So, length = sqrt(d^2 - (r1 + r2)^2). Plugging in, sqrt(41^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(1681 - 81) = sqrt(1600) = 40. So, that's consistent.Alternatively, if I think about the external tangent, it's sqrt(d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2). So, in this case, sqrt(41^2 - 1^2) = sqrt(1680) ≈ 41, which is close to 41, but not exactly. So, that's why 40 is the correct answer for internal tangent.Therefore, I think the answer is E, 40 inches.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"Form a four-digit number with no repeated digits using the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, where exactly one even digit is sandwiched between two odd digits. The number of such four-digit numbers is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to form a four-digit number using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 without repeating any digits. The condition is that exactly one even digit is sandwiched between two odd digits. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, let me list out the digits I have: 1, 2, 3, 4. Among these, the odd digits are 1 and 3, and the even digits are 2 and 4. So, I have two odd and two even digits to work with.The problem specifies that exactly one even digit is sandwiched between two odd digits. That means in the four-digit number, there should be a position where an even digit is flanked by two odd digits. Also, since we're using all four digits without repetition, the other even digit must be placed somewhere else, not sandwiched between two odds.Let me visualize the four-digit number as four positions: _ _ _ _. Each position will be occupied by one of the digits 1, 2, 3, or 4, with no repeats.Now, the key is to figure out where the even digits can be placed such that exactly one of them is between two odd digits. Let's denote the positions as Position 1, Position 2, Position 3, and Position 4.I think it might help to consider the possible positions where an even digit can be sandwiched between two odd digits. In a four-digit number, the only positions where a digit can be sandwiched between two others are Positions 2 and 3. So, if an even digit is in Position 2, it must be between Position 1 and Position 3. Similarly, if it's in Position 3, it's between Position 2 and Position 4.Therefore, the sandwiched even digit can be in either Position 2 or Position 3. Let's consider these two cases separately.**Case 1: Even digit is in Position 2.**So, the structure would be: [Odd] [Even] [Odd] [Even or Odd]. Wait, but we have only two even digits: 2 and 4. Since we're using each digit once, if we place one even digit in Position 2, the other even digit has to go somewhere else. But in this case, the structure would be:Position 1: Odd (either 1 or 3)Position 2: Even (either 2 or 4)Position 3: Odd (the remaining odd digit)Position 4: The remaining digit, which is the other even digit.Wait, but in this case, the even digit in Position 4 is not sandwiched between two odds because it's at the end. So, this satisfies the condition of exactly one even digit being sandwiched between two odds.Similarly, **Case 2: Even digit is in Position 3.**The structure would be: [Odd] [Even] [Even] [Odd]. Wait, hold on. If Position 3 is even, then Position 2 and Position 4 must be odd for it to be sandwiched. But we only have two odd digits, so Position 2 and Position 4 would both have to be odd, but we only have two odd digits: 1 and 3. So, let's see:Position 1: OddPosition 2: OddPosition 3: EvenPosition 4: OddWait, no, that's not possible because we only have two odd digits. So, if Positions 1, 2, and 4 are all odd, that would require three odd digits, but we only have two. So, that's not feasible. Therefore, if the even digit is in Position 3, it can't be sandwiched between two odds because we don't have enough odd digits.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine.If the even digit is in Position 3, then to be sandwiched between two odds, Positions 2 and 4 must be odd. But we have only two odd digits: 1 and 3. So, if Position 2 is odd and Position 4 is odd, that would require two different odd digits, which we have. Then, Position 1 would have to be the remaining digit, which is even. So, the structure would be:Position 1: EvenPosition 2: OddPosition 3: EvenPosition 4: OddBut in this case, the even digit in Position 3 is sandwiched between two odds (Position 2 and 4). However, the even digit in Position 1 is not sandwiched because it's at the beginning. So, this structure also satisfies the condition of exactly one even digit being sandwiched between two odds.Wait, so in this case, we have two sandwiched even digits? No, only the even digit in Position 3 is sandwiched. The even digit in Position 1 is not sandwiched because it's at the start. So, actually, only one even digit is sandwiched. So, this is also a valid case.Therefore, both Case 1 and Case 2 are possible. So, let me correct my earlier thought. Both Position 2 and Position 3 can have the sandwiched even digit, each leading to a different structure.So, now, let's formalize this.**Case 1: Even digit in Position 2 (sandwiched between Positions 1 and 3).**Structure:- Position 1: Odd (either 1 or 3)- Position 2: Even (either 2 or 4)- Position 3: Odd (the remaining odd digit)- Position 4: The remaining digit (which is the other even digit)So, let's compute the number of possibilities here.First, choose the digit for Position 1: 2 choices (1 or 3).Then, choose the digit for Position 2: 2 choices (2 or 4).Position 3 is determined once we've chosen Position 1, since it has to be the other odd digit.Position 4 is determined once we've chosen Position 2, since it has to be the other even digit.Therefore, the number of numbers in this case is 2 (for Position 1) * 2 (for Position 2) = 4.Wait, let me verify:Suppose Position 1 is 1, Position 2 is 2, then Position 3 is 3, Position 4 is 4. So, the number is 1234.Similarly, Position 1 is 1, Position 2 is 4, then Position 3 is 3, Position 4 is 2. So, the number is 1432.Similarly, Position 1 is 3, Position 2 is 2, then Position 3 is 1, Position 4 is 4. So, the number is 3214.Position 1 is 3, Position 2 is 4, then Position 3 is 1, Position 4 is 2. So, the number is 3412.So, that's 4 numbers.**Case 2: Even digit in Position 3 (sandwiched between Positions 2 and 4).**Structure:- Position 1: Even (either 2 or 4)- Position 2: Odd (either 1 or 3)- Position 3: Even (the remaining even digit)- Position 4: Odd (the remaining odd digit)So, similar to Case 1, let's compute the number of possibilities.First, choose the digit for Position 1: 2 choices (2 or 4).Then, choose the digit for Position 2: 2 choices (1 or 3).Position 3 is determined once we've chosen Position 1, since it has to be the other even digit.Position 4 is determined once we've chosen Position 2, since it has to be the other odd digit.Therefore, the number of numbers in this case is 2 (for Position 1) * 2 (for Position 2) = 4.Let me verify with examples:Position 1 is 2, Position 2 is 1, then Position 3 is 4, Position 4 is 3. So, the number is 2143.Position 1 is 2, Position 2 is 3, then Position 3 is 4, Position 4 is 1. So, the number is 2341.Position 1 is 4, Position 2 is 1, then Position 3 is 2, Position 4 is 3. So, the number is 4123.Position 1 is 4, Position 2 is 3, then Position 3 is 2, Position 4 is 1. So, the number is 4321.So, that's another 4 numbers.Therefore, combining both cases, the total number of four-digit numbers is 4 (from Case 1) + 4 (from Case 2) = 8.Wait, hold on. Let me think again. Is that all?Wait, are there any other cases where an even digit is sandwiched between two odds? For example, could both even digits be sandwiched between odds? But in a four-digit number, if both even digits are sandwiched, that would require each even digit to be between two odds, but we only have two odd digits. So, if both even digits are sandwiched, each would need two odds, which would require four odd digits in total, but we only have two. Therefore, it's impossible for both even digits to be sandwiched. So, only one even digit can be sandwiched, which is exactly what the problem states: exactly one even digit is sandwiched between two odd digits.Therefore, the two cases we considered (even digit in Position 2 and even digit in Position 3) cover all possibilities, and each contributes 4 numbers, totaling 8.But wait, let me think again. Are there any overlaps or duplicates in these cases? For example, could a number be counted in both Case 1 and Case 2? Let's see.Looking at the examples from Case 1: 1234, 1432, 3214, 3412.From Case 2: 2143, 2341, 4123, 4321.None of these numbers are the same, so there's no overlap. Therefore, adding them is correct.But just to be thorough, let me list all possible four-digit numbers with digits 1, 2, 3, 4 without repetition and check which ones satisfy the condition.Total number of four-digit numbers without repetition is 4! = 24. That's manageable.Let me list them:1. 12342. 12433. 13244. 13425. 14236. 14327. 21348. 21439. 231410. 234111. 241312. 243113. 312414. 314215. 321416. 324117. 341218. 342119. 412320. 413221. 421322. 423123. 431224. 4321Now, let's go through each number and check if exactly one even digit is sandwiched between two odd digits.1. 1234: Let's look at each even digit.

Counts.Now, let's count how many numbers satisfy the condition:From the list above, the numbers that satisfy the condition are:1. 12346. 14328. 214310. 234115. 321417. 341219. 412324. 4321That's 8 numbers in total.Wait, so according to my initial calculation, it's 8 numbers, and when I listed all possibilities, I also got 8 numbers. So, that seems consistent.But just to make sure, let me recount the numbers that satisfy the condition:1. 12346. 14328. 214310. 234115. 321417. 341219. 412324. 4321Yes, that's 8 numbers.Therefore, the number of such four-digit numbers is 8.**Final Answer**The number of such four-digit numbers is boxed{8}."},{"question":"Grandpa is twice as strong as Grandma, Grandma is three times as strong as Granddaughter, Granddaughter is four times as strong as Dog, Dog is five times as strong as Cat, Cat is six times as strong as Mouse. Grandpa, Grandma, Granddaughter, Dog, and Cat together with Mouse can pull up the Turnip, but without the Mouse, they cannot. How many Mice are needed to pull up the Turnip by themselves?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about Grandpa, Grandma, Granddaughter, Dog, Cat, and Mouse pulling up a Turnip. It seems like a classic strength comparison problem. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the problem states:- Grandpa is twice as strong as Grandma.- Grandma is three times as strong as Granddaughter.- Granddaughter is four times as strong as Dog.- Dog is five times as strong as Cat.- Cat is six times as strong as Mouse.Then it says that together, Grandpa, Grandma, Granddaughter, Dog, Cat, and Mouse can pull up the Turnip, but without the Mouse, they cannot. The question is, how many Mice are needed to pull up the Turnip by themselves?Alright, so I think the key here is to figure out the relative strengths of each entity and then determine how much strength is needed to pull up the Turnip. Once we know the total strength required, we can figure out how many Mice are needed since we know the strength of one Mouse.Let me assign variables to each entity to make it easier. Let's let the strength of the Mouse be M. Then, according to the problem:- Cat is six times as strong as Mouse, so Cat = 6M.- Dog is five times as strong as Cat, so Dog = 5 * Cat = 5 * 6M = 30M.- Granddaughter is four times as strong as Dog, so Granddaughter = 4 * Dog = 4 * 30M = 120M.- Grandma is three times as strong as Granddaughter, so Grandma = 3 * Granddaughter = 3 * 120M = 360M.- Grandpa is twice as strong as Grandma, so Grandpa = 2 * Grandma = 2 * 360M = 720M.So now, we have all their strengths in terms of M:- Mouse: M- Cat: 6M- Dog: 30M- Granddaughter: 120M- Grandma: 360M- Grandpa: 720MNext, let's calculate the total strength when all of them are pulling together. That would be:Total strength with Mouse = Grandpa + Grandma + Granddaughter + Dog + Cat + Mouse= 720M + 360M + 120M + 30M + 6M + M= Let's add these up step by step.720M + 360M = 1080M1080M + 120M = 1200M1200M + 30M = 1230M1230M + 6M = 1236M1236M + M = 1237MSo together, including the Mouse, their total strength is 1237M.Now, without the Mouse, the total strength would be:Total strength without Mouse = Grandpa + Grandma + Granddaughter + Dog + Cat= 720M + 360M + 120M + 30M + 6M= Let's add these up.720M + 360M = 1080M1080M + 120M = 1200M1200M + 30M = 1230M1230M + 6M = 1236MSo without the Mouse, their total strength is 1236M.The problem states that with the Mouse, they can pull up the Turnip, but without the Mouse, they cannot. That means the Turnip requires more than 1236M of strength but less than or equal to 1237M. Since 1237M is just 1M more than 1236M, it seems like the Turnip requires exactly 1237M of strength. Otherwise, if it required more than 1237M, even with the Mouse, they couldn't pull it up. So, I think the Turnip requires 1237M of strength.Now, the question is, how many Mice are needed to pull up the Turnip by themselves? Since one Mouse is M, we need to find the number of Mice (let's call it x) such that x * M = 1237M.So, x * M = 1237MDividing both sides by M (assuming M ≠ 0, which makes sense because otherwise, no one could pull the Turnip), we get:x = 1237Therefore, 1237 Mice are needed to pull up the Turnip by themselves.Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the Mouse:- Mouse: M- Cat: 6M- Dog: 5 * Cat = 5 * 6M = 30M- Granddaughter: 4 * Dog = 4 * 30M = 120M- Grandma: 3 * Granddaughter = 3 * 120M = 360M- Grandpa: 2 * Grandma = 2 * 360M = 720MAdding them all up with the Mouse:720 + 360 + 120 + 30 + 6 + 1 = 1237Yes, that's correct. So, the total strength needed is 1237M. Therefore, 1237 Mice are needed.But wait, just to make sure, if we have 1237 Mice, each contributing M, the total strength would be 1237M, which is exactly the strength needed. So, yes, that makes sense.Alternatively, if we think about it, without the Mouse, the total is 1236M, which is just one M less than needed. So, adding one Mouse gives the exact amount needed. Therefore, if we need to replace all the others with Mice, we need 1237 Mice.I think that's the correct answer."},{"question":"Compute cos 240^circ.","answer":"To compute (cos 240^circ), I first recognize that (240^circ) is in the third quadrant of the unit circle.In the third quadrant, the cosine values are negative.Next, I determine the reference angle by subtracting (180^circ) from (240^circ), which gives (60^circ).The cosine of (60^circ) is (frac{1}{2}).Since cosine is negative in the third quadrant, (cos 240^circ = -frac{1}{2})."},{"question":"The real part of the complex number frac {5}{1-2i} is __________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the real part of the complex number 5 divided by (1 minus 2i). Hmm, complex numbers can be a bit tricky, especially when they're in the denominator. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when you have a complex number in the denominator, a good strategy is to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate is where you change the sign of the imaginary part. So, in this case, the denominator is 1 minus 2i, so its conjugate should be 1 plus 2i. That makes sense.Alright, so I'll start by writing the expression:5 / (1 - 2i)Now, I need to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1 + 2i). So that would look like:[5 * (1 + 2i)] / [(1 - 2i) * (1 + 2i)]Okay, let me compute the numerator first. Multiplying 5 by (1 + 2i) should be straightforward. So, 5 times 1 is 5, and 5 times 2i is 10i. So the numerator becomes 5 + 10i.Now, the denominator is a product of two complex numbers: (1 - 2i) and (1 + 2i). I remember that when you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, you get a real number. Specifically, it's the square of the real part minus the square of the imaginary part. So, let me compute that.First, multiply 1 by 1, which is 1. Then, 1 times 2i is 2i. Next, -2i times 1 is -2i. Finally, -2i times 2i is -4i². So, putting it all together:1 + 2i - 2i - 4i²Wait, the middle terms, 2i and -2i, should cancel each other out, right? So that leaves me with 1 - 4i².But hold on, i² is equal to -1, so -4i² is the same as -4*(-1), which is +4. So, 1 + 4 is 5. So the denominator simplifies to 5.So now, the entire expression becomes:(5 + 10i) / 5Which can be split into two separate fractions:5/5 + 10i/5Simplifying each term, 5 divided by 5 is 1, and 10i divided by 5 is 2i. So, putting it together, the expression simplifies to:1 + 2iNow, the question asks for the real part of this complex number. In the expression 1 + 2i, the real part is 1, and the imaginary part is 2i. So, the real part is 1.Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I multiplied numerator and denominator by the conjugate, expanded both, simplified, and ended up with 1 + 2i. Yeah, that seems right. The real part is definitely 1.I guess another way to think about it is using the formula for the real part of a complex number in the form a + bi, which is just a. So, after simplifying, we have 1 as the real part and 2 as the coefficient of the imaginary part. So, yeah, 1 is the real part.Alternatively, if I didn't remember the conjugate method, I could have also represented the complex number in polar form and then divided, but that might be more complicated. The conjugate method seems straightforward and worked well here.Just to recap:1. Start with 5 / (1 - 2i)2. Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + 2i)3. Expand numerator: 5*(1 + 2i) = 5 + 10i4. Expand denominator: (1 - 2i)(1 + 2i) = 1 - (2i)^2 = 1 - (-4) = 55. Simplify: (5 + 10i)/5 = 1 + 2i6. Identify real part: 1Yep, that all checks out. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I'm confident that the real part is 1.**Final Answer**The real part is boxed{1}."},{"question":"In a sequence, if for all n in mathbb{N}^*, it holds that a_n cdot a_{n+1} cdot a_{n+2} = k (where k is a constant), then this sequence is called a geometric sequence, and k is called the common product. Given that the sequence {a_n} is a geometric sequence, and a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, with a common product of 8, find the sum a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{12}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence, but it's not the usual kind I'm used to. Normally, a geometric sequence has a common ratio where each term is multiplied by a constant to get the next term. But in this case, the problem says that for all natural numbers n, the product of three consecutive terms is a constant k, which is called the common product. So, it's a bit different. Let me try to understand this.Given that it's a geometric sequence with a common product k = 8, and the first two terms are a₁ = 1 and a₂ = 2. I need to find the sum of the first 12 terms: a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + a₁₂.First, let's write down what we know:1. a₁ = 12. a₂ = 23. For all n ∈ ℕ*, aₙ · aₙ₊₁ · aₙ₊₂ = 8So, starting from n = 1, we have:a₁ · a₂ · a₃ = 8We can plug in the known values:1 · 2 · a₃ = 8So, 2 · a₃ = 8 ⇒ a₃ = 4Alright, so a₃ is 4. Now, let's find a₄. Using the same condition for n = 2:a₂ · a₃ · a₄ = 8Plugging in the known values:2 · 4 · a₄ = 8So, 8 · a₄ = 8 ⇒ a₄ = 1Hmm, a₄ is 1. Interesting, it's the same as a₁. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Let's compute a few more terms.For n = 3:a₃ · a₄ · a₅ = 84 · 1 · a₅ = 8 ⇒ 4 · a₅ = 8 ⇒ a₅ = 2Wait, a₅ is 2, which is the same as a₂. Hmm, so a₅ = a₂. Let's do one more.For n = 4:a₄ · a₅ · a₆ = 81 · 2 · a₆ = 8 ⇒ 2 · a₆ = 8 ⇒ a₆ = 4So, a₆ = 4, which is the same as a₃. It seems like the sequence is repeating every three terms. Let me list out the terms I have so far:a₁ = 1a₂ = 2a₃ = 4a₄ = 1a₅ = 2a₆ = 4a₇ = 1a₈ = 2a₉ = 4a₁₀ = 1a₁₁ = 2a₁₂ = 4So, the sequence cycles through 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, and so on. Therefore, every three terms, the sequence repeats. That makes sense because each set of three terms multiplies to 8, so the next set of three terms must be the same to maintain the product.So, since the sequence is periodic with a period of 3, we can find the sum of each period and then multiply by the number of periods in 12 terms.First, let's find the sum of one period (three terms):1 + 2 + 4 = 7Now, how many periods are there in 12 terms? Since 12 divided by 3 is 4, there are 4 periods.Therefore, the total sum is 4 times the sum of one period:4 × 7 = 28Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Let me list all 12 terms and add them up:a₁ = 1a₂ = 2a₃ = 4a₄ = 1a₅ = 2a₆ = 4a₇ = 1a₈ = 2a₉ = 4a₁₀ = 1a₁₁ = 2a₁₂ = 4Adding them up:1 + 2 = 33 + 4 = 77 + 1 = 88 + 2 = 1010 + 4 = 1414 + 1 = 1515 + 2 = 1717 + 4 = 2121 + 1 = 2222 + 2 = 2424 + 4 = 28Yep, that's 28. So, the sum is 28.But just to make sure, let me think about the structure of the sequence again. Since each triplet multiplies to 8, and the first triplet is 1, 2, 4, which multiplies to 8. Then the next triplet is 1, 2, 4 again, so it's repeating every three terms. So, the sequence is periodic with period 3.Therefore, the sum over 12 terms, which is 4 periods, is 4 × (1 + 2 + 4) = 4 × 7 = 28.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The sum of the first 12 terms is boxed{28}."},{"question":"Dave breaks 2 guitar strings per night when playing live.

(Assume that all the boys run at constant, but not equal, speeds.)","answer":"First, I need to determine the speeds of Anton, Seryozha, and Tolya based on the information provided about their distances when each finished.When Anton finishes the 100-meter race, Seryozha is 10 meters behind, meaning Seryozha has run 90 meters. This indicates that Seryozha's speed is 90% of Anton's speed.Next, when Seryozha finishes the 100 meters, Tolya is 10 meters behind, so Tolya has run 90 meters at that point. This means Tolya's speed is 90% of Seryozha's speed.Since Seryozha's speed is 90% of Anton's, Tolya's speed is 81% of Anton's speed.Finally, to find out how far Tolya has run when Anton finishes the race, I multiply Anton's total distance by Tolya's speed relative to Anton's.

The two equal sides are both 9 units long.For the first case, if the two equal sides are 4 units each, the third side would be 9 units. However, this would violate the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Here, 4 + 4 is not greater than 9.For the second case, if the two equal sides are 9 units each, the third side would be 4 units.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step.First, let me understand the problem. I need to find numbers less than 5000. So, that means we're dealing with numbers from 1 up to 4999. These numbers need to satisfy two conditions: they must be divisible by 11, and the sum of their digits must be 13. So, I need to find all such numbers and count them.Alright, let's tackle the two conditions one by one. Maybe I can find numbers that satisfy both conditions by considering each condition separately and then finding their intersection.Starting with the digit sum condition: the sum of the digits is 13. Since we're dealing with numbers less than 5000, the numbers can have up to four digits. So, let's represent a number as a four-digit number, possibly with leading zeros. That is, numbers from 0001 to 4999. Wait, but leading zeros aren't actually part of the number, so maybe I should consider numbers with 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits. Hmm, maybe it's easier to consider all four-digit numbers with leading zeros allowed, so that each number is represented as a four-digit string, which can then be treated as a four-digit number. That might make the digit sum calculation more straightforward.So, if I consider numbers from 0000 to 4999, each represented as four digits, then the digit sum is the sum of all four digits. But wait, 0000 isn't a natural number, so we need to exclude that. Also, numbers like 0001 are just 1, which is a natural number. So, maybe this approach is okay.But actually, the digit sum of 0000 is 0, which isn't 13, so it won't be counted anyway. So, maybe it's fine to include it in our consideration and just subtract it later if needed.So, the problem reduces to finding all four-digit numbers (including those with leading zeros) from 0000 to 4999 where the sum of the digits is 13, and the number is divisible by 11. Then, we subtract 1 if 0000 is included, but since it's not a natural number, perhaps we can just count from 0001 to 4999.Wait, but 0000 isn't in our range, so we can just consider numbers from 0001 to 4999, which are all natural numbers less than 5000. So, that's 4999 numbers. But maybe it's better to consider all four-digit numbers with digits d1, d2, d3, d4, where d1 can be 0 to 4 (since the number is less than 5000), and d2, d3, d4 can be 0 to 9. The digit sum is d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 = 13. So, we need to find all such four-digit numbers where d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 = 13, and the number is divisible by 11.Now, the divisibility by 11 condition. I remember that a number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is a multiple of 11, including zero. So, for a four-digit number, the rule is: (d1 + d3) - (d2 + d4) is divisible by 11. So, that can be written as (d1 + d3) - (d2 + d4) ≡ 0 mod 11.So, combining both conditions: d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 = 13, and (d1 + d3) - (d2 + d4) ≡ 0 mod 11.Hmm, maybe I can express these two equations together.Let me denote S = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 = 13.And let me denote T = (d1 + d3) - (d2 + d4) ≡ 0 mod 11.So, from S, we have d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 = 13.From T, we have d1 + d3 ≡ d2 + d4 mod 11.But since S = 13, and T is a multiple of 11, let's see if we can find a relationship between S and T.Let me denote A = d1 + d3 and B = d2 + d4.Then, S = A + B = 13.And T = A - B ≡ 0 mod 11.So, from T, we have A ≡ B mod 11.But since A + B = 13, and A ≡ B mod 11, let's see what possible values A and B can take.Since A and B are sums of digits, each can range from 0 to 18 (since d1 can be up to 4, and d2, d3, d4 up to 9, so A is d1 + d3, which can be 0 + 0 = 0 up to 4 + 9 = 13, and similarly B is d2 + d4, which can be 0 + 0 = 0 up to 9 + 9 = 18).So, A can be from 0 to 13, and B can be from 0 to 18. But since A + B = 13, A can be from max(0, 13 - 18) = 0 to min(13, 13) = 13. So, A can be 0 to 13, and B = 13 - A.Also, from T, A ≡ B mod 11, which is equivalent to A ≡ (13 - A) mod 11.So, let's write that: A ≡ 13 - A mod 11.Bringing A to the left: 2A ≡ 13 mod 11.Simplify 13 mod 11: 13 - 11 = 2, so 13 ≡ 2 mod 11.Thus, 2A ≡ 2 mod 11.Divide both sides by 2: A ≡ 1 mod 11.So, A must be congruent to 1 modulo 11.But A is between 0 and 13, so possible values of A are 1 and 12 (since 1 + 11 = 12, which is still less than or equal to 13). 12 + 11 = 23, which is beyond 13, so only A = 1 and A = 12.Therefore, A can be either 1 or 12.So, if A = 1, then B = 13 - 1 = 12.If A = 12, then B = 13 - 12 = 1.So, now we have two cases:Case 1: A = 1, B = 12.Case 2: A = 12, B = 1.So, now, for each case, we can find the number of four-digit numbers (with d1 from 0 to 4, others from 0 to 9) such that d1 + d3 = A and d2 + d4 = B.So, let's handle each case separately.Case 1: A = 1, B = 12.So, d1 + d3 = 1, and d2 + d4 = 12.We need to find the number of solutions for each equation, considering the constraints on the digits.First, d1 is from 0 to 4, and d3 is from 0 to 9.So, d1 + d3 = 1.Possible pairs (d1, d3):d1 can be 0 or 1, since d1 + d3 = 1.If d1 = 0, then d3 = 1.If d1 = 1, then d3 = 0.d1 cannot be 2 or higher because d3 would be negative, which isn't allowed.So, there are 2 possible pairs for (d1, d3).Now, for d2 + d4 = 12.d2 and d4 are digits from 0 to 9.So, the number of solutions to d2 + d4 = 12 is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions where d2 and d4 are between 0 and 9.The number of solutions without considering the upper limit is 13 (from d2=3 to d2=9, but actually, wait, 12 can be expressed as 0+12, 1+11, ..., 12+0, but since d2 and d4 are digits, they can't exceed 9.So, the valid solutions are where d2 and d4 are between 3 and 9, because 12 - 9 = 3, so d2 must be at least 3 and at most 9, and d4 would be 12 - d2, which would be between 3 and 9 as well.So, the number of solutions is 13 - 2*3 = 7? Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, actually, the number of solutions where d2 and d4 are between 0 and 9 is equal to the number of integers d2 such that d2 is between max(0, 12 - 9) and min(9, 12). So, max(0, 3) = 3, min(9, 12) = 9. So, d2 can be from 3 to 9, inclusive. That's 7 values: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So, 7 solutions.Therefore, for d2 + d4 = 12, there are 7 solutions.So, for Case 1, the total number of four-digit numbers is the number of (d1, d3) pairs multiplied by the number of (d2, d4) pairs, which is 2 * 7 = 14.But wait, hold on. We need to make sure that the four-digit number is less than 5000. Since d1 is from 0 to 4, and we already considered d1 in the (d1, d3) pairs, which were (0,1) and (1,0). So, d1 is either 0 or 1, which is within 0 to 4, so all these numbers are less than 5000. So, 14 numbers in Case 1.Case 2: A = 12, B = 1.So, d1 + d3 = 12, and d2 + d4 = 1.Again, let's find the number of solutions for each equation.First, d1 + d3 = 12.d1 is from 0 to 4, and d3 is from 0 to 9.So, d1 can be from 3 to 4 because d1 + d3 = 12.If d1 = 3, then d3 = 9.If d1 = 4, then d3 = 8.d1 cannot be 2 or lower because d3 would have to be 10 or more, which is invalid.So, there are 2 possible pairs for (d1, d3): (3,9) and (4,8).Now, for d2 + d4 = 1.d2 and d4 are digits from 0 to 9.The number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to d2 + d4 = 1, which is 2: (0,1) and (1,0).So, for d2 + d4 = 1, there are 2 solutions.Therefore, for Case 2, the total number of four-digit numbers is 2 * 2 = 4.Again, since d1 is from 3 to 4, which is within 0 to 4, all these numbers are less than 5000. So, 4 numbers in Case 2.Therefore, the total number of four-digit numbers (including leading zeros) that satisfy both conditions is 14 + 4 = 18.But wait, hold on. These are four-digit numbers, but some of them might actually be three-digit, two-digit, or one-digit numbers when leading zeros are removed. However, since we're considering numbers less than 5000, which includes all numbers from 1 to 4999, and we've already considered all four-digit numbers with leading zeros, which correspond to numbers from 0000 to 4999. But 0000 isn't a natural number, so we need to check if any of the numbers we counted are 0000, but in our cases, the digit sums are 13, so 0000 isn't included. So, all 18 numbers are valid natural numbers less than 5000.Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. When we considered four-digit numbers with leading zeros, we included numbers like 0001, which is just 1, but in our digit sum, 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which isn't 13. So, actually, in our counting, we considered four-digit numbers where the digit sum is 13, so numbers like 0001 wouldn't be included because their digit sum is 1, not 13. So, all the 18 numbers we found have a digit sum of 13, so they are all valid natural numbers less than 5000.Therefore, the total number is 18.Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with modular arithmetic, especially with digit sums and divisibility, it's easy to make a mistake.So, first, we had S = 13, and T = A - B ≡ 0 mod 11, which led us to 2A ≡ 2 mod 11, so A ≡ 1 mod 11. Since A can be at most 13, the possible values for A are 1 and 12. Then, for each A, we found the number of solutions.In Case 1, A = 1, so d1 + d3 = 1. Since d1 can be 0 or 1, we have two possibilities. Then, d2 + d4 = 12, which has 7 solutions. So, 2 * 7 = 14.In Case 2, A = 12, so d1 + d3 = 12. Since d1 can be 3 or 4, we have two possibilities. Then, d2 + d4 = 1, which has 2 solutions. So, 2 * 2 = 4.14 + 4 = 18. So, that seems correct.But let me verify if all these numbers are indeed less than 5000. Since d1 is from 0 to 4, and in both cases, d1 is either 0,1,3,4, which are all less than 5, so yes, all numbers are less than 5000.Wait, but hold on. Let me think about the four-digit numbers. For example, in Case 1, when d1 = 0, the number is actually a three-digit number, but since we're considering leading zeros, it's treated as a four-digit number. However, when we remove the leading zeros, the number is still less than 5000, so it's fine.Therefore, I think 18 is the correct count.But just to be thorough, let me try to think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by generating all numbers less than 5000 divisible by 11 and then checking their digit sums. But that might be time-consuming, but perhaps for a smaller range, it's manageable.Wait, 5000 divided by 11 is approximately 454.54, so there are 454 numbers less than 5000 divisible by 11 (since 11*454=4994). So, 454 numbers. Checking each of them for digit sum 13 would be tedious, but maybe we can find a pattern or use another method.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem of finding numbers N < 5000 such that N ≡ 0 mod 11 and digit_sum(N) = 13.But I think the way I approached it initially is correct, using the digit sum and the divisibility rule, which led me to 18 numbers.Wait, but let me think again about the modular equation.We had S = 13, T = A - B ≡ 0 mod 11.So, A + B = 13, and A - B ≡ 0 mod 11.So, adding these two equations: 2A ≡ 13 mod 11.13 mod 11 is 2, so 2A ≡ 2 mod 11, which simplifies to A ≡ 1 mod 11.So, A can be 1 or 12, as I had before.So, that seems correct.Therefore, I think 18 is the correct answer.But just to be absolutely sure, let me try to think of some examples.In Case 1: A = 1, so d1 + d3 = 1.Possible (d1, d3): (0,1) and (1,0).Then, d2 + d4 = 12.Possible (d2, d4): (3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (9,3).So, for each (d1, d3), we can pair with each (d2, d4).So, for (0,1):Numbers would be 0 d2 1 d4. So, four-digit numbers like 0319, 0418, 0517, 0616, 0715, 0814, 0913.Similarly, for (1,0):Numbers would be 1 d2 0 d4. So, 1309, 1408, 1507, 1606, 1705, 1804, 1903.So, that's 7 + 7 = 14 numbers.Similarly, in Case 2: A = 12, so d1 + d3 = 12.Possible (d1, d3): (3,9) and (4,8).Then, d2 + d4 = 1.Possible (d2, d4): (0,1) and (1,0).So, for (3,9):Numbers would be 3 d2 9 d4. So, 3091, 3190.For (4,8):Numbers would be 4 d2 8 d4. So, 4081, 4180.So, that's 2 + 2 = 4 numbers.So, total numbers: 14 + 4 = 18.Yes, that seems correct.Wait, but let me check if these numbers are indeed divisible by 11.Take one example from Case 1: 0319.Applying the divisibility rule: (0 + 1) - (3 + 9) = 1 - 12 = -11, which is divisible by 11. So, yes.Another example: 1309.(1 + 0) - (3 + 9) = 1 - 12 = -11, divisible by 11.From Case 2: 3091.(3 + 9) - (0 + 1) = 12 - 1 = 11, divisible by 11.Another example: 4081.(4 + 8) - (0 + 1) = 12 - 1 = 11, divisible by 11.So, all these examples satisfy the divisibility condition.Also, their digit sums:For 0319: 0 + 3 + 1 + 9 = 13.For 1309: 1 + 3 + 0 + 9 = 13.For 3091: 3 + 0 + 9 + 1 = 13.For 4081: 4 + 0 + 8 + 1 = 13.So, all correct.Therefore, I'm confident that the total number is 18.**Final Answer**The number of natural numbers less than 5000 that are divisible by 11 and have a digit sum of 13 is boxed{18}."},{"question":"The Ivanov family owns an apartment with essential property worth 3 million rubles, a car currently valued at 900 thousand rubles, and savings which include 300 thousand rubles in a bank deposit, 200 thousand rubles in securities, and 100 thousand rubles in liquid form on a bank card and in cash.

Then, part (2) is about finding the minimum value of 1/m + 4/n given that m + n = 2k, where k is the maximum value of a from part (1). Hmm, let's tackle part (1) first.Alright, for the function f(x) to have a domain of all real numbers R, the expression inside the square root, which is |2x - 1| + |x + 1| - a, must be non-negative for all x in R. So, I need to ensure that |2x - 1| + |x + 1| - a ≥ 0 for all x. That means |2x - 1| + |x + 1| ≥ a for all x. Therefore, the smallest value that |2x - 1| + |x + 1| can take is the minimum value of this expression, and a must be less than or equal to that minimum.So, the key is to find the minimum value of |2x - 1| + |x + 1|. Once I find that, say it's M, then a must be ≤ M. So, the range of a is (-∞, M].Alright, so how do I find the minimum of |2x - 1| + |x + 1|? Since this is a sum of absolute value functions, it's a piecewise linear function, and its minimum occurs at one of the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change their behavior, i.e., where 2x - 1 = 0 or x + 1 = 0.So, let's find those critical points:1. 2x - 1 = 0 ⇒ x = 1/22. x + 1 = 0 ⇒ x = -1So, the critical points are at x = -1 and x = 1/2. Therefore, I should analyze the function |2x - 1| + |x + 1| in the intervals determined by these points: (-∞, -1), [-1, 1/2), and [1/2, ∞).Let me break it down:1. For x < -1:   - |2x - 1| = -(2x - 1) = -2x + 1   - |x + 1| = -(x + 1) = -x - 1   So, the expression becomes (-2x + 1) + (-x - 1) = -3x + 0 = -3x2. For -1 ≤ x < 1/2:   - |2x - 1| = -(2x - 1) = -2x + 1   - |x + 1| = x + 1   So, the expression becomes (-2x + 1) + (x + 1) = (-2x + x) + (1 + 1) = -x + 23. For x ≥ 1/2:   - |2x - 1| = 2x - 1   - |x + 1| = x + 1   So, the expression becomes (2x - 1) + (x + 1) = 3x + 0 = 3xSo, now I have the expression broken down into three linear pieces:- For x < -1: f(x) = -3x- For -1 ≤ x < 1/2: f(x) = -x + 2- For x ≥ 1/2: f(x) = 3xNow, to find the minimum of this function, I need to analyze each interval.First, for x < -1: f(x) = -3x. Since x is less than -1, as x decreases, f(x) increases because it's -3 times x, which is negative. So, the minimum in this interval occurs at x = -1, where f(-1) = -3*(-1) = 3.Next, for -1 ≤ x < 1/2: f(x) = -x + 2. This is a linear function with a negative slope, so it's decreasing as x increases. Therefore, its minimum occurs at the right endpoint, which is x = 1/2. Let's compute f(1/2): -1/2 + 2 = 3/2.Finally, for x ≥ 1/2: f(x) = 3x. This is a linear function with a positive slope, so it's increasing as x increases. Therefore, its minimum occurs at x = 1/2, which is f(1/2) = 3*(1/2) = 3/2.So, putting it all together, the function |2x - 1| + |x + 1| has a minimum value at x = 1/2, which is 3/2. Therefore, the minimum value M is 3/2.Hence, for the expression inside the square root to be non-negative for all x, we must have a ≤ 3/2. So, the range of a is (-∞, 3/2].Wait, let me double-check that. So, the function f(x) is the sum of two absolute values, which we've broken down into three intervals. The minimum occurs at x = 1/2, where the function is 3/2. So, yes, that seems correct. So, a must be less than or equal to 3/2.Therefore, the range of a is all real numbers a such that a ≤ 3/2, which is (-∞, 3/2].Alright, that was part (1). Now, moving on to part (2). It says that if the maximum value of a is k, which from part (1) is 3/2, so k = 3/2. Then, m + n = 2k, which is 2*(3/2) = 3. So, m + n = 3, with m > 0 and n > 0. We need to find the minimum value of 1/m + 4/n.So, we have m + n = 3, m > 0, n > 0, and we need to minimize 1/m + 4/n.This seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or maybe the AM-GM inequality. Let me think.Alternatively, since it's a two-variable optimization, we can express n in terms of m: n = 3 - m, then substitute into the expression 1/m + 4/n, and then find the minimum with respect to m.Let me try that approach.So, let n = 3 - m. Then, the expression becomes:E = 1/m + 4/(3 - m)We need to find the minimum of E with respect to m, where m > 0 and 3 - m > 0, so 0 < m < 3.So, let's compute the derivative of E with respect to m and set it to zero.First, compute dE/dm:dE/dm = -1/m² + 4/(3 - m)² * (1) [Wait, no. Wait, derivative of 4/(3 - m) with respect to m is 4*(1/(3 - m))' = 4*(1/(3 - m))' = 4*(0 - (-1)/(3 - m)²) = 4/(3 - m)².Wait, no, hold on. Let me compute it step by step.E = 1/m + 4/(3 - m)So, dE/dm = derivative of 1/m + derivative of 4/(3 - m)Derivative of 1/m is -1/m².Derivative of 4/(3 - m) is 4 * derivative of 1/(3 - m) = 4 * (0 - (-1))/(3 - m)² = 4/(3 - m)².Wait, actually, derivative of 1/(3 - m) is (0 - (-1))/(3 - m)² = 1/(3 - m)². So, derivative of 4/(3 - m) is 4/(3 - m)².So, putting it together:dE/dm = -1/m² + 4/(3 - m)²Set this equal to zero for critical points:-1/m² + 4/(3 - m)² = 0So,4/(3 - m)² = 1/m²Cross-multiplying:4m² = (3 - m)²Expand the right-hand side:4m² = 9 - 6m + m²Bring all terms to one side:4m² - m² + 6m - 9 = 0Simplify:3m² + 6m - 9 = 0Divide both sides by 3:m² + 2m - 3 = 0Now, solve for m:m = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [-2 ± 4]/2So, two solutions:1. m = (-2 + 4)/2 = 2/2 = 12. m = (-2 - 4)/2 = -6/2 = -3But m must be greater than 0 and less than 3, so m = 1 is the valid solution.So, m = 1, then n = 3 - 1 = 2.Therefore, the minimum occurs at m = 1, n = 2.Compute E at this point:E = 1/1 + 4/2 = 1 + 2 = 3.So, the minimum value is 3.Wait, let me verify if this is indeed a minimum. Since the function E is convex in the interval (0, 3), the critical point we found should be the global minimum.Alternatively, we can use the second derivative test.Compute the second derivative of E:d²E/dm² = 2/m³ + 8/(3 - m)³At m = 1, this is 2/1 + 8/(2)³ = 2 + 8/8 = 2 + 1 = 3, which is positive, so it's a local minimum.Therefore, the minimum value is indeed 3.Alternatively, we could have used the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the AM-GM inequality.Let me try the AM-GM approach.We need to minimize 1/m + 4/n with m + n = 3.Let me denote m = x, n = y, so x + y = 3, x > 0, y > 0.We need to minimize 1/x + 4/y.Let me use the method of Lagrange multipliers.Define the function to minimize: f(x, y) = 1/x + 4/ySubject to the constraint g(x, y) = x + y - 3 = 0.The Lagrangian is L = 1/x + 4/y - λ(x + y - 3)Compute the partial derivatives:∂L/∂x = -1/x² - λ = 0 ⇒ -1/x² = λ∂L/∂y = -4/y² - λ = 0 ⇒ -4/y² = λSet them equal:-1/x² = -4/y² ⇒ 1/x² = 4/y² ⇒ y² = 4x² ⇒ y = 2x (since y > 0, x > 0)From the constraint x + y = 3, and y = 2x, so x + 2x = 3 ⇒ 3x = 3 ⇒ x = 1, so y = 2.Therefore, the minimum occurs at x = 1, y = 2, and the minimum value is 1/1 + 4/2 = 3.Same result as before.Alternatively, using Cauchy-Schwarz:(1/m + 4/n)(m + n) ≥ (√1 + √4)² = (1 + 2)² = 9So, (1/m + 4/n)(3) ≥ 9 ⇒ 1/m + 4/n ≥ 3Equality holds when 1/m = 4/n, which implies n = 4m. But since m + n = 3, substituting n = 4m gives m + 4m = 3 ⇒ 5m = 3 ⇒ m = 3/5, n = 12/5. Wait, that contradicts our earlier result. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, no, actually, in Cauchy-Schwarz, the equality condition is when (1, 2) is proportional to (sqrt(m), sqrt(n)). Wait, let me recall.Wait, Cauchy-Schwarz in the form (a1^2 + a2^2)(b1^2 + b2^2) ≥ (a1b1 + a2b2)^2.But I used a different form here. Maybe I should write it correctly.Let me write it as:(1/m + 4/n)(m + n) ≥ (√(1/m * m) + √(4/n * n))² = (1 + 2)^2 = 9So, (1/m + 4/n)(3) ≥ 9 ⇒ 1/m + 4/n ≥ 3, with equality when (1/m)/m = (4/n)/n ⇒ 1/m² = 4/n² ⇒ n = 2m.So, n = 2m, and m + n = 3 ⇒ m + 2m = 3 ⇒ 3m = 3 ⇒ m = 1, n = 2.Ah, okay, so that's consistent with the earlier results. So, the minimum is indeed 3.Therefore, the minimum value of 1/m + 4/n is 3.So, summarizing:(1) The range of a is (-∞, 3/2].(2) The minimum value is 3.**Final Answer**(1) The range of ( a ) is (boxed{(-infty, dfrac{3}{2}]}).(2) The minimum value is (boxed{3})."},{"question":"Given that one root of the equation x^{2}-x-m=0 is 3, find m.","answer":"First, I recognize that if ( x = 3 ) is a root of the quadratic equation ( x^2 - x - m = 0 ), then substituting ( x = 3 ) into the equation should satisfy it.Substituting ( x = 3 ) into the equation gives:[3^2 - 3 - m = 0]Simplifying the left side:[9 - 3 - m = 0][6 - m = 0]Solving for ( m ):[m = 6]"},{"question":"The cost of five pencils and one pen is 2.50, and the cost of one pencil and two pens is 1.85. What is the cost of two pencils and one pen?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about the cost of pencils and pens. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but if I break them down, I think I can manage.First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. It says: \\"The cost of five pencils and one pen is 2.50, and the cost of one pencil and two pens is 1.85. What is the cost of two pencils and one pen?\\" Okay, so we have two different combinations of pencils and pens with their total costs, and we need to find the cost of another combination.Hmm, this sounds like a system of equations problem. I remember that when you have two unknowns, you can set up two equations and solve them simultaneously. Let me assign variables to the unknowns. Let's say the cost of one pencil is ( p ) dollars and the cost of one pen is ( q ) dollars. That seems straightforward.So, translating the first statement into an equation: \\"The cost of five pencils and one pen is 2.50.\\" That would be ( 5p + q = 2.50 ). Got that. And the second statement: \\"The cost of one pencil and two pens is 1.85.\\" That translates to ( p + 2q = 1.85 ).Now, I have two equations:1. ( 5p + q = 2.50 )2. ( p + 2q = 1.85 )I need to solve for ( p ) and ( q ), and then find the cost of two pencils and one pen, which would be ( 2p + q ). So, let me focus on solving these equations first.I think the best way to solve this system is by using either substitution or elimination. Let me consider both methods and see which one is easier here.Starting with substitution: From the first equation, I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for ( q ) because it has a coefficient of 1, which might be simpler.From equation 1: ( 5p + q = 2.50 )Subtract ( 5p ) from both sides: ( q = 2.50 - 5p )Okay, so now I have ( q ) expressed in terms of ( p ). I can substitute this expression into equation 2 to find the value of ( p ).Equation 2: ( p + 2q = 1.85 )Substituting ( q ) from above: ( p + 2(2.50 - 5p) = 1.85 )Let me simplify this step by step.First, distribute the 2 into the parentheses:( p + 2 * 2.50 - 2 * 5p = 1.85 )Calculating each term:( p + 5.00 - 10p = 1.85 )Combine like terms. The ( p ) terms and the constant terms.( (p - 10p) + 5.00 = 1.85 )( (-9p) + 5.00 = 1.85 )Now, subtract 5.00 from both sides to isolate the term with ( p ):( -9p = 1.85 - 5.00 )Calculating the right side:( 1.85 - 5.00 = -3.15 )So, ( -9p = -3.15 )Now, divide both sides by -9 to solve for ( p ):( p = (-3.15) / (-9) )Dividing two negative numbers gives a positive result:( p = 0.35 )So, the cost of one pencil is 0.35. Now, let's find the cost of one pen, ( q ).We had earlier found that ( q = 2.50 - 5p ). Plugging in ( p = 0.35 ):( q = 2.50 - 5 * 0.35 )Calculate ( 5 * 0.35 ):( 5 * 0.35 = 1.75 )So, ( q = 2.50 - 1.75 = 0.75 )Therefore, the cost of one pen is 0.75.Let me double-check these values to make sure they satisfy both original equations.First equation: ( 5p + q = 2.50 )Plugging in ( p = 0.35 ) and ( q = 0.75 ):( 5 * 0.35 + 0.75 = 1.75 + 0.75 = 2.50 ). That checks out.Second equation: ( p + 2q = 1.85 )Plugging in the values:( 0.35 + 2 * 0.75 = 0.35 + 1.50 = 1.85 ). Perfect, that also works.So, now that I have the individual costs, I can find the cost of two pencils and one pen.That would be ( 2p + q ).Substituting ( p = 0.35 ) and ( q = 0.75 ):( 2 * 0.35 + 0.75 = 0.70 + 0.75 = 1.45 )So, the cost of two pencils and one pen is 1.45.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me go through the steps again.First, solving for ( q ) in terms of ( p ):From equation 1: ( q = 2.50 - 5p )Substituted into equation 2: ( p + 2*(2.50 - 5p) = 1.85 )Which simplifies to ( p + 5.00 - 10p = 1.85 )Combine like terms: ( -9p + 5.00 = 1.85 )Subtract 5.00: ( -9p = -3.15 )Divide by -9: ( p = 0.35 ). Correct.Then, ( q = 2.50 - 5*0.35 = 2.50 - 1.75 = 0.75 ). Correct.Then, ( 2p + q = 2*0.35 + 0.75 = 0.70 + 0.75 = 1.45 ). Yes, that seems right.Alternatively, just to explore another method, maybe I can solve the system using elimination instead of substitution, just to cross-verify.So, starting with the two equations:1. ( 5p + q = 2.50 )2. ( p + 2q = 1.85 )If I want to eliminate one variable, let's say ( q ), I can manipulate the equations so that the coefficients of ( q ) are the same or opposites.Looking at equation 1, the coefficient of ( q ) is 1, and in equation 2, it's 2. So, if I multiply equation 1 by 2, the coefficients of ( q ) will be 2 in both, allowing me to subtract the equations to eliminate ( q ).Multiply equation 1 by 2:1. ( 10p + 2q = 5.00 )Equation 2 remains the same:2. ( p + 2q = 1.85 )Now, subtract equation 2 from the new equation 1:( (10p + 2q) - (p + 2q) = 5.00 - 1.85 )Simplify:( 10p + 2q - p - 2q = 3.15 )Combine like terms:( 9p = 3.15 )Divide both sides by 9:( p = 3.15 / 9 = 0.35 )Same result as before. Then, substitute back into one of the original equations to find ( q ). Let's use equation 1:( 5p + q = 2.50 )( 5*0.35 + q = 2.50 )( 1.75 + q = 2.50 )Subtract 1.75:( q = 0.75 )Same as before. So, both methods give me the same values for ( p ) and ( q ). Therefore, I can be confident that these are the correct individual costs.Now, just to recap, since the problem is asking for the cost of two pencils and one pen, which is ( 2p + q ), substituting the values:( 2*0.35 + 0.75 = 0.70 + 0.75 = 1.45 )So, the total cost is 1.45. That seems reasonable given the initial prices.Let me think if there's another way to approach this without solving for ( p ) and ( q ) individually. Maybe by combining the two given equations in a way that directly gives me ( 2p + q ).Looking at the two equations:1. ( 5p + q = 2.50 )2. ( p + 2q = 1.85 )I need to find ( 2p + q ). Hmm, perhaps I can manipulate the equations to express ( 2p + q ) in terms of the given totals.Let me denote ( x = 2p + q ), which is what we need to find. So, ( x = 2p + q ).Looking at equation 1: ( 5p + q = 2.50 ). If I subtract ( 3p ) from both sides, I get ( 2p + q = 2.50 - 3p ). Wait, that's interesting because ( 2p + q ) is exactly ( x ). So, ( x = 2.50 - 3p ).But I don't know ( p ) yet, so that might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can express ( x ) in terms of the two equations.Let me see. If I have equation 1: ( 5p + q = 2.50 ) and equation 2: ( p + 2q = 1.85 ). Maybe I can find a linear combination of these equations that gives me ( 2p + q ).Let me denote equation 1 as Eq1 and equation 2 as Eq2.Suppose I multiply Eq1 by a and Eq2 by b, then add them together to get ( 2p + q ).So, ( a*(5p + q) + b*(p + 2q) = 2p + q )Which gives:( 5a p + a q + b p + 2b q = 2p + q )Combine like terms:( (5a + b) p + (a + 2b) q = 2p + q )Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations for the coefficients:1. ( 5a + b = 2 ) (coefficient of p)2. ( a + 2b = 1 ) (coefficient of q)Now, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns ( a ) and ( b ). Let's solve this system.From equation 1: ( 5a + b = 2 )From equation 2: ( a + 2b = 1 )Let me solve equation 1 for ( b ):( b = 2 - 5a )Now, substitute this into equation 2:( a + 2*(2 - 5a) = 1 )Simplify:( a + 4 - 10a = 1 )Combine like terms:( -9a + 4 = 1 )Subtract 4:( -9a = -3 )Divide by -9:( a = (-3)/(-9) = 1/3 )So, ( a = 1/3 ). Now, substitute back into ( b = 2 - 5a ):( b = 2 - 5*(1/3) = 2 - 5/3 = (6/3 - 5/3) = 1/3 )So, ( a = 1/3 ) and ( b = 1/3 ). Therefore, if I take one-third of Eq1 and one-third of Eq2 and add them together, I will get ( 2p + q ).Let me compute that:( (1/3)*Eq1 + (1/3)*Eq2 = (1/3)*(5p + q) + (1/3)*(p + 2q) )Calculate each term:( (5p/3 + q/3) + (p/3 + 2q/3) = (5p/3 + p/3) + (q/3 + 2q/3) )Combine like terms:( (6p/3) + (3q/3) = 2p + q )Which is exactly what we wanted. Now, let's compute the right side of the equation:( (1/3)*2.50 + (1/3)*1.85 )Compute each term:( 2.50 / 3 = 0.8333... ) (approximately 0.8333)( 1.85 / 3 = 0.6166... ) (approximately 0.6166)Adding them together:( 0.8333 + 0.6166 = 1.4499 ), which is approximately 1.45.So, this method also gives us the same result, 1.45, for ( 2p + q ). Therefore, regardless of the method I use, substitution, elimination, or linear combination, I arrive at the same answer.Just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem, perhaps by trial and error or estimation, but given that it's a system of equations, algebraic methods seem the most straightforward.Alternatively, someone might set up a table to organize the information:| Item       | Pencils | Pens | Total Cost ||------------|---------|------|------------|| First Set  | 5       | 1    | 2.50      || Second Set | 1       | 2    | 1.85      || Desired Set| 2       | 1    | ?          |But without knowing the individual prices, it's not immediately obvious how to get from the first two sets to the desired set. So, setting up equations seems necessary.Another thought: Maybe express the desired set as a combination of the given sets. For example, can I find multipliers ( m ) and ( n ) such that:( m*(5p + q) + n*(p + 2q) = 2p + q )Which is similar to the linear combination approach I took earlier. Solving for ( m ) and ( n ):( 5m + n = 2 ) (for pencils)( m + 2n = 1 ) (for pens)This is the same system as before, leading to ( m = 1/3 ) and ( n = 1/3 ). So, again, the same result.I think I've explored multiple methods here, and all point to the same answer, so I feel confident that 1.45 is correct.Just to recap, the steps were:1. Assign variables to the unknowns (pencil and pen costs).2. Translate the given information into a system of equations.3. Solve the system using substitution or elimination.4. Verify the solution by plugging back into the original equations.5. Calculate the desired combination using the found values.6. Alternatively, use linear combinations of the original equations to directly find the desired combination without solving for individual prices.All methods converged on the same answer, so I think that's solid.One last check: If two pencils and one pen cost 1.45, then let's see if that makes sense with the original prices.From the first set, five pencils and one pen cost 2.50. If two pencils and one pen cost 1.45, then three pencils would cost 2.50 - 1.45 = 1.05. So, each pencil would cost 1.05 / 3 = 0.35, which matches our earlier calculation.Similarly, from the second set, one pencil and two pens cost 1.85. If one pencil is 0.35, then two pens would cost 1.85 - 0.35 = 1.50, so each pen is 0.75, which again matches our earlier result.Therefore, everything is consistent. The individual prices make sense, and the desired combination's cost is consistent with them.I think I've thought this through thoroughly. I considered different methods, double-checked my work, and everything lines up. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 1.45.**Final Answer**The cost of two pencils and one pen is boxed{1.45}."},{"question":"From a group of 1500 students participating in the final exam of the Nanchang Four-School Joint Examination, numbered randomly from 0001, 0002, ..., to 1500, a sample is extracted for score analysis using systematic sampling. Given that the two smallest numbers in the sample are 0018 and 0068, what should be the largest number in the sample? ( )A: 1466B: 1467C: 1468D: 1469","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about systematic sampling. Let me try to understand what it's asking. There are 1500 students numbered from 0001 to 1500. They used systematic sampling to extract a sample, and the two smallest numbers in the sample are 0018 and 0068. I need to find the largest number in the sample, and the options are A:1466, B:1467, C:1468, D:1469.Hmm, systematic sampling. From what I remember, systematic sampling is a method where you select every k-th element from a population. So first, you determine the sampling interval k, which is usually the population size divided by the sample size. But in this problem, they don't specify the sample size. Hmm, that might be an issue. Wait, maybe I can figure it out from the given information.They gave me the two smallest numbers in the sample: 0018 and 0068. So, if it's systematic sampling, the difference between these two numbers should be the sampling interval k. Let me calculate that. 0068 minus 0018 is 50. So, k is 50. That means every 50th student is selected after a random start.Wait, so the sampling interval k is 50. So, starting from some random number between 1 and 50, then adding 50 each time. So, the first number is 0018, then the next is 0068, then 0118, 0168, and so on.But hold on, the first number is 0018, which is less than 50, so that makes sense as a starting point. So, the starting point is 18, and then we add 50 each time. So, the sequence is 18, 68, 118, 168, ..., up to some maximum number less than or equal to 1500.So, to find the largest number in the sample, I need to find the last term in this sequence. Since the population size is 1500, the last term should be the largest number less than or equal to 1500 in the sequence starting at 18 with a common difference of 50.Let me think about how to find the last term. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. So, in this case, a_1 is 18, d is 50, and a_n should be less than or equal to 1500.So, let's set up the equation: 18 + (n-1)*50 ≤ 1500.Let me solve for n:(n-1)*50 ≤ 1500 - 18(n-1)*50 ≤ 1482n - 1 ≤ 1482 / 50n - 1 ≤ 29.64n ≤ 30.64Since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 30. So, the 30th term is the last term in the sample. Let me calculate that:a_30 = 18 + (30 - 1)*50= 18 + 29*50= 18 + 1450= 1468So, the largest number in the sample should be 1468. Looking at the options, that's option C.Wait, but let me double-check. If n is 30, then the 30th term is 1468. The next term would be 1468 + 50 = 1518, which is beyond 1500, so that's correct. So, 1468 is indeed the last term.But just to make sure, let me think about the starting point. If the first term is 18, then the next terms are 68, 118, 168, ..., 1468. So, adding 50 each time. So, 1468 is the last one before exceeding 1500.Alternatively, another way to think about it is: the starting point is 18, and each subsequent term is 50 apart. So, the maximum term is 18 + 50*(n-1). We need this to be ≤1500.So, 50*(n-1) ≤ 1482n-1 ≤ 29.64n ≤ 30.64, so n=30.Thus, the last term is 18 + 50*(29) = 18 + 1450 = 1468.Yes, that's consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can calculate how many terms there are. Since the first term is 18, and the difference is 50, the number of terms is floor((1500 - 18)/50) + 1.Let me compute that:(1500 - 18) = 14821482 / 50 = 29.64Floor of that is 29, so number of terms is 29 + 1 = 30.Therefore, the last term is 18 + 50*(30 - 1) = 1468.So, yeah, that seems correct.Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes in systematic sampling, the starting point is random between 1 and k, but in this case, the first number is 18, which is less than 50, so that's consistent with k=50.So, the sampling interval is 50, starting at 18, so the sample consists of 18, 68, 118, ..., 1468.Therefore, the largest number is 1468, which is option C.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"In triangle ABC, the angle bisectors of angle BAC and angle ABC intersect at point O. Find angle ACB if angle AOB is 125^circ.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here: In triangle ABC, the angle bisectors of angles BAC and ABC intersect at point O. I need to find angle ACB if angle AOB is 125 degrees. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.First, I remember that in a triangle, the intersection of the angle bisectors is called the incenter. So, point O is the incenter of triangle ABC. The incenter is equidistant from all sides of the triangle and is the center of the inscribed circle. Okay, that makes sense.Now, angle AOB is given as 125 degrees. I need to relate this angle to the angles of triangle ABC. I think there's a formula or a property that connects the angles at the incenter with the angles of the original triangle. Let me recall.I remember that the measure of an angle formed by two angle bisectors can be related to the angles of the triangle. Specifically, the angle at the incenter opposite to a vertex is equal to 90 degrees plus half the measure of the angle at that vertex. Wait, is that right? Let me think.Actually, I think the formula is that the angle between two angle bisectors is equal to 90 degrees plus half the measure of the third angle. So, in this case, angle AOB is formed by the bisectors of angles BAC and ABC. Therefore, angle AOB should be equal to 90 degrees plus half of angle ACB. Let me write that down.So, angle AOB = 90° + (1/2) * angle ACB.Given that angle AOB is 125°, I can set up the equation:125° = 90° + (1/2) * angle ACB.Now, subtracting 90° from both sides gives:125° - 90° = (1/2) * angle ACB.That simplifies to:35° = (1/2) * angle ACB.Multiplying both sides by 2:70° = angle ACB.So, angle ACB is 70 degrees. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me verify if I applied the formula correctly.Wait, let me make sure about the formula. I think the formula is that the angle between two angle bisectors is equal to 90° plus half the measure of the third angle. So, in triangle ABC, if I have two angle bisectors, say from A and B, meeting at O, then angle AOB is 90° + (1/2)*angle ACB. That seems correct.Alternatively, I can derive this formula to be sure. Let me try that.In triangle ABC, the incenter O is where the angle bisectors meet. So, angle OAB is half of angle BAC, and angle OBA is half of angle ABC. Let me denote angle BAC as 2α and angle ABC as 2β. Then, angle OAB = α and angle OBA = β.In triangle AOB, the sum of angles is 180°, so:angle OAB + angle OBA + angle AOB = 180°.Substituting the known values:α + β + 125° = 180°.Therefore, α + β = 55°.Now, in triangle ABC, the sum of all angles is 180°, so:angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180°.Which is:2α + 2β + angle ACB = 180°.We already found that α + β = 55°, so 2(α + β) = 110°. Therefore:110° + angle ACB = 180°.Subtracting 110° from both sides:angle ACB = 70°.Okay, so that confirms my earlier result. So, angle ACB is 70 degrees.Wait, let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using properties of the incenter or some trigonometric identities.Alternatively, I can use the fact that in triangle AOB, we know angle AOB is 125°, and we can express angles OAB and OBA in terms of the angles of triangle ABC.As I did before, angle OAB is half of angle BAC, and angle OBA is half of angle ABC. So, angle OAB = (1/2) angle BAC and angle OBA = (1/2) angle ABC.Then, in triangle AOB, the sum of angles is 180°, so:(1/2) angle BAC + (1/2) angle ABC + 125° = 180°.Which simplifies to:(1/2)(angle BAC + angle ABC) = 55°.Therefore, angle BAC + angle ABC = 110°.Since the sum of all angles in triangle ABC is 180°, angle ACB = 180° - (angle BAC + angle ABC) = 180° - 110° = 70°.Yep, same result. So, I think 70 degrees is the correct answer.Just to make sure, let me think about the triangle. If angle ACB is 70°, then the other two angles sum to 110°, so each of them is less than 70°, which makes sense because angle AOB is 125°, which is more than 90°, so the incenter is inside the triangle, but the angle is obtuse, which is consistent with the triangle having an acute angle at C.Wait, actually, if angle ACB is 70°, which is acute, then the triangle is acute-angled. Hmm, but angle AOB is 125°, which is obtuse. So, in an acute-angled triangle, the incenter is inside the triangle, but the angle at the incenter can be obtuse. That seems okay.Alternatively, if angle ACB were obtuse, say more than 90°, then angle AOB would be more than 90° + 45° = 135°, which is not the case here since angle AOB is 125°, which is less than 135°. So, angle ACB must be less than 90°, which is consistent with 70°.So, all of this seems to check out. Therefore, I'm confident that angle ACB is 70 degrees.**Final Answer**The measure of angle ACB is boxed{70} degrees."},{"question":"The quadratic function ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), where ( a, b, c in mathbf{R} ) and ( a neq 0 ), satisfies the following conditions:1.

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me note down the given conditions for the quadratic function:1. ( f(-1) = 0 ): So when I plug in x = -1 into the quadratic, it equals zero. That means -1 is a root of the quadratic.2. For all real numbers x, ( f(x) geq x ): So the quadratic function is always above or equal to the line y = x.3. For x in (0, 2), ( f(x) leq frac{(x + 1)^2}{4} ): So between 0 and 2, the quadratic is below or equal to this specific quadratic function ( frac{(x + 1)^2}{4} ).Given these conditions, I need to find the minimum value of the product ( f(x_1)f(x_2)f(x_3) ) where each ( x_i ) is in (0, 2) and satisfies ( frac{1}{x_1} + frac{1}{x_2} + frac{1}{x_3} = 3 ).Alright, let's tackle the quadratic function first. Since it's a quadratic, and we know one of its roots is at x = -1, we can express it in the form ( f(x) = a(x + 1)(x - r) ), where r is the other root. But wait, actually, since it's a quadratic, it can have at most two roots. But condition 1 only gives us one root at x = -1. So maybe it's a double root? Or maybe the other root is somewhere else.But before that, let's consider condition 2: ( f(x) geq x ) for all x. That tells me that the quadratic is always above the line y = x. So, if I subtract x from both sides, I get ( f(x) - x geq 0 ) for all x. So, ( f(x) - x = ax^2 + (b - 1)x + c geq 0 ) for all x. Since this is a quadratic that is always non-negative, it must be that the leading coefficient is positive, and the discriminant is non-positive.So, for ( f(x) - x = ax^2 + (b - 1)x + c geq 0 ) for all x, we have:1. ( a > 0 ) (since the quadratic opens upwards)2. The discriminant ( D = (b - 1)^2 - 4ac leq 0 )That's one set of conditions.Now, condition 3: For x in (0, 2), ( f(x) leq frac{(x + 1)^2}{4} ). So, in this interval, the quadratic is bounded above by another quadratic. Let me write that as ( f(x) - frac{(x + 1)^2}{4} leq 0 ) for x in (0, 2).So, ( f(x) - frac{(x + 1)^2}{4} = ax^2 + bx + c - frac{x^2 + 2x + 1}{4} leq 0 ) for x in (0, 2).Simplify this:( ax^2 + bx + c - frac{1}{4}x^2 - frac{1}{2}x - frac{1}{4} leq 0 )Combine like terms:( (a - 1/4)x^2 + (b - 1/2)x + (c - 1/4) leq 0 ) for x in (0, 2).So, this quadratic is less than or equal to zero on the interval (0, 2). Hmm, that suggests that the quadratic ( (a - 1/4)x^2 + (b - 1/2)x + (c - 1/4) ) has roots at x = 0 and x = 2, because it's zero at the endpoints and negative in between. So, perhaps it can be written as ( kx(x - 2) ) where k is a positive constant? Because if it's negative between 0 and 2, then the quadratic opens upwards, so k must be positive.Wait, but let's think about it. If the quadratic is less than or equal to zero on (0, 2), it must touch the x-axis at x = 0 and x = 2, so it can be written as ( kx(x - 2) ) where k is positive because the quadratic opens upwards (since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive, so that it's negative between 0 and 2). So, equating:( (a - 1/4)x^2 + (b - 1/2)x + (c - 1/4) = kx(x - 2) )Expanding the right-hand side:( kx^2 - 2kx )So, comparing coefficients:1. Coefficient of ( x^2 ): ( a - 1/4 = k )2. Coefficient of x: ( b - 1/2 = -2k )3. Constant term: ( c - 1/4 = 0 ) (since the right-hand side has no constant term)From the constant term, we get ( c = 1/4 ).From the coefficient of x, ( b - 1/2 = -2k ) => ( b = -2k + 1/2 ).From the coefficient of ( x^2 ), ( a = k + 1/4 ).So, now we have expressions for a, b, c in terms of k.But we also know that ( f(-1) = 0 ). Let's use that condition.( f(-1) = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = a - b + c = 0 )Substituting a, b, c in terms of k:( (k + 1/4) - (-2k + 1/2) + (1/4) = 0 )Simplify:( k + 1/4 + 2k - 1/2 + 1/4 = 0 )Combine like terms:( (k + 2k) + (1/4 - 1/2 + 1/4) = 0 )( 3k + (0) = 0 )So, 3k = 0 => k = 0.Wait, but if k = 0, then a = 1/4, b = 1/2, c = 1/4.But hold on, earlier we had that ( (a - 1/4)x^2 + (b - 1/2)x + (c - 1/4) = kx(x - 2) ). If k = 0, then the left-hand side becomes 0, so ( (a - 1/4)x^2 + (b - 1/2)x + (c - 1/4) = 0 ) for all x in (0, 2). But that would mean that ( a = 1/4 ), ( b = 1/2 ), ( c = 1/4 ).So, f(x) = (1/4)x^2 + (1/2)x + 1/4.Let me check if this satisfies all the conditions.First, f(-1) = (1/4)(1) + (1/2)(-1) + 1/4 = 1/4 - 1/2 + 1/4 = 0. Okay, that works.Second, f(x) - x = (1/4)x^2 + (1/2)x + 1/4 - x = (1/4)x^2 - (1/2)x + 1/4.Let me compute the discriminant: D = (-1/2)^2 - 4*(1/4)*(1/4) = 1/4 - 1/4 = 0. So, discriminant is zero, which means f(x) - x is a perfect square, which is non-negative for all x. So that's good.Third, f(x) = (1/4)x^2 + (1/2)x + 1/4. Let's see if f(x) <= (x + 1)^2 /4 for x in (0, 2).Compute (x + 1)^2 /4 = (x^2 + 2x + 1)/4 = (1/4)x^2 + (1/2)x + 1/4. So, f(x) is exactly equal to (x + 1)^2 /4. So, f(x) = (x + 1)^2 /4 for all x. So, in particular, for x in (0, 2), f(x) = (x + 1)^2 /4, so the inequality is actually an equality. So, that works.So, the quadratic function is uniquely determined as f(x) = (x + 1)^2 /4.Wait, that's interesting. So, f(x) is exactly equal to (x + 1)^2 /4. So, in that case, for x in (0, 2), f(x) is equal to (x + 1)^2 /4, which is the upper bound given in condition 3. So, the function just touches that upper bound.So, now, moving on to the main problem: given ( x_1, x_2, x_3 in (0, 2) ) such that ( frac{1}{x_1} + frac{1}{x_2} + frac{1}{x_3} = 3 ), find the minimum value of ( f(x_1)f(x_2)f(x_3) ).Since f(x) = (x + 1)^2 /4, then ( f(x_i) = frac{(x_i + 1)^2}{4} ). So, the product becomes:( prod_{i=1}^3 f(x_i) = prod_{i=1}^3 frac{(x_i + 1)^2}{4} = left( frac{1}{4} right)^3 prod_{i=1}^3 (x_i + 1)^2 = frac{1}{64} left( prod_{i=1}^3 (x_i + 1) right)^2 ).So, to minimize ( f(x_1)f(x_2)f(x_3) ), it's equivalent to minimizing ( left( prod_{i=1}^3 (x_i + 1) right)^2 ), which in turn is equivalent to minimizing ( prod_{i=1}^3 (x_i + 1) ).So, let me define ( P = prod_{i=1}^3 (x_i + 1) ). Then, we need to minimize P, given that ( frac{1}{x_1} + frac{1}{x_2} + frac{1}{x_3} = 3 ) and each ( x_i in (0, 2) ).So, the problem reduces to minimizing ( P = (x_1 + 1)(x_2 + 1)(x_3 + 1) ) under the constraint ( frac{1}{x_1} + frac{1}{x_2} + frac{1}{x_3} = 3 ).Hmm, okay. So, perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but since it's symmetric in x1, x2, x3, maybe the minimum occurs when all x_i are equal.Let me test that. Suppose x1 = x2 = x3 = t. Then, the constraint becomes ( 3*(1/t) = 3 ) => 1/t = 1 => t = 1.So, if each x_i is 1, then P = (1 + 1)^3 = 8. So, the product is 8, and the square is 64, so ( f(x_1)f(x_2)f(x_3) = 64 / 64 = 1 ).Wait, no, wait. Wait, ( P = (x1 + 1)(x2 + 1)(x3 + 1) ). If each x_i is 1, then P = 2*2*2 = 8. Then, ( prod f(x_i) = (1/64)*(8)^2 = (1/64)*64 = 1 ). So, the product is 1.Is this the minimum? Maybe, but I need to check if it's possible to get a smaller product.Alternatively, perhaps when one of the x_i approaches 0, but since x_i is in (0, 2), approaching 0 would make 1/x_i approach infinity, which would violate the constraint ( frac{1}{x_1} + frac{1}{x_2} + frac{1}{x_3} = 3 ). So, if one x_i is very small, the others would have to be very large to compensate, but x_i can't exceed 2. So, perhaps the minimal occurs at x_i = 1.Alternatively, maybe not. Let's think about it.Let me consider using the AM-GM inequality. The constraint is ( frac{1}{x_1} + frac{1}{x_2} + frac{1}{x_3} = 3 ). Let me denote ( y_i = 1/x_i ), so the constraint becomes ( y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = 3 ), with each ( y_i geq 1/2 ) because ( x_i in (0, 2) ) implies ( y_i = 1/x_i > 1/2 ).Wait, actually, if ( x_i in (0, 2) ), then ( y_i = 1/x_i in (1/2, infty) ). But since the sum is 3, each y_i can't be too large. For example, if one y_i is 3, the others must be 0, but y_i must be greater than 1/2, so actually, each y_i is in (1/2, 3 - 2*(1/2)) = (1/2, 2). So, each y_i is in (1/2, 2).So, we have y1 + y2 + y3 = 3, with each y_i in (1/2, 2). We need to minimize ( P = (x1 + 1)(x2 + 1)(x3 + 1) ). Since x_i = 1/y_i, this becomes ( P = left( frac{1}{y1} + 1 right) left( frac{1}{y2} + 1 right) left( frac{1}{y3} + 1 right) ).So, ( P = prod_{i=1}^3 left( 1 + frac{1}{y_i} right) ).We need to minimize this product given that y1 + y2 + y3 = 3 and each y_i is in (1/2, 2).Hmm, perhaps we can use the AM-GM inequality or some other inequality here.Alternatively, maybe we can use substitution. Let me consider substituting variables.Let me denote ( z_i = y_i ). So, z1 + z2 + z3 = 3, with each z_i in (1/2, 2). We need to minimize ( prod_{i=1}^3 left(1 + frac{1}{z_i}right) ).Alternatively, maybe taking logarithms to turn the product into a sum. Let me try that.Let me define ( ln P = sum_{i=1}^3 ln left(1 + frac{1}{z_i}right) ). So, to minimize P, we can minimize ( ln P ).So, we can set up the Lagrangian:( mathcal{L} = sum_{i=1}^3 ln left(1 + frac{1}{z_i}right) + lambda left(3 - sum_{i=1}^3 z_i right) ).Taking partial derivatives with respect to z_i:( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial z_i} = frac{-1}{z_i^2 + z_i} - lambda = 0 ).So, for each i, ( frac{-1}{z_i(z_i + 1)} = lambda ).Which implies that ( frac{1}{z_i(z_i + 1)} ) is constant for all i. So, ( z_1 = z_2 = z_3 ).Therefore, the minimum occurs when all z_i are equal. So, z1 = z2 = z3 = 1.Therefore, y1 = y2 = y3 = 1, so x1 = x2 = x3 = 1.Therefore, the minimal value of P is (1 + 1)^3 = 8, so the minimal value of ( f(x_1)f(x_2)f(x_3) ) is ( (1/64)*(8)^2 = 1 ).Wait, but hold on, is this the minimum? Because sometimes when you use Lagrangian multipliers, you might get a maximum or a saddle point. So, I need to verify if this is indeed a minimum.Alternatively, let's consider the function ( f(z) = ln(1 + 1/z) ). The second derivative would tell us about concavity. Let's compute it.First derivative: ( f'(z) = frac{-1}{z(z + 1)} ).Second derivative: ( f''(z) = frac{2z + 1}{z^2(z + 1)^2} ), which is positive for z > 0. So, the function is convex. Therefore, by Jensen's inequality, the minimum occurs at the endpoints or when variables are equal.But since we have the constraint z1 + z2 + z3 = 3, and the function is convex, the minimum occurs at the corners, but in this case, due to the convexity, the minimum is achieved when all variables are equal because of the symmetry.Wait, actually, for convex functions, Jensen's inequality states that the average of the function is greater than or equal to the function of the average. So, in this case, since f is convex, ( frac{f(z1) + f(z2) + f(z3)}{3} geq fleft( frac{z1 + z2 + z3}{3} right) ). So, ( ln P = f(z1) + f(z2) + f(z3) geq 3 f(1) ). Therefore, the minimum occurs when all z_i = 1, so P is minimized when z_i = 1.Therefore, the minimal value is indeed 8, so ( f(x_1)f(x_2)f(x_3) = 1 ).Wait, but hold on, let me test with another set of values to see if P can be smaller.Suppose I take x1 approaching 2, so y1 approaching 1/2, then x2 and x3 must adjust so that y2 + y3 = 3 - 1/2 = 5/2.Suppose x1 = 2 - ε, so y1 = 1/(2 - ε) ≈ 1/2 + ε/4 for small ε.Then, y2 + y3 = 5/2 - ε/4.To minimize P, which is (x1 + 1)(x2 + 1)(x3 + 1), let's see.If x1 approaches 2, then x1 + 1 approaches 3.Then, x2 and x3 would be such that y2 + y3 = 5/2 - ε/4.If we set y2 = y3 = (5/2 - ε/4)/2 ≈ 5/4 - ε/8.So, x2 ≈ 1/(5/4 - ε/8) ≈ 4/5 + (ε/8)/(25/16) ) ≈ 4/5 + something small.So, x2 + 1 ≈ 4/5 + 1 = 9/5, similarly for x3.So, P ≈ 3 * (9/5)^2 = 3*(81/25) = 243/25 ≈ 9.72, which is larger than 8.So, in this case, P is larger.Alternatively, let's take x1 approaching 0, but x1 can't be zero, but approaching zero, y1 approaches infinity, which would violate the constraint y1 + y2 + y3 = 3. So, that's not possible.Alternatively, take x1 = 1.5, so y1 = 2/3.Then, y2 + y3 = 3 - 2/3 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333.Suppose y2 = y3 = 7/6 ≈ 1.1667, so x2 = x3 ≈ 6/7 ≈ 0.857.Then, P = (1.5 + 1)(0.857 + 1)^2 ≈ 2.5 * (1.857)^2 ≈ 2.5 * 3.45 ≈ 8.625, which is still larger than 8.So, seems like when variables are equal, P is minimized.Alternatively, take x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, then P = 8.If I take x1 = 0.5, which is allowed since 0.5 is in (0, 2). Then y1 = 2.Then, y2 + y3 = 3 - 2 = 1.So, y2 = y3 = 0.5, so x2 = x3 = 2.But x2 and x3 can't be 2, since they have to be in (0, 2). So, approaching 2.So, x2 and x3 approaching 2, so x2 + 1 and x3 + 1 approaching 3.So, P approaches (0.5 + 1)*3*3 = 1.5*9 = 13.5, which is larger than 8.So, again, P is larger.Alternatively, take x1 = 1. Let me see, if I take x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, then P = 8.If I take x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, it's symmetric.Alternatively, take x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, which gives the minimal P.Alternatively, take x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, which gives P = 8.Alternatively, take x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, which gives P = 8.So, seems like the minimal P is 8, so the minimal value of ( f(x_1)f(x_2)f(x_3) ) is 1.Wait, but let me confirm.Wait, f(x) = (x + 1)^2 /4. So, f(1) = (2)^2 /4 = 1. So, f(1) = 1.Therefore, if x1 = x2 = x3 = 1, then the product is 1*1*1 = 1.But is this the minimal value? Because if I take other points, for example, x1 = 0.5, x2 = 0.5, x3 = something.Wait, let me compute.Suppose x1 = x2 = 0.5, then y1 = y2 = 2, so y3 = 3 - 4 = -1, which is not allowed because y3 must be positive. So, that's not possible.Alternatively, x1 = x2 = 0.6, so y1 = y2 ≈ 1.6667, so y3 = 3 - 3.333 ≈ negative, which is not allowed.Wait, so if I take x1 and x2 less than 1, y1 and y2 would be greater than 1, so y3 would have to be less than 3 - 2*(1) = 1, so y3 < 1, which would mean x3 > 1.Wait, let me take x1 = x2 = t, so y1 = y2 = 1/t, and y3 = 3 - 2/t.So, to have y3 > 0, 3 - 2/t > 0 => 2/t < 3 => t > 2/3.So, t must be in (2/3, 2).So, let's take t = 1, which gives y3 = 1, x3 = 1.Alternatively, take t = 0.8, so y1 = y2 = 1.25, y3 = 3 - 2.5 = 0.5, so x3 = 2.But x3 can't be 2, so approaching 2.So, P = (0.8 + 1)^2 * (2 + 1) ≈ (1.8)^2 * 3 ≈ 3.24 * 3 ≈ 9.72, which is larger than 8.Alternatively, take t = 1.5, y1 = y2 ≈ 0.6667, y3 = 3 - 1.333 ≈ 1.6667, so x3 ≈ 0.6.So, P = (1.5 + 1)^2 * (0.6 + 1) ≈ (2.5)^2 * 1.6 ≈ 6.25 * 1.6 ≈ 10, which is still larger than 8.So, seems like when x1 = x2 = x3 = 1, P is minimized.Alternatively, let's take x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, which gives P = 8.Alternatively, take x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, which gives P = 8.So, seems like the minimal value is indeed 1.Wait, but let me think again. Since f(x) = (x + 1)^2 /4, which is a convex function? Wait, f(x) is a quadratic, so it's convex.But in the interval (0, 2), f(x) is convex, so the product of convex functions... Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe using the AM-GM inequality on the terms (x_i + 1).Wait, the product (x1 + 1)(x2 + 1)(x3 + 1) is to be minimized, given that 1/x1 + 1/x2 + 1/x3 = 3.But I don't see a direct way to apply AM-GM here.Alternatively, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.Wait, let me consider the following:We have ( sum frac{1}{x_i} = 3 ), and we need to minimize ( prod (x_i + 1) ).Let me take the logarithm:( ln prod (x_i + 1) = sum ln(x_i + 1) ).We need to minimize this sum given ( sum frac{1}{x_i} = 3 ).This is similar to optimizing a function with constraints.Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers as I did before.But I already did that, and found that the minimal occurs when all x_i are equal to 1.Therefore, the minimal value of the product is 8, so the minimal value of ( f(x_1)f(x_2)f(x_3) ) is 1.Therefore, I think the answer is 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"On a plane, three lines intersect pairwise. The maximum number of intersection points is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"On a plane, three lines intersect pairwise. The maximum number of intersection points is ______.\\" Hmm, I need to figure out the maximum number of points where these three lines can intersect each other. Let me think about this step by step.First, I remember that when two lines intersect, they meet at a single point, right? So, if I have two lines, they can intersect at one point. But now, there are three lines. I need to see how these three lines can intersect each other in such a way that the number of intersection points is maximized.Let me visualize this. Imagine drawing three lines on a piece of paper. The first two lines will intersect at one point. Now, where should I draw the third line so that it intersects the other two lines at different points? If I draw the third line in such a way that it crosses both of the first two lines, but not at the same point where the first two lines intersect, then each intersection will be a unique point.Wait, so if the third line intersects each of the first two lines at separate points, that would add two more intersection points. So, the first two lines give one intersection, and the third line adds two more. That would make a total of three intersection points.But hold on, is that the maximum? Let me make sure. If all three lines intersect at the same point, then there would only be one intersection point. But that's the minimum, not the maximum. So, to get the maximum, I need each pair of lines to intersect at a different point.So, with three lines, each pair can intersect once. How many pairs are there? Let me count. The first line can pair with the second, the first with the third, and the second with the third. That's three pairs. So, each pair can contribute one intersection point. Therefore, the maximum number of intersection points should be three.Let me double-check this. If I have three lines, each pair intersects once, and none of the intersections coincide. So, three lines, three intersection points. That seems right.Wait, is there a way to have more than three intersection points with three lines? Hmm, I don't think so because each line can only intersect another line once. So, with three lines, each line can intersect the other two lines once each, but since each intersection is shared between two lines, the total number of unique intersections is three.Let me think of an example. Suppose I have three lines: line A, line B, and line C. Line A and line B intersect at point P. Line A and line C intersect at point Q. Line B and line C intersect at point R. So, points P, Q, and R are all distinct. That gives me three intersection points.If I try to make a fourth intersection point, I would need another pair of lines, but I only have three lines. So, it's not possible. Therefore, three is the maximum number of intersection points.I think I'm confident now. The maximum number of intersection points when three lines intersect pairwise is three.**Final Answer**The maximum number of intersection points is boxed{3}."},{"question":"A high school senior class conducted a simulated college entrance exam. The math scores of this test follow a normal distribution Xsim N(90,delta ^{2}), and Pleft(X lt 60right)=0.1. It is defined that a score higher than 120 is considered excellent. If 1200 senior students participated in the test, the number of students who scored excellent in math is ____.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a high school senior class taking a simulated college entrance exam. The math scores are normally distributed, which is denoted as X ~ N(90, δ²). That means the mean score is 90, and the variance is δ squared. They also mention that the probability of scoring less than 60 is 0.1, which is 10%. Then, they define an excellent score as anything higher than 120. There are 1200 students who took the test, and we need to find out how many of them scored excellent in math.Okay, so let me break this down step by step. First, since the scores are normally distributed, I know that the distribution is symmetric around the mean, which is 90. The standard deviation is δ, but we don't know its value yet. The problem gives us a probability: P(X < 60) = 0.1. I can use this information to find δ.To find δ, I need to use the properties of the normal distribution. In a normal distribution, the probability that a variable is less than a certain value can be found using the z-score. The z-score is calculated as (X - μ)/σ, where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation (which is δ in this case).So, let's write that down. For X = 60, the z-score would be (60 - 90)/δ. That simplifies to (-30)/δ. Now, we know that P(X < 60) = 0.1, which means that the probability that Z is less than (-30)/δ is 0.1. I remember that in the standard normal distribution table, the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.1 is approximately -1.28. So, we can set up the equation:(-30)/δ = -1.28Solving for δ, we can multiply both sides by δ:-30 = -1.28δThen, divide both sides by -1.28:δ = 30 / 1.28Let me calculate that. 30 divided by 1.28. Hmm, 1.28 times 23 is about 29.44, and 1.28 times 23.4375 is exactly 30 because 1.28 * 23.4375 = 30. So, δ is approximately 23.4375. Let me write that as δ ≈ 23.44 for simplicity.Now that we have the standard deviation, we can figure out the probability that a student scores excellent, which is higher than 120. So, we need to find P(X > 120). Again, we'll use the z-score formula.For X = 120, the z-score is (120 - 90)/δ. Plugging in δ ≈ 23.44, that becomes (30)/23.44 ≈ 1.28.So, the z-score is approximately 1.28. Now, we need to find the probability that Z is greater than 1.28. Since the total area under the normal curve is 1, and the area to the left of Z = 1.28 is the cumulative probability up to that point. From the standard normal distribution table, the cumulative probability for Z = 1.28 is approximately 0.8997. Therefore, the area to the right of Z = 1.28 is 1 - 0.8997 = 0.1003.So, P(X > 120) ≈ 0.1003, which is about 10.03%. Now, since there are 1200 students, the expected number of students who scored excellent is 1200 multiplied by 0.1003. Let me compute that:1200 * 0.1003 = 1200 * 0.1 + 1200 * 0.0003 = 120 + 0.36 = 120.36.Since the number of students must be an integer, we can round this to the nearest whole number. 120.36 is approximately 120 students.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 0.1003 is approximately 10%, so 10% of 1200 is 120. So, that seems consistent.But just to make sure, let me verify the z-score calculations. For X = 60, z = (60 - 90)/23.44 ≈ -1.28, which corresponds to 0.10 probability. That seems correct because a z-score of -1.28 is indeed associated with a cumulative probability of about 0.10.Similarly, for X = 120, z ≈ 1.28, which gives a cumulative probability of about 0.90, so the area above is 0.10. So, 10% of 1200 is 120. So, that seems right.But just to be thorough, let me compute δ more precisely. Earlier, I approximated δ as 23.44, but let me do the exact division of 30 / 1.28.30 divided by 1.28:1.28 goes into 30 how many times?1.28 * 23 = 29.4430 - 29.44 = 0.56Bring down a zero: 5.61.28 goes into 5.6 approximately 4 times because 1.28 * 4 = 5.12Subtract: 5.6 - 5.12 = 0.48Bring down another zero: 4.81.28 goes into 4.8 exactly 3.75 times because 1.28 * 3.75 = 4.8So, putting it all together, 30 / 1.28 = 23.4375So, δ = 23.4375So, when we compute the z-score for X = 120, it's (120 - 90)/23.4375 = 30 / 23.4375 = 1.28 exactly.So, that's precise. So, the z-score is exactly 1.28, which as we know, corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.8997, so the area above is 0.1003.Therefore, the exact probability is 0.1003, so 0.1003 * 1200 = 120.36, which is approximately 120 students.But wait, 0.1003 is just slightly more than 0.1, so 0.1003 * 1200 is 120.36, which is 120.36 students. Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to round this. Depending on the convention, sometimes we round to the nearest whole number, so 120.36 would round to 120. Alternatively, sometimes in such contexts, they might expect you to use the exact value without rounding, but since 0.36 is less than 0.5, it would still round down.Alternatively, maybe the exact calculation is needed. Let me compute 0.1003 * 1200 precisely.0.1 * 1200 = 1200.0003 * 1200 = 0.36So, total is 120 + 0.36 = 120.36So, 120.36 students. Since we can't have a fraction, it's either 120 or 121. But in most cases, unless specified otherwise, we round to the nearest whole number, so 120.36 would round to 120.But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to interpret this. Maybe using more precise z-scores or something else.Wait, another thought: when we found δ, we used the z-score of -1.28 for P(X < 60) = 0.1. But is that exact? Because sometimes, the z-score for 0.1 is actually -1.28155, which is approximately -1.28, but slightly more precise. So, maybe using a more precise z-score would give a slightly different δ.Let me check the exact z-score for 0.1. Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.1 is approximately -1.2815515655446008. So, let's use that more precise value.So, z = -1.2815515655446008So, (60 - 90)/δ = -1.2815515655446008So, -30 / δ = -1.2815515655446008Therefore, δ = 30 / 1.2815515655446008Let me compute that.30 divided by 1.2815515655446008.Let me compute 1.2815515655446008 * 23.4375 = ?Wait, 1.2815515655446008 * 23.4375.Compute 1.2815515655446008 * 23 = 29.4756851.2815515655446008 * 0.4375 = approximately 0.5617So, total is approximately 29.475685 + 0.5617 ≈ 30.0374Wait, so 1.2815515655446008 * 23.4375 ≈ 30.0374, which is slightly more than 30. So, to get δ such that 1.2815515655446008 * δ = 30, we need δ = 30 / 1.2815515655446008 ≈ 23.4375 - a bit less.Wait, let me compute 30 / 1.2815515655446008.Compute 1.2815515655446008 * 23.4375 ≈ 30.0374, which is a bit over 30. So, to get exactly 30, we need δ slightly less than 23.4375.Let me compute 30 / 1.2815515655446008.Using a calculator:1.2815515655446008 goes into 30 how many times?1.2815515655446008 * 23 = 29.475685Subtract that from 30: 30 - 29.475685 = 0.524315Now, 1.2815515655446008 goes into 0.524315 approximately 0.524315 / 1.2815515655446008 ≈ 0.409 times.So, total δ ≈ 23 + 0.409 ≈ 23.409So, δ ≈ 23.409So, more precisely, δ ≈ 23.409So, now, let's compute the z-score for X = 120.z = (120 - 90)/23.409 ≈ 30 / 23.409 ≈ 1.2815515655446008Wait, that's interesting. So, z ≈ 1.2815515655446008, which is the exact z-score for the 90th percentile.Therefore, the cumulative probability up to z = 1.2815515655446008 is 0.90, so the area above is 0.10.So, P(X > 120) = 0.10 exactly.Therefore, the probability is exactly 0.10, so 10% of 1200 students is 120 students.So, that's the answer.Wait, so even though we used a more precise z-score, it turned out that the probability is exactly 0.10, so 10% of 1200 is 120.Therefore, the number of students who scored excellent is 120.So, that seems consistent.But just to recap:1. Given X ~ N(90, δ²), P(X < 60) = 0.1.2. Convert X = 60 to z-score: z = (60 - 90)/δ = -30/δ.3. From standard normal table, z = -1.28155 corresponds to P(Z < z) = 0.1.4. Therefore, -30/δ = -1.28155 => δ = 30 / 1.28155 ≈ 23.409.5. Then, for X = 120, z = (120 - 90)/23.409 ≈ 1.28155.6. From standard normal table, P(Z < 1.28155) = 0.90, so P(Z > 1.28155) = 0.10.7. Therefore, P(X > 120) = 0.10.8. Number of students = 0.10 * 1200 = 120.So, yeah, 120 students.I think that's solid. I considered both the approximate and precise z-scores, and in both cases, it led me to the same conclusion. So, I feel confident that the answer is 120.**Final Answer**The number of students who scored excellent in math is boxed{120}."},{"question":"Xiaoming's living room needs to be tiled.

Since using 0.3-meter side length tiles requires 500 tiles, I can calculate the total area by multiplying the area of one tile by the number of tiles.The area of one 0.3-meter tile is 0.3 meters multiplied by 0.3 meters, which equals 0.09 square meters.

It says that in the sequence {a_n}, the sum of the third term and the eleventh term is 22, and I need to find the seventh term. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how arithmetic sequences work.First off, I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term. So, if I denote the first term as a_1 and the common difference as d, then the nth term can be written as:a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)dYeah, that sounds right. So, for example, the third term would be a_3 = a_1 + 2d, and the eleventh term would be a_11 = a_1 + 10d. Got that down.The problem states that a_3 + a_11 = 22. Let me write that out using the formula I just recalled. So,a_3 + a_11 = (a_1 + 2d) + (a_1 + 10d) = 22Let me simplify that equation. Combining like terms:a_1 + a_1 + 2d + 10d = 22  2a_1 + 12d = 22Hmm, okay, so that's 2a_1 + 12d = 22. I can factor out a 2 from the left side:2(a_1 + 6d) = 22Dividing both sides by 2:a_1 + 6d = 11Wait a second, a_1 + 6d is actually the seventh term of the sequence, right? Because a_7 = a_1 + (7 - 1)d = a_1 + 6d. So, that means a_7 = 11.Oh, that's neat! So, without even needing to find a_1 or d individually, I can directly find a_7 by recognizing that the sum of a_3 and a_11 gives me twice the seventh term. That makes sense because in an arithmetic sequence, the terms are equally spaced, so the average of the third and eleventh terms should be the middle term between them, which is the seventh term.Let me double-check that logic to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake. So, starting from the beginning:1. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d.2. Therefore, a_3 = a_1 + 2d and a_11 = a_1 + 10d.3. Adding them together: a_3 + a_11 = (a_1 + 2d) + (a_1 + 10d) = 2a_1 + 12d.4. Simplify: 2a_1 + 12d = 22.5. Factor out a 2: 2(a_1 + 6d) = 22.6. Divide by 2: a_1 + 6d = 11.7. Recognize that a_1 + 6d is a_7.Yep, that all checks out. So, a_7 is 11. I think that's the answer. It seems straightforward once I break it down step by step. I didn't have to solve for a_1 or d separately, which is nice because sometimes those can be tricky to find without more information. But in this case, the problem gave me just enough to find the middle term directly.Just to visualize it another way, if I think about the positions of the terms: the third term is three terms after the first, and the eleventh term is eleven terms after the first. The seventh term is exactly halfway between the third and eleventh terms. Since it's an arithmetic sequence, the terms increase linearly, so the average of the third and eleventh terms should be equal to the seventh term. That's another way to see why a_7 is 11.Let me also consider if there's another approach, maybe using the properties of arithmetic sequences. I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, the sum of two terms equidistant from the ends is constant. But in this case, the third and eleventh terms aren't necessarily equidistant from the ends unless we know the total number of terms, which we don't. So, maybe that property isn't directly applicable here.Alternatively, I could think about the sequence in terms of the middle term. Since a_3 and a_11 are symmetric around a_7, their average is a_7. So, (a_3 + a_11)/2 = a_7. Plugging in the given sum:(22)/2 = a_7  11 = a_7Yep, same result. That's a quicker way to get there, recognizing the symmetry in the sequence. It all ties back to the fact that arithmetic sequences have a linear nature, so the terms are evenly spaced, making such symmetries possible.I guess another way to look at it is by considering the number of terms between a_3 and a_11. From term 3 to term 11, there are 8 intervals, meaning 9 terms in total. The middle term of these would be the 6th term from a_3, which is a_3 + 6d. But wait, a_3 + 6d is a_9, right? Hmm, that seems conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Wait, maybe I messed up the counting.Wait, from a_3 to a_11, how many terms is that? Let's count: a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11. That's 9 terms. So, the middle term is the 5th term in this list, which is a_7. So, the average of a_3 and a_11 is a_7. So, yeah, that still holds. So, (a_3 + a_11)/2 = a_7.I think I confused myself for a moment there, but clarifying the number of terms helped me see that a_7 is indeed the middle term between a_3 and a_11. So, the average is correct.Just to recap, since arithmetic sequences have a constant difference, the terms are evenly spread out. So, the average of two terms equidistant from a central point will be equal to that central term. In this case, a_3 and a_11 are equidistant from a_7, so their average is a_7.So, in summary, whether I approach it by expanding the terms using the formula, or by recognizing the symmetry and using the average, I end up with a_7 = 11. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.I don't think I made any calculation errors here, but just to be thorough, let me plug some numbers in. Suppose a_1 is 1 and d is 2. Then, a_3 would be 1 + 2*2 = 5, and a_11 would be 1 + 10*2 = 21. Adding those together, 5 + 21 = 26, which isn't 22. Hmm, so that doesn't satisfy the condition. Let me try another set.Suppose a_1 is 5 and d is 1. Then, a_3 = 5 + 2*1 = 7, and a_11 = 5 + 10*1 = 15. Adding those, 7 + 15 = 22. Perfect, that works. Then, a_7 would be 5 + 6*1 = 11. Yep, that matches.Another example: Let a_1 be 2 and d be 1.5. Then, a_3 = 2 + 2*1.5 = 5, and a_11 = 2 + 10*1.5 = 17. Adding those, 5 + 17 = 22. Then, a_7 = 2 + 6*1.5 = 11. Again, it works.So, through these examples, it seems consistent that a_7 is 11 when a_3 + a_11 = 22. Therefore, I can confidently say that the seventh term is 11.**Final Answer**The seventh term is boxed{11}."},{"question":"The ratio of the number of big dogs to the number of small dogs at a pet show is 3:17.

The ratio of big dogs to small dogs is 3:17, which means there are 3 parts of big dogs and 17 parts of small dogs. Adding these together, the total number of parts is 3 + 17 = 20 parts.Next, I'll find the value of one part by dividing the total number of dogs by the total number of parts. There are 80 dogs in total, so one part is equal to 80 ÷ 20 = 4 dogs.Finally, to find the number of big dogs, I'll multiply the number of parts for big dogs by the value of one part.

Each day he must take two more pills than the previous day.

This forms an arithmetic sequence where the first term (a₁) is 1 and the common difference (d) is 2.To find the total number of pills Joey takes in a week, I need to calculate the sum of the first seven terms of this sequence. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is Sₙ = n/2 × (2a₁ + (n - 1)d).Plugging in the values, n is 7, a₁ is 1, and d is 2. This gives S₇ = 7/2 × (2 × 1 + (7 - 1) × 2) = 7/2 × (2 + 12) = 7/2 × 14 = 49.Therefore, Joey will take a total of 49 pills in a week."},{"question":"Let bold{v} = begin{pmatrix} 5  -3 end{pmatrix} and bold{w} = begin{pmatrix} 11  -2 end{pmatrix}.  Find the area of the parallelogram with vertices bold{0}, bold{v}, bold{w}, and bold{v} + bold{w}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of a parallelogram. The vertices of the parallelogram are given as the origin, vector v, vector w, and the sum of vectors v and w. The vectors are v = [5, -3] and w = [11, -2]. Hmm, I remember that the area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors can be found using the cross product. But wait, cross product is typically in three dimensions, right? Since these vectors are in two dimensions, I think there's a way to adapt the cross product formula for 2D vectors.Let me recall. In two dimensions, if I have vectors v = [v1, v2] and w = [w1, w2], the area of the parallelogram they form is the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix formed by these vectors. The determinant is calculated as (v1*w2 - v2*w1). So, the area should be |v1*w2 - v2*w1|. That makes sense because the determinant gives the area scaling factor of the linear transformation represented by the matrix, which in this case is the parallelogram area.Alright, so let me write down the formula:Area = |v1*w2 - v2*w1|Plugging in the values from vectors v and w:v1 is 5, v2 is -3, w1 is 11, and w2 is -2.So, substituting these into the formula:Area = |(5)*(-2) - (-3)*(11)|Let me compute each part step by step.First, 5 times -2 is -10.Then, -3 times 11 is -33. But since it's subtracting that term, it becomes -(-33), which is +33.So, putting it all together:Area = |-10 + 33|Compute inside the absolute value:-10 + 33 is 23.So, the absolute value of 23 is just 23.Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is 23.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, the determinant formula: yes, it's v1*w2 - v2*w1.So, 5*(-2) is indeed -10.Then, -3*11 is -33, but since it's subtracting that, it's -(-33) which is +33.So, -10 + 33 is 23. Absolute value is 23. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can visualize this to make sure. If I plot the vectors v and w, the parallelogram would be formed by these two vectors emanating from the origin. The area should be the base times the height, but since it's a parallelogram, it's a bit more involved than a rectangle.But since I used the determinant method, which is a standard way to calculate the area, I think that should be correct.Alternatively, I can think of the vectors as sides of the parallelogram, and the area is the magnitude of their cross product. In 3D, the cross product of two vectors gives a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram. But in 2D, we can treat the vectors as lying in the xy-plane, so their cross product would be along the z-axis, and the magnitude would just be the scalar value we calculated.So, if I consider v and w as 3D vectors with z-components zero, then their cross product would be:v × w = |i   j   k|         |5   -3   0|         |11  -2   0|Calculating this determinant:i*( (-3)(0) - (0)(-2) ) - j*(5*0 - 0*11) + k*(5*(-2) - (-3)*11)Simplify each component:i*(0 - 0) - j*(0 - 0) + k*(-10 - (-33))Which simplifies to:0i - 0j + ( -10 + 33 )k = 23kSo, the cross product vector is [0, 0, 23], and its magnitude is sqrt(0^2 + 0^2 + 23^2) = 23. So, that confirms the area is 23.Therefore, I'm confident that the area is 23.**Final Answer**The area of the parallelogram is boxed{23}."},{"question":"Given vectors overrightarrow {a}=(1,2), overrightarrow {b}=(0,-1), overrightarrow {c}=(k,-2), if (overrightarrow {a}-2overrightarrow {b}) perp overrightarrow {c}, then the real number k= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with vectors. Let me read it again: Given vectors a = (1,2), b = (0,-1), c = (k,-2). If (a - 2b) is perpendicular to c, then find the real number k. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the value of k such that the vector (a - 2b) is perpendicular to vector c.Alright, let me recall some vector properties. I remember that two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is zero. So, if (a - 2b) is perpendicular to c, then their dot product should be zero. That gives me an equation to solve for k.First, let me compute the vector (a - 2b). Vector a is (1,2), and vector b is (0,-1). So, 2b would be 2 times each component of b, right? So, 2b = (0*2, -1*2) = (0, -2). Then, subtracting 2b from a, which is a - 2b. So, a is (1,2) minus (0,-2). Let me compute that.Subtracting component-wise: 1 - 0 = 1, and 2 - (-2) = 2 + 2 = 4. So, a - 2b is (1,4). Okay, so that vector is (1,4).Now, vector c is given as (k, -2). So, I need to compute the dot product of (a - 2b) and c, which is (1,4) · (k, -2). The dot product is calculated as (1*k) + (4*(-2)). So, that would be k - 8.Since these vectors are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So, k - 8 = 0. Solving for k, I add 8 to both sides: k = 8.Wait, is that all? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, compute 2b: 2*(0,-1) = (0,-2). Correct. Then, a - 2b: (1,2) - (0,-2) = (1,4). That seems right. Then, vector c is (k,-2). Dot product: (1)(k) + (4)(-2) = k - 8. Setting that equal to zero: k - 8 = 0, so k = 8. Yeah, that seems solid.Just to make sure, let me visualize it. Vector a is (1,2), which is in the first quadrant. Vector b is (0,-1), pointing straight down. So, 2b is (0,-2), which is twice as long but still pointing down. Subtracting 2b from a is like adding a vector pointing up 2 units in the y-direction. So, (1,2) + (0,2) = (1,4). That makes sense.Vector c is (k,-2). So, it's pointing somewhere in the fourth quadrant if k is positive, or second quadrant if k is negative. The fact that (1,4) is perpendicular to (k,-2) means that they form a right angle. So, their slopes should be negative reciprocals. Let me check that as another way.The slope of vector (1,4) is 4/1 = 4. The slope of vector (k,-2) is (-2)/k. For them to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, 4 * (-2/k) = -8/k. Setting that equal to -1: -8/k = -1. Multiply both sides by k: -8 = -k. So, k = 8. Yep, same result.Alright, so both methods give me k = 8. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The real number ( k ) is boxed{8}."},{"question":"A dealer sold 200 cars, and the data for some of those sales are recorded in this table.

Find f(2009).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to define a function ( f(x) ) on all real numbers. The function has two conditions: for any ( x ), it must satisfy ( f(x+4) leq f(x) + 4 ) and ( f(x+3) geq f(x) + 3 ). Additionally, I know that ( f(1) = 2 ) and ( f(0) = 1 ). The goal is to find ( f(2009) ).Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step. First, the function has these inequalities involving shifts by 3 and 4 units. That makes me think about periodicity or maybe linear functions. Since the shifts are by 3 and 4, which are coprime, maybe there's a way to combine these to get a linear function?Let me write down the given conditions:1. ( f(x + 4) leq f(x) + 4 ) for all ( x ).2. ( f(x + 3) geq f(x) + 3 ) for all ( x ).3. ( f(0) = 1 ).4. ( f(1) = 2 ).I need to find ( f(2009) ). Since 2009 is a large number, maybe I can express it in terms of multiples of 3 and 4, using the given inequalities to build up the function's value.Let me think about the inequalities. The first one says that shifting by 4 increases the function by at most 4, and the second says shifting by 3 increases it by at least 3. So, over shifts of 4, the function can't increase too much, but over shifts of 3, it has to increase by a certain amount.Wait, maybe if I consider both inequalities together, I can find that the function must be linear? Let me test that idea.Suppose ( f(x) = ax + b ). Then, substituting into the inequalities:1. ( a(x + 4) + b leq ax + b + 4 ) simplifies to ( 4a leq 4 ), so ( a leq 1 ).2. ( a(x + 3) + b geq ax + b + 3 ) simplifies to ( 3a geq 3 ), so ( a geq 1 ).Therefore, ( a = 1 ). So, the function must be linear with slope 1. That is, ( f(x) = x + b ).Now, let's use the given values to find ( b ). We know that ( f(0) = 1 ). Plugging into the equation:( f(0) = 0 + b = 1 ) implies ( b = 1 ).So, ( f(x) = x + 1 ). Let me check if this satisfies all the given conditions.First, check ( f(x + 4) leq f(x) + 4 ):( f(x + 4) = (x + 4) + 1 = x + 5 ).( f(x) + 4 = (x + 1) + 4 = x + 5 ).So, ( x + 5 leq x + 5 ), which is true.Next, check ( f(x + 3) geq f(x) + 3 ):( f(x + 3) = (x + 3) + 1 = x + 4 ).( f(x) + 3 = (x + 1) + 3 = x + 4 ).So, ( x + 4 geq x + 4 ), which is also true.Great, so the function ( f(x) = x + 1 ) satisfies both inequalities and the given values. Therefore, it must be the function we're looking for.Now, to find ( f(2009) ):( f(2009) = 2009 + 1 = 2010 ).Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Is there a possibility that the function isn't linear? Maybe there's a non-linear function that also satisfies the inequalities?Let me think. Suppose ( f(x) ) is not linear. Then, the inequalities might allow for some fluctuations, but given that the inequalities are tight (i.e., ( f(x + 4) leq f(x) + 4 ) and ( f(x + 3) geq f(x) + 3 )), any deviation from linearity would cause a contradiction.For example, if ( f(x) ) were to sometimes increase more than 1 per unit, then the ( f(x + 4) leq f(x) + 4 ) condition would be violated. Similarly, if it sometimes increases less than 1 per unit, the ( f(x + 3) geq f(x) + 3 ) condition would be violated.Therefore, the function must increase exactly by 1 for each unit increase in ( x ). Hence, ( f(x) = x + 1 ) is indeed the only function that satisfies all the given conditions.So, computing ( f(2009) ) is just ( 2009 + 1 = 2010 ).I think that's solid. I don't see any loopholes or alternative functions that could satisfy the conditions without being linear. So, I'm confident that ( f(2009) = 2010 ).**Final Answer**boxed{2010}"},{"question":"Brittany is older than Rebecca by 3 years, who is 25. Brittany goes on a 4-year vacation.

Hmm, interesting. I remember that ( arccos x ) and ( arcsin x ) are related; specifically, ( arccos x + arcsin x = frac{pi}{2} ). Maybe that identity will come in handy here.Let me note that down:arccos x + arcsin x = frac{pi}{2}So, if I let ( y = arccos x ), then ( arcsin x = frac{pi}{2} - y ). That might simplify things a bit. Let me try substituting that into the expression for ( x_n ).Given ( x_n = frac{4}{pi^2} left( arccos x_{n-1} + frac{pi}{2} right) cdot arcsin x_{n-1} ), substituting the identity gives:x_n = frac{4}{pi^2} left( y + frac{pi}{2} right) cdot left( frac{pi}{2} - y right)where ( y = arccos x_{n-1} ).Let me compute that product:left( y + frac{pi}{2} right) cdot left( frac{pi}{2} - y right) = left( frac{pi}{2} + y right) left( frac{pi}{2} - y right ) = left( frac{pi}{2} right)^2 - y^2So, substituting back into ( x_n ):x_n = frac{4}{pi^2} left( frac{pi^2}{4} - y^2 right ) = frac{4}{pi^2} cdot frac{pi^2}{4} - frac{4}{pi^2} y^2 = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} y^2But ( y = arccos x_{n-1} ), so:x_n = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} left( arccos x_{n-1} right)^2Hmm, that seems a bit simpler. So, the recursion can be rewritten as:x_n = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} left( arccos x_{n-1} right)^2Now, if the sequence converges, let's say it converges to a limit ( L ). Then, taking the limit on both sides, we have:L = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} left( arccos L right)^2So, we need to solve for ( L ) in the equation:L = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} left( arccos L right)^2Let me denote ( theta = arccos L ). Then, ( L = cos theta ), and the equation becomes:cos theta = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} theta^2So, we have:cos theta + frac{4}{pi^2} theta^2 = 1Hmm, okay. So, we need to find ( theta ) such that ( cos theta + frac{4}{pi^2} theta^2 = 1 ). Let me rearrange this:frac{4}{pi^2} theta^2 = 1 - cos thetaI remember that ( 1 - cos theta = 2 sin^2 left( frac{theta}{2} right ) ). Let me use that identity:frac{4}{pi^2} theta^2 = 2 sin^2 left( frac{theta}{2} right )Simplify:frac{2}{pi^2} theta^2 = sin^2 left( frac{theta}{2} right )Taking square roots on both sides (since both sides are non-negative):sqrt{frac{2}{pi^2}} theta = sin left( frac{theta}{2} right )Which simplifies to:frac{sqrt{2}}{pi} theta = sin left( frac{theta}{2} right )Let me denote ( phi = frac{theta}{2} ). Then, ( theta = 2 phi ), and substituting back:frac{sqrt{2}}{pi} cdot 2 phi = sin phifrac{2 sqrt{2}}{pi} phi = sin phiSo, we have:sin phi = frac{2 sqrt{2}}{pi} phiHmm, okay. So, we're looking for a solution ( phi ) to the equation ( sin phi = k phi ), where ( k = frac{2 sqrt{2}}{pi} ).I know that the equation ( sin phi = k phi ) has solutions depending on the value of ( k ). For ( k = 1 ), the only solution is ( phi = 0 ). For smaller ( k ), there might be non-zero solutions as well.Let me compute ( k ):k = frac{2 sqrt{2}}{pi} approx frac{2 times 1.4142}{3.1416} approx frac{2.8284}{3.1416} approx 0.9So, ( k approx 0.9 ). Since ( k < 1 ), there might be non-zero solutions. Let me see.We can consider the function ( f(phi) = sin phi - k phi ). We need to find the roots of ( f(phi) = 0 ).We know that ( f(0) = 0 ). Let's check the behavior near zero. The derivative ( f'(phi) = cos phi - k ). At ( phi = 0 ), ( f'(0) = 1 - k approx 1 - 0.9 = 0.1 > 0 ). So, near zero, the function is increasing.As ( phi ) increases, ( sin phi ) oscillates between -1 and 1, while ( k phi ) is a straight line with slope ( k ). Since ( k approx 0.9 ), the line ( k phi ) will intersect ( sin phi ) somewhere between ( phi = 0 ) and ( phi = pi/2 ), perhaps.Wait, let me compute ( f(pi/2) ):f(pi/2) = sin(pi/2) - k (pi/2) = 1 - k (pi/2) approx 1 - 0.9 times 1.5708 approx 1 - 1.4137 approx -0.4137So, ( f(pi/2) approx -0.4137 ). Since ( f(0) = 0 ) and ( f(pi/2) approx -0.4137 ), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be another root between ( 0 ) and ( pi/2 ). Wait, but at ( phi = 0 ), ( f(phi) = 0 ), and it's increasing near zero, but then starts decreasing. So, maybe only one root at ( phi = 0 ) and another somewhere else?Wait, actually, let's plot the function mentally. At ( phi = 0 ), both ( sin phi ) and ( k phi ) are zero. The derivative of ( sin phi ) is ( cos phi ), which is 1 at ( phi = 0 ), while the derivative of ( k phi ) is ( k approx 0.9 ). So, near zero, ( sin phi ) is growing faster than ( k phi ), so ( f(phi) ) increases from zero. Then, as ( phi ) increases, ( sin phi ) starts to flatten out, while ( k phi ) continues to increase linearly. So, at some point, ( k phi ) will overtake ( sin phi ), causing ( f(phi) ) to become negative. Therefore, there must be another root between ( 0 ) and ( pi/2 ).But wait, actually, since ( f(0) = 0 ), ( f(pi/2) approx -0.4137 ), and the function is continuous, it must cross zero somewhere between ( 0 ) and ( pi/2 ). However, since ( f(0) = 0 ) and ( f(pi/2) < 0 ), and the function is increasing near zero, it must first increase, reach a maximum, then decrease, crossing zero again. So, there are two roots: one at ( phi = 0 ) and another somewhere between ( 0 ) and ( pi/2 ).But in our case, ( phi = frac{theta}{2} ), and ( theta = arccos L ). Since ( arccos L ) is in the range ( [0, pi] ), ( phi ) is in ( [0, pi/2] ). So, we're looking for a solution ( phi ) in ( [0, pi/2] ).So, the solutions are ( phi = 0 ) and another ( phi ) in ( (0, pi/2) ). Let's see if ( phi = 0 ) is a solution.If ( phi = 0 ), then ( theta = 0 ), so ( L = cos 0 = 1 ). Let's check if ( L = 1 ) satisfies the original equation:L = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos 1)^2 = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (0)^2 = 1Yes, that works. So, ( L = 1 ) is a fixed point.But is there another fixed point? Let's see. Suppose ( phi ) is not zero. Then, we have ( sin phi = k phi ), where ( k approx 0.9 ). Let's try to approximate the solution numerically.Let me set up the equation:sin phi = frac{2 sqrt{2}}{pi} phiLet me denote ( k = frac{2 sqrt{2}}{pi} approx 0.9 ). So, we have ( sin phi = 0.9 phi ).Let me try plugging in some values:- At ( phi = 0 ): ( sin 0 = 0 = 0.9 times 0 ). So, 0 is a solution.- At ( phi = pi/4 approx 0.7854 ): ( sin(pi/4) approx 0.7071 ), ( 0.9 times 0.7854 approx 0.7069 ). Wow, that's very close.- So, ( sin(pi/4) approx 0.7071 ) and ( 0.9 times pi/4 approx 0.7069 ). So, they are almost equal.So, ( phi approx pi/4 ) is another solution.Wait, let me compute more accurately.Compute ( sin(pi/4) ):sin(pi/4) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} approx 0.70710678Compute ( k times pi/4 ):k = frac{2 sqrt{2}}{pi} approx 0.9So, ( k times pi/4 = frac{2 sqrt{2}}{pi} times frac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} approx 0.70710678 )Wait, that's exactly equal! So, ( sin(pi/4) = k times pi/4 ). So, ( phi = pi/4 ) is another solution.Therefore, the solutions are ( phi = 0 ) and ( phi = pi/4 ).So, going back, ( phi = pi/4 ) implies ( theta = 2 phi = pi/2 ), so ( L = cos(theta) = cos(pi/2) = 0 ).Wait, that's interesting. So, the fixed points are ( L = 1 ) and ( L = 0 ). Hmm.But wait, let's check ( L = 0 ). If ( L = 0 ), then ( arccos 0 = pi/2 ), so plugging into the equation:L = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} left( frac{pi}{2} right )^2 = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} times frac{pi^2}{4} = 1 - 1 = 0Yes, so ( L = 0 ) is also a fixed point.So, we have two fixed points: ( L = 1 ) and ( L = 0 ). Now, we need to determine which one is the limit of the sequence, depending on the initial value ( a ).But wait, the initial value is given as ( x_0 = a ). So, depending on ( a ), the sequence might converge to 0 or 1.But first, let's check the behavior of the function ( f(x) = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos x)^2 ). Since ( x_n = f(x_{n-1}) ), the behavior of the sequence depends on the function ( f ).Let me analyze the function ( f(x) ). The domain of ( f(x) ) is ( x in [-1, 1] ), since ( arccos x ) is defined for ( x ) in that interval.Let me compute ( f(1) ):f(1) = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos 1)^2 = 1 - 0 = 1So, 1 is a fixed point.Compute ( f(0) ):f(0) = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos 0)^2 = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} left( frac{pi}{2} right )^2 = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} times frac{pi^2}{4} = 1 - 1 = 0So, 0 is also a fixed point.Now, let's see the behavior of ( f(x) ) near these fixed points.First, near ( x = 1 ). Let me compute the derivative ( f'(x) ) at ( x = 1 ).Compute ( f'(x) ):f(x) = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos x)^2So,f'(x) = - frac{4}{pi^2} times 2 arccos x times left( -frac{1}{sqrt{1 - x^2}} right ) = frac{8}{pi^2} arccos x times frac{1}{sqrt{1 - x^2}}At ( x = 1 ):f'(1) = frac{8}{pi^2} times 0 times frac{1}{0} Wait, that's undefined. Let me compute the limit as ( x ) approaches 1 from below.Let ( x to 1^- ). Then, ( arccos x to 0 ), and ( sqrt{1 - x^2} to 0 ). So, we have a 0/0 form. Let me apply L'Hospital's Rule.Let me set ( x = 1 - epsilon ), where ( epsilon to 0^+ ).Then, ( arccos x = arccos(1 - epsilon) approx sqrt{2 epsilon} ) (using the approximation ( arccos(1 - epsilon) approx sqrt{2 epsilon} ) for small ( epsilon )).And ( sqrt{1 - x^2} = sqrt{1 - (1 - epsilon)^2} = sqrt{2 epsilon - epsilon^2} approx sqrt{2 epsilon} ).So, ( f'(x) approx frac{8}{pi^2} times sqrt{2 epsilon} times frac{1}{sqrt{2 epsilon}} = frac{8}{pi^2} ).So, the derivative near ( x = 1 ) is approximately ( frac{8}{pi^2} approx frac{8}{9.8696} approx 0.81 ).Since ( |f'(1)| approx 0.81 < 1 ), the fixed point at ( x = 1 ) is attracting.Now, let's check the derivative at ( x = 0 ).Compute ( f'(0) ):f'(0) = frac{8}{pi^2} arccos 0 times frac{1}{sqrt{1 - 0^2}} = frac{8}{pi^2} times frac{pi}{2} times 1 = frac{8}{pi^2} times frac{pi}{2} = frac{4}{pi} approx 1.273Since ( |f'(0)| approx 1.273 > 1 ), the fixed point at ( x = 0 ) is repelling.Therefore, if the sequence converges, it will converge to ( x = 1 ), because ( x = 1 ) is an attracting fixed point, and ( x = 0 ) is repelling.But wait, we need to make sure that the sequence actually converges. So, let's analyze the behavior of the function ( f(x) ) on the interval ( [-1, 1] ).First, note that ( f(x) ) is defined on ( [-1, 1] ). Let's see where ( f(x) ) maps this interval.Compute ( f(-1) ):f(-1) = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos (-1))^2 = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (pi)^2 = 1 - 4 = -3Wait, that's outside the interval ( [-1, 1] ). Hmm, that's a problem because ( x_n ) is defined using ( arccos x_{n-1} ) and ( arcsin x_{n-1} ), which require ( x_{n-1} ) to be in ( [-1, 1] ). So, if ( x_{n} ) is outside ( [-1, 1] ), the sequence is undefined.But wait, in the problem statement, it's given that ( x_0 = a ). So, perhaps ( a ) is in ( [-1, 1] ). Let me check.The problem says ( x_0 = a ), but it doesn't specify the range of ( a ). However, since ( arccos x ) and ( arcsin x ) are only defined for ( x in [-1, 1] ), it's implied that ( a in [-1, 1] ). Otherwise, the sequence wouldn't be defined.So, assuming ( a in [-1, 1] ), let's see what ( f(x) ) does.Compute ( f(1) = 1 ), as before.Compute ( f(-1) = -3 ), which is outside the interval. So, if ( x_{n-1} = -1 ), then ( x_n = -3 ), which is outside the domain. So, unless ( a in (-1, 1] ), the sequence might go out of bounds.Wait, but ( x_n ) is defined as ( frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos x_{n-1} + pi/2) cdot arcsin x_{n-1} ). Let me compute the range of this function.Note that ( arccos x ) is in ( [0, pi] ), and ( arcsin x ) is in ( [-pi/2, pi/2] ). So, their product is in ( [-pi^2/2, pi^2/2] ). Then, scaling by ( frac{4}{pi^2} ), the range becomes ( [-2, 2] ).But since ( arccos x + pi/2 ) is always positive (since ( arccos x geq 0 )), and ( arcsin x ) can be negative or positive, the product can be negative or positive. However, ( x_n ) is defined as that product, so ( x_n ) can be in ( [-2, 2] ).But wait, ( arccos x ) is in ( [0, pi] ), so ( arccos x + pi/2 ) is in ( [pi/2, 3pi/2] ). And ( arcsin x ) is in ( [-pi/2, pi/2] ). So, their product is in ( [-3pi^2/4, 3pi^2/4] ), approximately ( [-7.4, 7.4] ). Then, scaling by ( frac{4}{pi^2} approx 0.405 ), so the range is roughly ( [-3, 3] ).But wait, that seems conflicting with the earlier computation. Let me compute ( f(x) ) at some points.Compute ( f(1) = 1 ), as before.Compute ( f(0) = 0 ).Compute ( f(-1) = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (pi)^2 = 1 - 4 = -3 ).Compute ( f(1/2) ):f(1/2) = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos (1/2))^2 = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} left( frac{pi}{3} right )^2 = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} times frac{pi^2}{9} = 1 - frac{4}{9} = frac{5}{9} approx 0.5556Compute ( f(-1/2) ):f(-1/2) = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos (-1/2))^2 = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} left( frac{2pi}{3} right )^2 = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} times frac{4pi^2}{9} = 1 - frac{16}{9} = -frac{7}{9} approx -0.7778So, ( f(-1/2) approx -0.7778 ), which is still within ( [-1, 1] ). Wait, but ( f(-1) = -3 ), which is outside.So, if ( x_{n-1} = -1 ), ( x_n = -3 ), which is outside the domain. So, unless ( a in (-1, 1] ), the sequence might go out of bounds on the first step.But the problem statement doesn't specify ( a ), so perhaps we can assume ( a in (-1, 1] ) to keep the sequence defined.Alternatively, maybe the function ( f(x) ) maps ( [-1, 1] ) into ( [-3, 1] ), but since ( x_n ) is defined using ( arccos x_{n-1} ) and ( arcsin x_{n-1} ), which require ( x_{n-1} in [-1, 1] ), the sequence is only defined if all ( x_n in [-1, 1] ).Therefore, to have the sequence defined for all ( n ), ( a ) must be chosen such that ( x_n in [-1, 1] ) for all ( n ). So, perhaps ( a in [c, 1] ), where ( c ) is some lower bound such that ( f(c) geq -1 ).Wait, but ( f(x) ) can go as low as -3 when ( x = -1 ), but if ( x ) is in ( (-1, 1] ), then ( f(x) ) is in ( (-3, 1] ). But to keep ( x_n in [-1, 1] ), we need ( f(x) in [-1, 1] ). So, we need to find the range of ( x ) such that ( f(x) in [-1, 1] ).So, solve ( -1 leq f(x) leq 1 ):-1 leq 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos x)^2 leq 1Subtract 1:-2 leq - frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos x)^2 leq 0Multiply by -1 (reverse inequalities):0 leq frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos x)^2 leq 2Divide by ( frac{4}{pi^2} ):0 leq (arccos x)^2 leq frac{pi^2}{2}Take square roots:0 leq arccos x leq frac{pi}{sqrt{2}} approx 2.2214But ( arccos x ) is in ( [0, pi] approx [0, 3.1416] ). So, the upper bound ( frac{pi}{sqrt{2}} approx 2.2214 ) is less than ( pi ). Therefore, ( arccos x leq frac{pi}{sqrt{2}} ) implies ( x geq cos left( frac{pi}{sqrt{2}} right ) approx cos(2.2214) approx -0.604 ).Therefore, ( x geq cos left( frac{pi}{sqrt{2}} right ) approx -0.604 ) to ensure ( f(x) geq -1 ).So, if ( a geq cos left( frac{pi}{sqrt{2}} right ) approx -0.604 ), then ( x_1 = f(a) geq -1 ). But ( x_1 ) could still be less than ( cos left( frac{pi}{sqrt{2}} right ) ), potentially causing ( x_2 ) to be less than -1, which would be undefined.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe instead of trying to find the exact domain, I can consider that if ( a ) is in ( [-1, 1] ), the sequence is defined, but whether it converges depends on the behavior.But given that ( x = 1 ) is an attracting fixed point, and ( x = 0 ) is repelling, perhaps the sequence converges to 1 for all ( a ) in some interval.Wait, let me test with some specific values.Case 1: ( a = 1 ). Then, ( x_0 = 1 ), ( x_1 = f(1) = 1 ), so the sequence is constant at 1.Case 2: ( a = 0 ). Then, ( x_0 = 0 ), ( x_1 = f(0) = 0 ). So, the sequence is constant at 0.But wait, earlier we saw that ( f'(0) approx 1.273 > 1 ), so 0 is a repelling fixed point. So, if we start exactly at 0, we stay at 0, but if we start near 0, we move away.Case 3: ( a = 1/2 ). Then, ( x_0 = 1/2 ), ( x_1 = f(1/2) approx 0.5556 ), ( x_2 = f(0.5556) ). Let me compute ( f(0.5556) ).First, compute ( arccos(0.5556) ). Let me use a calculator:( arccos(0.5556) approx 0.988 ) radians (since ( cos(1) approx 0.5403 ), so 0.5556 is slightly less than 1 radian, maybe around 0.988).Then, ( f(0.5556) = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (0.988)^2 approx 1 - frac{4}{9.8696} times 0.976 approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.976 approx 1 - 0.379 approx 0.621 ).So, ( x_2 approx 0.621 ). Then, ( x_3 = f(0.621) ).Compute ( arccos(0.621) approx 0.902 ) radians.Then, ( f(0.621) = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (0.902)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.814 approx 1 - 0.316 approx 0.684 ).So, ( x_3 approx 0.684 ). Continuing:( x_4 = f(0.684) ). Compute ( arccos(0.684) approx 0.805 ) radians.( f(0.684) = 1 - 0.389 times (0.805)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.648 approx 1 - 0.252 approx 0.748 ).( x_4 approx 0.748 ).( x_5 = f(0.748) ). ( arccos(0.748) approx 0.705 ) radians.( f(0.748) approx 1 - 0.389 times (0.705)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.497 approx 1 - 0.193 approx 0.807 ).( x_5 approx 0.807 ).( x_6 = f(0.807) ). ( arccos(0.807) approx 0.629 ) radians.( f(0.807) approx 1 - 0.389 times (0.629)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.395 approx 1 - 0.154 approx 0.846 ).( x_6 approx 0.846 ).( x_7 = f(0.846) ). ( arccos(0.846) approx 0.562 ) radians.( f(0.846) approx 1 - 0.389 times (0.562)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.316 approx 1 - 0.123 approx 0.877 ).( x_7 approx 0.877 ).( x_8 = f(0.877) ). ( arccos(0.877) approx 0.500 ) radians.( f(0.877) approx 1 - 0.389 times (0.5)^2 = 1 - 0.389 times 0.25 = 1 - 0.097 approx 0.903 ).( x_8 approx 0.903 ).( x_9 = f(0.903) ). ( arccos(0.903) approx 0.436 ) radians.( f(0.903) approx 1 - 0.389 times (0.436)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.190 approx 1 - 0.074 approx 0.926 ).( x_9 approx 0.926 ).( x_{10} = f(0.926) ). ( arccos(0.926) approx 0.380 ) radians.( f(0.926) approx 1 - 0.389 times (0.380)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.144 approx 1 - 0.056 approx 0.944 ).( x_{10} approx 0.944 ).Continuing this, it seems like the sequence is approaching 1. Each term is getting closer to 1, albeit slowly.Case 4: ( a = -0.5 ). Let's see what happens.( x_0 = -0.5 ).Compute ( x_1 = f(-0.5) approx -0.7778 ).Now, ( x_1 = -0.7778 ).Compute ( x_2 = f(-0.7778) ).First, ( arccos(-0.7778) approx 2.158 ) radians.Then, ( f(-0.7778) = 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (2.158)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 4.657 approx 1 - 1.814 approx -0.814 ).So, ( x_2 approx -0.814 ).Compute ( x_3 = f(-0.814) ).( arccos(-0.814) approx 2.489 ) radians.( f(-0.814) = 1 - 0.389 times (2.489)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 6.195 approx 1 - 2.414 approx -1.414 ).Wait, ( x_3 approx -1.414 ), which is outside the interval ( [-1, 1] ). So, the sequence is undefined beyond this point.Hmm, so starting at ( a = -0.5 ), the sequence goes out of bounds on the third step.Case 5: ( a = 0.5 ). As we saw earlier, the sequence converges to 1.Case 6: ( a = 0.9 ).Compute ( x_1 = f(0.9) approx 1 - 0.389 times (arccos 0.9)^2 ).( arccos(0.9) approx 0.451 ) radians.So, ( f(0.9) approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.203 approx 1 - 0.079 approx 0.921 ).( x_1 approx 0.921 ).( x_2 = f(0.921) approx 1 - 0.389 times (arccos 0.921)^2 ).( arccos(0.921) approx 0.390 ) radians.( f(0.921) approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.152 approx 1 - 0.059 approx 0.941 ).( x_2 approx 0.941 ).( x_3 = f(0.941) approx 1 - 0.389 times (arccos 0.941)^2 ).( arccos(0.941) approx 0.340 ) radians.( f(0.941) approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.1156 approx 1 - 0.045 approx 0.955 ).( x_3 approx 0.955 ).( x_4 = f(0.955) approx 1 - 0.389 times (arccos 0.955)^2 ).( arccos(0.955) approx 0.299 ) radians.( f(0.955) approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.0894 approx 1 - 0.0348 approx 0.965 ).( x_4 approx 0.965 ).Continuing, it's clear that the sequence is approaching 1.Case 7: ( a = 0.99 ).Compute ( x_1 = f(0.99) approx 1 - 0.389 times (arccos 0.99)^2 ).( arccos(0.99) approx 0.1419 ) radians.( f(0.99) approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.0201 approx 1 - 0.0078 approx 0.9922 ).( x_1 approx 0.9922 ).( x_2 = f(0.9922) approx 1 - 0.389 times (arccos 0.9922)^2 ).( arccos(0.9922) approx 0.125 ) radians.( f(0.9922) approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.0156 approx 1 - 0.00606 approx 0.9939 ).( x_2 approx 0.9939 ).( x_3 = f(0.9939) approx 1 - 0.389 times (arccos 0.9939)^2 ).( arccos(0.9939) approx 0.108 ) radians.( f(0.9939) approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.0117 approx 1 - 0.00455 approx 0.9954 ).( x_3 approx 0.9954 ).( x_4 = f(0.9954) approx 1 - 0.389 times (arccos 0.9954)^2 ).( arccos(0.9954) approx 0.090 ) radians.( f(0.9954) approx 1 - 0.389 times 0.0081 approx 1 - 0.00315 approx 0.9968 ).( x_4 approx 0.9968 ).It's clear that the sequence is converging to 1, albeit very slowly as it approaches 1.Case 8: ( a = 0 ). As before, ( x_n = 0 ) for all ( n ). But since 0 is a repelling fixed point, if we start near 0, we move away. However, starting exactly at 0, we stay at 0.Case 9: ( a = -0.6 ). Let's see.( x_0 = -0.6 ).Compute ( x_1 = f(-0.6) approx 1 - frac{4}{pi^2} (arccos(-0.6))^2 ).( arccos(-0.6) approx 2.214 ) radians.So, ( f(-0.6) approx 1 - 0.389 times (2.214)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 4.899 approx 1 - 1.917 approx -0.917 ).( x_1 approx -0.917 ).Compute ( x_2 = f(-0.917) ).( arccos(-0.917) approx 2.705 ) radians.( f(-0.917) approx 1 - 0.389 times (2.705)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 7.317 approx 1 - 2.845 approx -1.845 ).Which is outside the interval ( [-1, 1] ). So, the sequence is undefined beyond this point.So, from these test cases, it seems that if ( a ) is in ( [c, 1] ), where ( c ) is some value greater than -1, the sequence converges to 1. However, if ( a ) is too negative (e.g., ( a = -0.5 ) or ( a = -0.6 )), the sequence can go outside the domain ( [-1, 1] ) and become undefined.But the problem statement doesn't specify the initial value ( a ); it just says ( x_0 = a ). So, perhaps we can assume that ( a ) is chosen such that the sequence remains within ( [-1, 1] ) for all ( n ). Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider the limit assuming convergence, regardless of the initial value.Given that, and considering that ( x = 1 ) is the attracting fixed point, it's reasonable to conclude that the sequence converges to 1 for initial values ( a ) in the basin of attraction of 1, which likely includes all ( a ) in ( (-1, 1] ) except those that lead the sequence to escape the interval.But since the problem just asks to prove that the sequence has a limit as ( n ) approaches infinity and find this limit, without specifying ( a ), perhaps it's safe to assume that ( a ) is such that the sequence remains within ( [-1, 1] ) and converges to 1.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to show that regardless of ( a ), the limit is 1, but from the test cases, that's not true because starting at ( a = -0.5 ) leads to an undefined sequence.Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes ( a ) is in ( [0, 1] ), which would make the sequence stay within ( [0, 1] ) and converge to 1.Wait, let me check ( a = 0.5 ) as before, which worked. What about ( a = 0.1 )?Compute ( x_1 = f(0.1) approx 1 - 0.389 times (arccos 0.1)^2 ).( arccos(0.1) approx 1.4706 ) radians.So, ( f(0.1) approx 1 - 0.389 times (1.4706)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 2.162 approx 1 - 0.843 approx 0.157 ).( x_1 approx 0.157 ).Compute ( x_2 = f(0.157) approx 1 - 0.389 times (arccos 0.157)^2 ).( arccos(0.157) approx 1.407 ) radians.( f(0.157) approx 1 - 0.389 times (1.407)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 1.98 approx 1 - 0.771 approx 0.229 ).( x_2 approx 0.229 ).( x_3 = f(0.229) approx 1 - 0.389 times (arccos 0.229)^2 ).( arccos(0.229) approx 1.335 ) radians.( f(0.229) approx 1 - 0.389 times (1.335)^2 approx 1 - 0.389 times 1.782 approx 1 - 0.693 approx 0.307 ).( x_3 approx 0.307 ).Continuing, it's clear that the sequence is increasing towards 1.So, for ( a = 0.1 ), the sequence is converging to 1.Therefore, it seems that for ( a in [0, 1] ), the sequence converges to 1. For ( a in (-1, 0) ), depending on how negative ( a ) is, the sequence might either converge to 1 or escape the interval ( [-1, 1] ).But since the problem doesn't specify ( a ), perhaps we can conclude that if the sequence remains within ( [-1, 1] ), it converges to 1. Otherwise, it doesn't converge.But the problem says \\"Prove that the sequence ( {x_n} ) has a limit as ( n ) approaches infinity, and find this limit.\\" So, perhaps the problem assumes that the sequence is convergent, and we just need to find the limit, regardless of the initial value.Given that, and knowing that 1 is the attracting fixed point, I think the limit is 1.Therefore, the sequence converges to 1.**Final Answer**The limit of the sequence is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Two sequences  {a_i}  and  {b_i}  are defined as follows:  { a_i } = 0, 3, 8, dots, n^2 - 1, dots  and  { b_i } = 2, 5, 10, dots, n^2 + 1, dots  . If both sequences are defined with  i  ranging across the natural numbers, how many numbers belong to both sequences?*Proposed by Isabella Grabski*","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are two sequences, {a_i} and {b_i}. They're defined as follows: {a_i} starts with 0, 3, 8, and so on, following the formula n² - 1. The other sequence, {b_i}, starts with 2, 5, 10, and so on, following the formula n² + 1. The question is asking how many numbers are common to both sequences when i ranges over all natural numbers.Hmm, so I need to find the intersection of these two sequences. That is, find all numbers that can be expressed both as n² - 1 and m² + 1 for some natural numbers n and m.Let me write down the equations:a_i = n² - 1b_j = m² + 1We need to find numbers that satisfy both equations, so set them equal:n² - 1 = m² + 1Simplify that equation:n² - m² = 2Hmm, this looks like a difference of squares. Remember, n² - m² factors into (n - m)(n + m). So:(n - m)(n + m) = 2Now, since n and m are natural numbers, both (n - m) and (n + m) must be positive integers. Also, (n - m) must be less than or equal to (n + m). So, we can think about the factor pairs of 2.The positive integer factors of 2 are 1 and 2. So, the possible pairs (d, D) where d = n - m and D = n + m, such that d * D = 2, are:1) d = 1, D = 2Because 1 * 2 = 2.Are there any other factor pairs? Well, 2 is a prime number, so the only positive integer pairs are (1, 2). So, that's the only possibility.So, set up the equations:n - m = 1n + m = 2Now, we can solve these two equations for n and m.Adding the two equations:(n - m) + (n + m) = 1 + 22n = 3n = 3/2Wait, n is supposed to be a natural number, right? 3/2 is 1.5, which isn't a natural number. Hmm, that's a problem.So, does that mean there are no solutions? Because n and m have to be natural numbers, and this gives us a fractional value.But let me double-check my steps.We started with n² - 1 = m² + 1, which simplifies to n² - m² = 2. Factored into (n - m)(n + m) = 2.Since n and m are natural numbers, n must be greater than m, because n² is larger than m² (since their difference is positive). So, n > m, meaning n - m is at least 1.The only factor pair is (1, 2). So, solving gives n = 3/2, which is not natural. So, no solution in natural numbers.Therefore, the two sequences don't have any common terms.Wait, but let me test with small numbers to make sure.Looking at the first few terms of {a_i}: 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, 35, 48, 63, 80, 99, 120, etc.And {b_i}: 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, 37, 50, 65, 82, 101, 122, etc.Looking for overlaps. Let's see:0 vs 2, 5, 10, 17,... nope.3 vs 2,5,10,17,... nope.8 vs 2,5,10,17,... nope.15 vs 2,5,10,17,26,... nope.24 vs 2,5,10,17,26,37,... nope.35 vs 2,5,10,17,26,37,50,... 35 vs 37, nope.48 vs 50, nope.63 vs 65, nope.80 vs 82, nope.99 vs 101, nope.120 vs 122, nope.So, up to 120, no overlaps. It seems like they don't intersect.But wait, maybe for larger numbers? Let me think.Suppose n and m are larger. Let's suppose n = m + k, where k is some positive integer.Then, n² - m² = (m + k)² - m² = 2mk + k² = 2.So, 2mk + k² = 2.Since k is a positive integer, let's try k=1:2m(1) + 1² = 2m + 1 = 2 => 2m = 1 => m = 0.5, which is not natural.k=2:2m(2) + 2² = 4m + 4 = 2 => 4m = -2 => m negative, which is invalid.k=3:2m(3) + 9 = 6m + 9 = 2 => 6m = -7 => invalid.So, no solutions for k >=1.Therefore, there are no natural numbers n and m such that n² - m² = 2.Hence, the sequences {a_i} and {b_i} have no common terms.So, the answer is zero.**Final Answer**boxed{0}"},{"question":"Simplify first, then evaluate: 2(x^{2}y-2xy)-3(x^{2}y-3xy)+x^{2}y, where x=-1 and y=frac{1}{5}.","answer":"First, I will simplify the expression by expanding and combining like terms.Starting with the given expression:2(x²y - 2xy) - 3(x²y - 3xy) + x²yI will distribute the coefficients:2x²y - 4xy - 3x²y + 9xy + x²yNext, I will combine the like terms for x²y:(2x²y - 3x²y + x²y) = 0x²yThen, I will combine the like terms for xy:(-4xy + 9xy) = 5xyAfter simplifying, the expression becomes:5xyNow, I will substitute the given values x = -1 and y = 1/5 into the simplified expression:5 * (-1) * (1/5) = -1Therefore, the final value of the expression is -1."},{"question":"Given two points ( P(cos alpha, sin alpha) ) and ( Q(cos beta, sin beta) ), what is the maximum value of ( | PQ | )?A. ( sqrt{2} )B. 2C. 4D. Does not exist","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given two points P and Q on a unit circle, where P is (cos α, sin α) and Q is (cos β, sin β). I need to find the maximum value of the distance between P and Q, which is denoted as |PQ|. The options are A. √2, B. 2, C. 4, D. Does not exist. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the distance between two points in a plane can be found using the distance formula. So, if I have two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the distance between them is √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]. Applying this to points P and Q, their coordinates are given in terms of cosine and sine of angles α and β. So, let me write that down.The coordinates of P are (cos α, sin α), and Q are (cos β, sin β). So, the distance |PQ| would be:|PQ| = √[(cos β - cos α)² + (sin β - sin α)²]Okay, that's the formula. Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression. Since both P and Q lie on the unit circle, their distance apart can vary depending on the angles α and β. I need to figure out when this distance is the largest possible.I recall that on a unit circle, the maximum distance between two points occurs when they are diametrically opposite each other. That is, when the angle between them is 180 degrees or π radians. In that case, the distance between them should be equal to the diameter of the circle. Since it's a unit circle, the radius is 1, so the diameter is 2. Therefore, the maximum distance should be 2. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me verify it using the distance formula.Let me compute |PQ|² to make it simpler, since the square root can complicate things. So, |PQ|² = (cos β - cos α)² + (sin β - sin α)². Let me expand this:= cos²β - 2 cos β cos α + cos²α + sin²β - 2 sin β sin α + sin²αNow, I can group the terms:= (cos²β + sin²β) + (cos²α + sin²α) - 2(cos β cos α + sin β sin α)I remember that cos²θ + sin²θ = 1 for any angle θ. So, substituting that in:= 1 + 1 - 2(cos β cos α + sin β sin α)Simplify:= 2 - 2(cos β cos α + sin β sin α)Hmm, I also remember that cos(β - α) = cos β cos α + sin β sin α. So, substituting that identity in:= 2 - 2 cos(β - α)Therefore, |PQ|² = 2 - 2 cos(β - α). Taking the square root, we get:|PQ| = √[2 - 2 cos(β - α)] = √[2(1 - cos(β - α))]Now, I can use another trigonometric identity here. I remember that 1 - cos θ = 2 sin²(θ/2). Let me apply that:|PQ| = √[2 * 2 sin²((β - α)/2)] = √[4 sin²((β - α)/2)] = 2 |sin((β - α)/2)|Since distance is always non-negative, the absolute value is fine. So, |PQ| = 2 |sin((β - α)/2)|.Now, the sine function has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum of -1. Therefore, |sin((β - α)/2)| can be at most 1. Hence, the maximum value of |PQ| is 2 * 1 = 2.So, the maximum distance between P and Q is 2. That corresponds to option B. Let me just think if there's any case where this might not hold. Since both points are on the unit circle, the maximum distance is indeed the diameter, which is 2. So, I think that's correct.Wait, just to make sure, let me consider specific angles. If α = 0 and β = π, then P is (1, 0) and Q is (-1, 0). The distance between them is √[(-1 - 1)² + (0 - 0)²] = √[(-2)²] = √4 = 2. Yep, that checks out.Alternatively, if α = π/2 and β = 3π/2, then P is (0, 1) and Q is (0, -1). The distance is √[(0 - 0)² + (-1 - 1)²] = √[0 + (-2)²] = √4 = 2. Again, same result.So, regardless of the specific angles, as long as the angle between them is π radians, the distance is 2. That makes sense because they are directly opposite each other on the circle.I think I'm confident now that the maximum value of |PQ| is 2. So, the answer should be B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Color the numbers 2, 3, cdots, 9 with one of three colors - red, green, or blue - such that each number is colored differently from its factors. How many different ways can this coloring be done?(A) 144(B) 216(C) 256(D) 384(E) 432","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to color the numbers from 2 to 9 using three colors: red, green, or blue. The rule is that each number must be colored differently from its factors. I need to figure out how many different ways I can do this coloring. The options are 144, 216, 256, 384, or 432. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me list out the numbers I need to color: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. That's eight numbers in total. Each of these needs to be colored either red, green, or blue. But the catch is that each number must be a different color from its factors. So, for each number, I need to look at its factors and make sure that the color I choose isn't the same as any of its factors.Let me think about the factors of each number:- 2: Prime number, factors are 1 and 2. But since we're starting from 2, the only factor in our range is 2 itself. So, 2 doesn't have any other factors in the list except itself. So, maybe 2 can be colored freely? Or does it have to be different from 1? Wait, 1 isn't in our list, so maybe 2 can be any color.Wait, hold on. The problem says \\"each number is colored differently from its factors.\\" So, for 2, its factors are 1 and 2. Since 1 isn't in our list, does that mean 2 only needs to be different from itself? But that doesn't make sense because a number can't be different from itself. Maybe the rule is that each number must be colored differently from its proper factors, meaning factors other than itself. So, for 2, the only proper factor is 1, which isn't in our list. So, 2 can be colored any of the three colors.Similarly, let's check 3. Its factors are 1 and 3. Again, 1 isn't in our list, so 3 can also be colored any of the three colors.Moving on to 4. The factors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. So, in our list, 2 is a factor of 4. Therefore, 4 must be colored differently from 2.Next, 5. Its factors are 1 and 5. Since 1 isn't in our list, 5 can be any color.6: Factors are 1, 2, 3, 6. So, in our list, 2 and 3 are factors. Therefore, 6 must be colored differently from both 2 and 3.7: Factors are 1 and 7. So, 7 can be any color.8: Factors are 1, 2, 4, 8. So, in our list, 2 and 4 are factors. Therefore, 8 must be colored differently from both 2 and 4.9: Factors are 1, 3, 9. So, in our list, 3 is a factor. Therefore, 9 must be colored differently from 3.Okay, so let me summarize the dependencies:- 2: No restrictions (can be R, G, B)- 3: No restrictions (can be R, G, B)- 4: Must differ from 2- 5: No restrictions- 6: Must differ from 2 and 3- 7: No restrictions- 8: Must differ from 2 and 4- 9: Must differ from 3So, now, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each number is a node, and edges connect numbers that cannot have the same color. Then, the problem reduces to counting the number of valid colorings of this graph with three colors.Let me try to visualize the graph:- 2 is connected to 4, 6, 8- 3 is connected to 6, 9- 4 is connected to 2, 8- 5 is isolated- 6 is connected to 2, 3- 7 is isolated- 8 is connected to 2, 4- 9 is connected to 3So, the graph has two connected components: one involving 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and another with 5 and 7. Since 5 and 7 are isolated, their colorings are independent of the rest.So, maybe I can compute the number of colorings for the main component and then multiply by the colorings for 5 and 7.Let me first handle the main component: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.Let me try to find the number of colorings for these nodes with the given constraints.Let me list the nodes and their dependencies:- 2: connected to 4, 6, 8- 3: connected to 6, 9- 4: connected to 2, 8- 6: connected to 2, 3- 8: connected to 2, 4- 9: connected to 3So, perhaps I can model this as a graph and compute the number of colorings using graph coloring principles.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this step by step, coloring each number one by one, considering the restrictions.Let me try that.First, let's consider the order in which to color the numbers. Maybe starting with the ones that have the most restrictions.Looking at the dependencies, 6 is connected to both 2 and 3, so it depends on both. Similarly, 8 is connected to both 2 and 4, which is connected to 2. So, perhaps 2 is a central node here.Maybe I should start by coloring 2, then 3, then 4, 6, 8, 9.Let me try that.1. Color 2: 3 choices (R, G, B)2. Color 3: 3 choices (R, G, B)3. Color 4: Must be different from 2. So, if 2 is colored, say, R, then 4 can be G or B. So, 2 choices.4. Color 6: Must be different from 2 and 3. So, if 2 and 3 are colored, say, R and G, then 6 can be B. If 2 and 3 are the same color, then 6 has 2 choices. Wait, but 2 and 3 can be same or different?Wait, hold on. 2 and 3 are independent; they don't have any restrictions between themselves. So, 2 and 3 can be the same color or different.Therefore, when coloring 6, which must differ from both 2 and 3, the number of choices depends on whether 2 and 3 are the same color or not.Similarly, when coloring 8, which must differ from 2 and 4. Since 4 is already colored differently from 2, 8 must differ from both 2 and 4, which are different colors. So, 8 has 1 choice if 2 and 4 are different.Wait, let me think again.If 2 is colored R, then 4 is colored G or B. Suppose 4 is colored G. Then, 8 must differ from both 2 (R) and 4 (G), so 8 must be B. So, only 1 choice.Similarly, if 4 is colored B, then 8 must be G. So, 1 choice regardless.So, 8 has 1 choice once 2 and 4 are colored.Similarly, 6 must differ from 2 and 3. So, if 2 and 3 are the same color, then 6 has 2 choices. If 2 and 3 are different colors, then 6 has 1 choice.So, perhaps I need to consider two cases: Case 1 where 2 and 3 are the same color, and Case 2 where they are different.Let me structure this:Case 1: 2 and 3 are the same color.Case 2: 2 and 3 are different colors.Compute the number of colorings for each case and sum them up.Let me start with Case 1: 2 and 3 are the same color.Case 1:1. Color 2: 3 choices.2. Color 3: Must be same as 2, so 1 choice.3. Color 4: Must differ from 2. So, 2 choices.4. Color 6: Must differ from 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are same, 6 has 2 choices.5. Color 8: Must differ from 2 and 4. Since 2 and 4 are different, 8 has 1 choice.6. Color 9: Must differ from 3. Since 3 is same as 2, 9 has 2 choices.So, the number of colorings in Case 1 is:3 (for 2) * 1 (for 3) * 2 (for 4) * 2 (for 6) * 1 (for 8) * 2 (for 9) = 3 * 1 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 2 = 24.Case 2: 2 and 3 are different colors.1. Color 2: 3 choices.2. Color 3: Must be different from 2. So, 2 choices.3. Color 4: Must differ from 2. So, 2 choices.4. Color 6: Must differ from both 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are different, 6 has 1 choice.5. Color 8: Must differ from 2 and 4. Since 2 and 4 are different, 8 has 1 choice.6. Color 9: Must differ from 3. So, 2 choices.So, the number of colorings in Case 2 is:3 (for 2) * 2 (for 3) * 2 (for 4) * 1 (for 6) * 1 (for 8) * 2 (for 9) = 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 * 2 = 24.Wait, that can't be right. Both cases give 24? That would mean total colorings for the main component are 24 + 24 = 48.But let me verify.Wait, in Case 1, 2 and 3 are same color. So, 3 choices for 2, 1 for 3, 2 for 4, 2 for 6, 1 for 8, 2 for 9: 3*1*2*2*1*2=24.In Case 2, 2 and 3 are different. So, 3*2*2*1*1*2=24.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the main component (2,3,4,6,8,9) has 48 colorings.Now, the other numbers: 5 and 7. They are isolated, so each can be colored in 3 ways independently.Therefore, the total number of colorings is 48 * 3 (for 5) * 3 (for 7) = 48 * 9 = 432.Wait, but hold on. The answer choices are 144, 216, 256, 384, 432. So, 432 is an option, choice (E). But let me think again because sometimes in counting problems, especially with graph colorings, it's easy to overcount or undercount.Wait, let me make sure that in both cases, I considered all possibilities correctly.In Case 1: 2 and 3 same color.- 2: 3 choices- 3: same as 2, so 1- 4: different from 2, 2 choices- 6: different from 2 and 3 (which are same), so 2 choices- 8: different from 2 and 4 (which are different), so 1 choice- 9: different from 3, which is same as 2, so 2 choicesYes, that seems correct.Case 2: 2 and 3 different.- 2: 3- 3: different from 2, so 2- 4: different from 2, 2- 6: different from both 2 and 3, which are different, so 1- 8: different from 2 and 4, which are different, so 1- 9: different from 3, which is different from 2, so 2Yes, that also seems correct.So, 24 + 24 = 48 for the main component.Then, 5 and 7 each have 3 choices, so 3 * 3 = 9.48 * 9 = 432.Hmm, that seems correct. But let me cross-verify.Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a tree or use multiplication principle step by step.Alternatively, perhaps using permutations.Wait, another way: Let's think of the numbers as nodes with dependencies.We can model this as a graph and compute the number of colorings.But since it's a bit involved, perhaps the way I did it is correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think of the main component as a graph with 6 nodes and compute its chromatic polynomial, but that might be more complicated.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the main component as a combination of smaller components.Wait, actually, the main component is connected, right? Let me see.Looking back, 2 is connected to 4, 6, 8.4 is connected to 2 and 8.6 is connected to 2 and 3.3 is connected to 6 and 9.8 is connected to 2 and 4.9 is connected to 3.So, starting from 2, we can reach 4, 6, 8, 3, 9. So, yes, it's a connected graph.So, the main component is a connected graph with 6 nodes.So, perhaps my initial approach is correct.Alternatively, maybe I can model the dependencies step by step.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the numbers in the order 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.But since 5 and 7 are independent, I can handle them separately.So, let's see:Color 2: 3 choices.Color 3: 3 choices.Color 4: must differ from 2: 2 choices.Color 5: 3 choices.Color 6: must differ from 2 and 3.If 2 and 3 are same: 2 choices.If 2 and 3 are different: 1 choice.Color 7: 3 choices.Color 8: must differ from 2 and 4.Since 2 and 4 are different, 1 choice.Color 9: must differ from 3: 2 choices.But this seems similar to my initial approach.So, in this case, the number of colorings would be:Case 1: 2 and 3 same.3 (for 2) * 1 (for 3) * 2 (for 4) * 3 (for 5) * 2 (for 6) * 3 (for 7) * 1 (for 8) * 2 (for 9) = 3*1*2*3*2*3*1*2 = 3*2*3*2*3*2 = 3^3 * 2^3 = 27 * 8 = 216.Wait, that's different from before. Wait, why?Wait, no, hold on. If I structure it this way, I might be overcounting because I'm interleaving the independent choices.Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.Wait, no, actually, in this approach, I'm considering 5 and 7 as independent, so their colorings can be done at any point, but in reality, their colorings don't interfere with the rest.So, perhaps the total number of colorings is:Number of colorings for the main component (2,3,4,6,8,9) multiplied by colorings for 5 and 7.Which is 48 * 3 * 3 = 432.But in the previous way, when I considered 2 and 3 same or different, I got 48 for the main component, which when multiplied by 9 gives 432.But when I tried to interleave 5 and 7, I got 216, which is different.Wait, that suggests that my initial approach was wrong.Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think.Wait, in the first approach, I separated the main component and the independent nodes, which is correct because the independent nodes don't affect the main component.So, the total colorings should be colorings of main component multiplied by colorings of 5 and 7.So, 48 * 3 * 3 = 432.But when I tried to interleave, I considered 5 and 7 as being colored in the middle, but that might not affect the count because their colorings are independent.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach.Wait, in the second approach, I considered:Color 2: 3Color 3: 3Color 4: 2Color 5: 3Color 6: depends on 2 and 3Color 7: 3Color 8: 1Color 9: 2But in reality, the dependencies are such that 6 depends on 2 and 3, and 8 depends on 2 and 4, and 9 depends on 3.So, perhaps the correct way is:1. Color 2: 32. Color 3: 33. Color 4: 2 (different from 2)4. Color 5: 35. Color 6: depends on 2 and 3. If 2 and 3 are same, 2 choices; else, 1.6. Color 7: 37. Color 8: depends on 2 and 4. Since 2 and 4 are different, 1 choice.8. Color 9: depends on 3. 2 choices.So, if I structure it this way, the total is:3 (2) * 3 (3) * 2 (4) * 3 (5) * [if 2=3: 2 else 1] (6) * 3 (7) * 1 (8) * 2 (9)But this is a bit more involved because it's conditional on whether 2 and 3 are same or different.So, perhaps I need to split into two cases again.Case 1: 2 and 3 same.Number of colorings:3 (2) * 1 (3) * 2 (4) * 3 (5) * 2 (6) * 3 (7) * 1 (8) * 2 (9) = 3*1*2*3*2*3*1*2 = 3*2*3*2*3*2 = 3^3 * 2^3 = 27 * 8 = 216.Case 2: 2 and 3 different.Number of colorings:3 (2) * 2 (3) * 2 (4) * 3 (5) * 1 (6) * 3 (7) * 1 (8) * 2 (9) = 3*2*2*3*1*3*1*2 = 3*2*2*3*3*2 = 3^3 * 2^3 = 27 * 8 = 216.Wait, so total colorings would be 216 + 216 = 432.Ah, okay, so that's consistent with my initial approach. So, the total number is 432.Therefore, the answer should be (E) 432.But let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Wait, in the first approach, I considered the main component as 2,3,4,6,8,9 and found 48 colorings, then multiplied by 3*3=9 for 5 and 7, getting 432.In the second approach, I interleaved 5 and 7 into the coloring process, but still ended up with 432.So, both approaches give the same result, so I think 432 is correct.Therefore, the answer is E) 432.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"If three, standard, 6-faced dice are rolled, what is the probability that the sum of the face up integers is 16?","answer":"To determine the probability that the sum of three standard 6-faced dice is 16, I need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.First, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice is 6 multiplied by itself three times, which is 6 × 6 × 6 = 216.Next, I'll find the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the three dice equals 16.

If each floor has 10 apartments and each apartment has four people, how many people are in the building?","answer":"First, I need to determine how many floors are fully occupied and how many are at half capacity. The building has 12 floors, and half of them are full. So, 12 divided by 2 equals 6 floors that are full.The remaining 6 floors are at half capacity. Each floor has 10 apartments, and each apartment houses 4 people. For the fully occupied floors, each floor has 10 apartments multiplied by 4 people, which equals 40 people per floor. With 6 full floors, that's 6 multiplied by 40, totaling 240 people.For the half-capacity floors, each floor has 10 apartments, but only half are occupied. So, 10 divided by 2 equals 5 apartments occupied per floor. Each occupied apartment has 4 people, so 5 multiplied by 4 equals 20 people per half-capacity floor. With 6 such floors, that's 6 multiplied by 20, totaling 120 people.Finally, adding the people from the fully occupied floors and the half-capacity floors gives 240 plus 120, which equals 360 people in the building."},{"question":"A sports team consists of two boys and two girls.

They satisfy the equation:[frac{sin^{4} alpha}{cos^{2} beta} + frac{cos^{4} alpha}{sin^{2} beta} = 1]And I need to figure out which conclusion is correct among the options A to D. The options are about whether α + β is greater than, less than, not equal to, or equal to π/2. First, since α and β are acute angles, that means both α and β are between 0 and π/2 radians. So, their sum α + β is between 0 and π. But the options are specifically about whether it's greater than, less than, or equal to π/2, so I need to see if there's a relationship between α and β that can be deduced from the given equation.Let me write down the given equation again:[frac{sin^{4} alpha}{cos^{2} beta} + frac{cos^{4} alpha}{sin^{2} beta} = 1]Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify it or find a substitution that can make it easier. Let me think about possible substitutions or trigonometric identities that could help.I know that for acute angles, sin and cos are positive, so I don't have to worry about negative values here. Maybe I can let x = sin α and y = cos α. But wait, since α is an acute angle, sin α and cos α are related by x² + y² = 1. Maybe that can help.Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of tan α or something like that. Let me see.Wait, another thought: perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequality to relate these terms. Because the equation is equal to 1, which is a specific value, maybe the equality condition in an inequality could help.Let me recall the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. It states that for any real numbers a, b, c, d, we have:[(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) geq (ac + bd)^2]Equality holds when a/c = b/d. Maybe I can apply this here.Looking at the given equation:[frac{sin^{4} alpha}{cos^{2} beta} + frac{cos^{4} alpha}{sin^{2} beta} = 1]Let me consider the terms as (sin² α / cos β)² and (cos² α / sin β)². So, if I set a = sin² α / cos β, b = cos² α / sin β, then the equation is a² + b² = 1.But I don't see immediately how to apply Cauchy-Schwarz here. Maybe I need to consider another approach.Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution. Let me let t = α + β. Then, since α and β are acute, t is between 0 and π. But I don't know if that substitution helps directly.Wait, another idea: Maybe I can express cos β and sin β in terms of α. If I can find a relationship between α and β, perhaps I can find that α + β is equal to π/2.Let me suppose that α + β = π/2. Then, β = π/2 - α. Let's substitute this into the equation and see if it holds.So, if β = π/2 - α, then cos β = cos(π/2 - α) = sin α, and sin β = sin(π/2 - α) = cos α.Substituting into the equation:[frac{sin^{4} alpha}{cos^{2} beta} + frac{cos^{4} alpha}{sin^{2} beta} = frac{sin^{4} alpha}{sin^{2} alpha} + frac{cos^{4} alpha}{cos^{2} alpha} = sin^{2} alpha + cos^{2} alpha = 1]Oh! So, if α + β = π/2, then the equation holds true. That means that when α + β = π/2, the given condition is satisfied. But does this mean that α + β must be equal to π/2? Or could there be other possibilities where α + β is not equal to π/2, but the equation still holds?I need to check if the equation can hold when α + β ≠ π/2. Let me try some specific values.Suppose α = β = π/4. Then, α + β = π/2. Let's plug into the equation:sin(π/4) = √2/2, cos(π/4) = √2/2.So,[frac{(sqrt{2}/2)^4}{(sqrt{2}/2)^2} + frac{(sqrt{2}/2)^4}{(sqrt{2}/2)^2} = frac{(4/16)}{(2/4)} + frac{(4/16)}{(2/4)} = frac{(1/4)}{(1/2)} + frac{(1/4)}{(1/2)} = (1/4)*(2) + (1/4)*(2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1]So, that works. Now, let's try another case where α + β ≠ π/2.Let me choose α = π/6 and β = π/3. Then, α + β = π/2, which is the same as before. Wait, that's still π/2. Maybe I need to choose angles where α + β is not π/2.Let me pick α = π/6 and β = π/4. Then, α + β = 5π/12, which is approximately 75 degrees, which is greater than π/2 (which is 90 degrees). Wait, no, 5π/12 is about 75 degrees, which is less than π/2 (90 degrees). Wait, no, π/2 is 90 degrees, so 5π/12 is 75 degrees, which is less than π/2. Hmm, so maybe I should pick α = π/3 and β = π/3. Then, α + β = 2π/3, which is greater than π/2.Let me compute the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation:sin(π/3) = √3/2, cos(π/3) = 1/2.So,[frac{(sqrt{3}/2)^4}{(1/2)^2} + frac{(1/2)^4}{(sqrt{3}/2)^2} = frac{(9/16)}{(1/4)} + frac{(1/16)}{(3/4)} = (9/16)*(4/1) + (1/16)*(4/3) = 9/4 + 1/12 = 27/12 + 1/12 = 28/12 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333...]Which is greater than 1. So, in this case, the equation doesn't hold. So, when α + β > π/2, the LHS is greater than 1.Wait, but in the first case, when α + β = π/2, it's equal to 1. So, maybe when α + β is less than π/2, let's see.Let me pick α = π/6 and β = π/6. Then, α + β = π/3, which is less than π/2.Compute LHS:sin(π/6) = 1/2, cos(π/6) = √3/2.So,[frac{(1/2)^4}{(sqrt{3}/2)^2} + frac{(sqrt{3}/2)^4}{(1/2)^2} = frac{(1/16)}{(3/4)} + frac{(9/16)}{(1/4)} = (1/16)*(4/3) + (9/16)*(4/1) = (1/12) + (9/4) = (1/12) + (27/12) = 28/12 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333...]Again, greater than 1. Hmm, so both when α + β is greater than π/2 and less than π/2, the LHS is greater than 1. Only when α + β = π/2, the LHS is equal to 1. So, that suggests that the only way the equation holds is when α + β = π/2. Therefore, the correct conclusion is D: α + β = π/2.Wait, but let me test another case where α + β is not π/2 but maybe the LHS is still 1. Maybe if α and β are different.Let me try α = π/6 and β = π/3. Then, α + β = π/2, which is the case we already know works. So, let me try α = π/6 and β = π/4. Then, α + β = 5π/12, which is less than π/2.Compute LHS:sin(π/6) = 1/2, cos(π/6) = √3/2.sin(π/4) = √2/2, cos(π/4) = √2/2.So,First term: (sin^4 α)/(cos^2 β) = (1/2)^4 / (√2/2)^2 = (1/16) / (2/4) = (1/16) / (1/2) = (1/16)*(2/1) = 1/8.Second term: (cos^4 α)/(sin^2 β) = (√3/2)^4 / (√2/2)^2 = (9/16) / (2/4) = (9/16) / (1/2) = (9/16)*(2/1) = 9/8.So, total LHS = 1/8 + 9/8 = 10/8 = 5/4 = 1.25, which is greater than 1.Hmm, so again, it's greater than 1. So, seems like only when α + β = π/2, the equation holds. Wait, let me try another case where α + β is not π/2 but maybe the equation still holds. Maybe if I take α = 0, but α is acute, so α can't be 0. Similarly, β can't be 0. So, maybe if I take α approaching 0, then β must approach π/2 to satisfy the equation.Wait, let's see. Suppose α approaches 0, then sin α approaches 0, so the first term becomes 0. Then, the second term is cos^4 α / sin^2 β. Since α approaches 0, cos α approaches 1, so the second term becomes 1 / sin^2 β. For the equation to hold, 1 / sin^2 β must approach 1, so sin β must approach 1, meaning β approaches π/2.Similarly, if β approaches 0, then sin β approaches 0, so the second term becomes cos^4 α / 0, which is undefined or approaches infinity, which can't be 1. So, that's not possible.So, if α approaches 0, β must approach π/2, so α + β approaches π/2. Similarly, if β approaches 0, α must approach π/2, so α + β approaches π/2 as well.So, in all cases, it seems that α + β must equal π/2 for the equation to hold. Therefore, the correct conclusion is D: α + β = π/2.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a case where α + β ≠ π/2 but the equation still holds? Maybe if α and β are such that the terms balance out.Wait, let's suppose that α + β = π/2 + k, where k is some small angle. Maybe the equation can still hold? Let me try with α = π/3 and β = π/4, so α + β = 7π/12, which is greater than π/2.Compute LHS:sin(π/3) = √3/2, cos(π/3) = 1/2.sin(π/4) = √2/2, cos(π/4) = √2/2.First term: (sin^4 α)/(cos^2 β) = ( (√3/2)^4 ) / ( (√2/2)^2 ) = (9/16) / (2/4) = (9/16) / (1/2) = 9/8.Second term: (cos^4 α)/(sin^2 β) = ( (1/2)^4 ) / ( (√2/2)^2 ) = (1/16) / (2/4) = (1/16) / (1/2) = 1/8.So, total LHS = 9/8 + 1/8 = 10/8 = 5/4 = 1.25, which is greater than 1.Hmm, same as before. So, it's still greater than 1. So, seems like only when α + β = π/2, the equation holds.Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution to express β in terms of α, or vice versa, and then see if the equation can only hold when α + β = π/2.Let me try that. Let me let β = π/2 - α + θ, where θ is some angle. Then, I can express cos β and sin β in terms of α and θ.But this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or some optimization technique, but that might be overkill.Wait, another approach: Let me denote t = tan α and s = tan β. Since α and β are acute, t and s are positive real numbers.Express sin α = t / sqrt(1 + t²), cos α = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²).Similarly, sin β = s / sqrt(1 + s²), cos β = 1 / sqrt(1 + s²).Substitute these into the equation:First term: sin^4 α / cos^2 β = (t^4 / (1 + t²)^2) / (1 / (1 + s²)) = t^4 (1 + s²) / (1 + t²)^2.Second term: cos^4 α / sin^2 β = (1 / (1 + t²)^2) / (s² / (1 + s²)) = (1 + s²) / (s² (1 + t²)^2).So, the equation becomes:t^4 (1 + s²) / (1 + t²)^2 + (1 + s²) / (s² (1 + t²)^2) = 1.Factor out (1 + s²) / (1 + t²)^2:(1 + s²) / (1 + t²)^2 [ t^4 + 1 / s² ] = 1.Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can set t = s, but that might not necessarily hold.Alternatively, suppose that t = 1/s, which would imply that α + β = π/2, since tan α = 1/tan β, so β = π/2 - α.Let me test that. If t = 1/s, then s = 1/t.Substitute into the equation:(1 + (1/t²)) / (1 + t²)^2 [ t^4 + t² ] = ?Compute numerator:1 + 1/t² = (t² + 1)/t².Denominator: (1 + t²)^2.Inside the brackets: t^4 + t² = t²(t² + 1).So, putting it all together:[(t² + 1)/t²] / (1 + t²)^2 * t²(t² + 1) = [ (t² + 1)/t² ] * [ t²(t² + 1) ] / (1 + t²)^2.Simplify:(t² + 1)/t² * t²(t² + 1) / (1 + t²)^2 = (t² + 1) * (t² + 1) / (1 + t²)^2 = (t² + 1)^2 / (1 + t²)^2 = 1.So, indeed, when t = 1/s, the equation holds. Therefore, when tan α = 1/tan β, which implies α + β = π/2, the equation holds.But does this mean that the equation can only hold when α + β = π/2? Or are there other possibilities?Earlier, when I tried specific angles where α + β ≠ π/2, the LHS was greater than 1. So, perhaps the equation only holds when α + β = π/2.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the function f(α, β) = sin^4 α / cos^2 β + cos^4 α / sin^2 β and analyze its behavior.But that might be too involved. Alternatively, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality.Wait, let's consider the two terms:A = sin^4 α / cos^2 βB = cos^4 α / sin^2 βWe have A + B = 1.By AM-GM inequality, we have:(A + B)/2 ≥ sqrt(AB)So, 1/2 ≥ sqrt(AB)Which implies AB ≤ 1/4.Compute AB:AB = (sin^4 α / cos^2 β)(cos^4 α / sin^2 β) = sin^4 α cos^4 α / (cos^2 β sin^2 β) = (sin^2 α cos^2 α)^2 / (sin^2 β cos^2 β)Let me denote x = sin^2 α cos^2 α and y = sin^2 β cos^2 β.So, AB = x² / y.But from the given equation, A + B = 1, and we have AB ≤ 1/4.So, x² / y ≤ 1/4.But I don't know if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can express y in terms of x.Wait, but I don't see a direct relationship. Maybe another approach.Wait, let me consider substituting β = π/2 - α. Then, as before, cos β = sin α and sin β = cos α. Then, the equation becomes:sin^4 α / sin^2 α + cos^4 α / cos^2 α = sin^2 α + cos^2 α = 1.So, equality holds. Now, suppose that β ≠ π/2 - α. Let me see if the equation can still hold.Suppose that β = π/2 - α + θ, where θ ≠ 0. Then, cos β = cos(π/2 - α + θ) = sin(α - θ), and sin β = sin(π/2 - α + θ) = cos(α - θ).So, substituting into the equation:sin^4 α / sin^2(α - θ) + cos^4 α / cos^2(α - θ) = 1.Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps for small θ, we can approximate.But maybe instead of that, I can consider the function f(θ) = sin^4 α / sin^2(α - θ) + cos^4 α / cos^2(α - θ) and see if it's minimized when θ = 0.Alternatively, maybe I can take derivatives, but that might be too involved.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when θ ≠ 0, the denominators sin^2(α - θ) and cos^2(α - θ) are different from sin^2 α and cos^2 α, so the terms would change.But without more specific information, it's hard to tell.Wait, but from the earlier examples, when θ ≠ 0, the LHS was greater than 1. So, perhaps the minimum value of the LHS is 1, achieved when θ = 0, i.e., when β = π/2 - α.Therefore, the equation holds only when α + β = π/2.Hence, the correct conclusion is D: α + β = π/2.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"If real numbers a and b satisfy 3^{a}=5^{b}=45, then frac{2}{a}+frac{1}{b}=______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: real numbers ( a ) and ( b ) satisfy ( 3^{a} = 5^{b} = 45 ). I need to find ( frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{b} ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that if ( 3^{a} = 45 ) and ( 5^{b} = 45 ), then both ( a ) and ( b ) are exponents that turn 3 and 5 into 45, respectively. So, maybe I can express ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of logarithms.Let me recall that if ( x^{y} = z ), then ( y = log_{x} z ). So, applying that here, ( a = log_{3} 45 ) and ( b = log_{5} 45 ). That makes sense.Now, I need to compute ( frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{b} ). Substituting the expressions for ( a ) and ( b ), this becomes ( frac{2}{log_{3} 45} + frac{1}{log_{5} 45} ). Hmm, okay.I remember there's a change of base formula for logarithms, which is ( log_{c} d = frac{ln d}{ln c} ). So, maybe I can rewrite these terms using natural logarithms or common logarithms. Let me try that.Using the change of base formula, ( log_{3} 45 = frac{ln 45}{ln 3} ) and ( log_{5} 45 = frac{ln 45}{ln 5} ). So, substituting back into the expression:( frac{2}{log_{3} 45} = frac{2 ln 3}{ln 45} ) and ( frac{1}{log_{5} 45} = frac{ln 5}{ln 45} ).So, adding them together: ( frac{2 ln 3}{ln 45} + frac{ln 5}{ln 45} = frac{2 ln 3 + ln 5}{ln 45} ).Hmm, that simplifies to ( frac{ln (3^2 times 5)}{ln 45} ) because ( 2 ln 3 = ln 3^2 ) and ( ln 5 ) is just ( ln 5 ), so when you add them, it's the logarithm of the product. So, ( 3^2 times 5 = 9 times 5 = 45 ). Therefore, the numerator becomes ( ln 45 ).So, the expression simplifies to ( frac{ln 45}{ln 45} = 1 ). Wait, so is the answer 1? That seems too straightforward, but let me double-check my steps.Starting again, ( 3^{a} = 45 ) implies ( a = log_{3} 45 ). Similarly, ( b = log_{5} 45 ). Then, ( frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{2}{log_{3} 45} + frac{1}{log_{5} 45} ).Using change of base, this is ( 2 times frac{ln 3}{ln 45} + frac{ln 5}{ln 45} ). Combining the terms: ( frac{2 ln 3 + ln 5}{ln 45} ).Factor out the logarithm: ( frac{ln (3^2 times 5)}{ln 45} ). Since ( 3^2 times 5 = 9 times 5 = 45 ), this becomes ( frac{ln 45}{ln 45} = 1 ).Okay, so it seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about expressing 45 in terms of 3 and 5. Since 45 is 9 times 5, which is ( 3^2 times 5 ). So, maybe there's another way to approach this without logarithms.Let me try expressing ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of exponents. Since ( 3^{a} = 45 ), and 45 is ( 3^2 times 5 ), so ( 3^{a} = 3^2 times 5 ). Similarly, ( 5^{b} = 45 = 3^2 times 5 ).So, ( 3^{a} = 3^2 times 5 ). If I take the logarithm base 3 of both sides, I get ( a = log_{3} (3^2 times 5) = log_{3} 3^2 + log_{3} 5 = 2 + log_{3} 5 ). Similarly, for ( b ), taking logarithm base 5: ( b = log_{5} (3^2 times 5) = log_{5} 3^2 + log_{5} 5 = 2 log_{5} 3 + 1 ).So, ( a = 2 + log_{3} 5 ) and ( b = 2 log_{5} 3 + 1 ). Hmm, now I need to compute ( frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{b} ).Let me write ( a ) and ( b ) as:( a = 2 + log_{3} 5 )( b = 2 log_{5} 3 + 1 )So, ( frac{2}{a} = frac{2}{2 + log_{3} 5} ) and ( frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{2 log_{5} 3 + 1} ).Hmm, this seems a bit more complicated, but maybe I can manipulate these expressions.I know that ( log_{3} 5 ) and ( log_{5} 3 ) are reciprocals. Because ( log_{c} d = frac{1}{log_{d} c} ). So, ( log_{3} 5 = frac{1}{log_{5} 3} ). Let me denote ( x = log_{5} 3 ). Then, ( log_{3} 5 = frac{1}{x} ).So, substituting back, ( a = 2 + frac{1}{x} ) and ( b = 2x + 1 ).Therefore, ( frac{2}{a} = frac{2}{2 + frac{1}{x}} ) and ( frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{2x + 1} ).Let me compute ( frac{2}{2 + frac{1}{x}} ). To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by x:( frac{2x}{2x + 1} ).So, ( frac{2}{a} = frac{2x}{2x + 1} ) and ( frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{2x + 1} ).Adding them together: ( frac{2x}{2x + 1} + frac{1}{2x + 1} = frac{2x + 1}{2x + 1} = 1 ).So, again, the result is 1. That seems consistent with my previous method. So, whether I use logarithms directly or substitute variables, I end up with the same answer.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of exponents. Let me see.Since ( 3^{a} = 45 ) and ( 5^{b} = 45 ), I can write ( 3^{a} = 5^{b} ). Taking the logarithm of both sides, perhaps base 3 or base 5.If I take logarithm base 3: ( a = log_{3} 45 = log_{3} (3^2 times 5) = 2 + log_{3} 5 ). Similarly, taking logarithm base 5: ( b = log_{5} 45 = log_{5} (3^2 times 5) = 2 log_{5} 3 + 1 ).So, same as before. Then, the same substitution applies.Alternatively, maybe I can express ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of each other.Since ( 3^{a} = 5^{b} ), taking natural logs: ( a ln 3 = b ln 5 ). So, ( a = frac{b ln 5}{ln 3} ).So, substituting back into ( frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{b} ):( frac{2}{frac{b ln 5}{ln 3}} + frac{1}{b} = frac{2 ln 3}{b ln 5} + frac{1}{b} = frac{2 ln 3 + ln 5}{b ln 5} ).But from earlier, ( b = log_{5} 45 = frac{ln 45}{ln 5} ). So, substituting ( b ):( frac{2 ln 3 + ln 5}{frac{ln 45}{ln 5} times ln 5} = frac{2 ln 3 + ln 5}{ln 45} ).Which is the same as before, leading to 1.So, regardless of the approach, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 1.Another way to think about it is to recognize that ( frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{b} ) can be rewritten in terms of logarithms with the same base, and through manipulation, it simplifies to 1.Alternatively, maybe using the properties of exponents and logarithms more cleverly. Let me see.Given ( 3^{a} = 45 ) and ( 5^{b} = 45 ), so both equal 45. So, ( 3^{a} = 5^{b} ). Taking logarithms, as before, gives ( a ln 3 = b ln 5 ), so ( frac{a}{b} = frac{ln 5}{ln 3} ). So, ( a = b times frac{ln 5}{ln 3} ).But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can express ( frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{b} ) in terms of ( b ):( frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{2}{b times frac{ln 5}{ln 3}} + frac{1}{b} = frac{2 ln 3}{b ln 5} + frac{1}{b} ). Which is the same as before.So, again, same result.Alternatively, maybe I can express ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of each other and substitute.Wait, another thought: since ( 3^{a} = 45 ) and ( 5^{b} = 45 ), maybe I can write ( 3^{a} times 5^{b} = 45 times 45 = 2025 ). But that might complicate things.Alternatively, since both ( 3^{a} ) and ( 5^{b} ) equal 45, maybe I can write ( (3^{a})(5^{b}) = 45 times 45 = 2025 ), but I don't know if that helps.Wait, 45 is 9 times 5, so 45 is ( 3^2 times 5 ). So, ( 3^{a} = 3^2 times 5 ) implies ( 3^{a - 2} = 5 ). Similarly, ( 5^{b} = 3^2 times 5 ) implies ( 5^{b - 1} = 3^2 ).So, ( 3^{a - 2} = 5 ) and ( 5^{b - 1} = 9 ). Taking logarithms:From ( 3^{a - 2} = 5 ), taking log base 3: ( a - 2 = log_{3} 5 ), so ( a = 2 + log_{3} 5 ).From ( 5^{b - 1} = 9 ), taking log base 5: ( b - 1 = log_{5} 9 ), so ( b = 1 + log_{5} 9 ).But ( log_{5} 9 = log_{5} 3^2 = 2 log_{5} 3 ). So, ( b = 1 + 2 log_{5} 3 ).So, again, same expressions as before.Therefore, ( frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{2}{2 + log_{3} 5} + frac{1}{1 + 2 log_{5} 3} ).Let me denote ( x = log_{5} 3 ), so ( log_{3} 5 = frac{1}{x} ).Then, ( a = 2 + frac{1}{x} ) and ( b = 1 + 2x ).So, ( frac{2}{a} = frac{2}{2 + frac{1}{x}} = frac{2x}{2x + 1} ) (by multiplying numerator and denominator by x).And ( frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{1 + 2x} ).Adding them together: ( frac{2x}{2x + 1} + frac{1}{2x + 1} = frac{2x + 1}{2x + 1} = 1 ).So, again, the result is 1.I think I've approached this problem from multiple angles: using logarithms, substitution, properties of exponents, and each time I end up with the same conclusion that ( frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1 ).Therefore, I feel confident that the answer is indeed 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"Calculate: 0-left(-3right)=0+______.","answer":"To solve the equation (0 - (-3) = 0 + ______), I start by simplifying the left side of the equation.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, I remember that for a hyperbola of the form x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, the foci are located at (±c, 0), where c² = a² + b². In this case, the hyperbola is x² - y² = 1, so comparing it to the standard form, a² = 1 and b² = 1. Therefore, a = 1 and b = 1.Now, let's calculate c. Since c² = a² + b², that would be c² = 1 + 1 = 2. So c = √2. Therefore, the foci are at (√2, 0) and (-√2, 0).The problem says the straight line is perpendicular to the x-axis and passes through one of the foci. A line perpendicular to the x-axis is a vertical line, which has the equation x = constant. Since it passes through one of the foci, the constant will be the x-coordinate of the focus. So, the equation of the line is either x = √2 or x = -√2.I think it doesn't matter which focus we choose because of the symmetry of the hyperbola. Whether we take x = √2 or x = -√2, the length of AB should be the same. So, let's pick x = √2 for simplicity.Now, we need to find the points of intersection between the hyperbola x² - y² = 1 and the line x = √2. To do that, substitute x = √2 into the hyperbola equation:(√2)² - y² = 1Calculating (√2)², that's 2. So, 2 - y² = 1.Subtracting 2 from both sides gives -y² = -1, which simplifies to y² = 1. Taking the square root of both sides, y = ±1.Therefore, the points of intersection are (√2, 1) and (√2, -1). Let's call these points A and B.Now, to find the length of segment AB, we can use the distance formula. Since both points have the same x-coordinate, the distance is simply the difference in their y-coordinates.So, the distance AB is |1 - (-1)| = |2| = 2.Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. The y-coordinates are 1 and -1, so the vertical distance between them is 2 units. Since the line is vertical, the distance is indeed just the difference in y-values. So, yes, AB should be 2 units long.Alternatively, using the distance formula: distance = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]. Here, x2 = x1 = √2, so (x2 - x1)² = 0. The y-coordinates are 1 and -1, so (y2 - y1)² = (1 - (-1))² = (2)² = 4. Therefore, distance = √4 = 2. Yep, that confirms it.Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier, let's recap:1. Hyperbola equation: x² - y² = 1. So, a² = 1, b² = 1.2. Foci at (±√(a² + b²), 0) = (±√2, 0).3. Vertical line through focus: x = √2.4. Substitute x = √2 into hyperbola: 2 - y² = 1 => y² = 1 => y = ±1.5. Points A(√2, 1) and B(√2, -1).6. Distance AB is 2.Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The key was recognizing that the line is vertical, so substitution is straightforward, and the distance is just the vertical difference.Another thing to consider: since the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, choosing either focus would result in the same length for AB. So, whether we take x = √2 or x = -√2, the points would be (-√2, 1) and (-√2, -1), and the distance would still be 2.Just to visualize, the hyperbola x² - y² = 1 has two branches opening to the left and right. The vertical line through the focus at (√2, 0) intersects the right branch at (√2, 1) and (√2, -1). The distance between these two points is purely vertical, hence the length is 2.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations.**Final Answer**The length of the line segment AB is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Suppose  m  and  n  are positive integers for which bullet  the sum of the first  m  multiples of  n  is  120 , and bullet  the sum of the first  m^3  multiples of  n^3  is  4032000 .Determine the sum of the first  m^2  multiples of  n^2 ","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the first ( m^2 ) multiples of ( n^2 ).

The sum of the first ( m ) multiples of ( n ) is 120.

Hmm, that's 12/7.Wait, 288 ÷ 168: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 24: 12 / 7.Yes, 288 ÷ 24 = 12; 168 ÷ 24 = 7.So, 12/7.Therefore, the equation becomes:[frac{12}{7} cdot frac{m^3 + 1}{(m + 1)^3} = 1]Multiply both sides by 7/12:[frac{m^3 + 1}{(m + 1)^3} = frac{7}{12}]So, now we have:[frac{m^3 + 1}{(m + 1)^3} = frac{7}{12}]Let me compute ( (m + 1)^3 ):( (m + 1)^3 = m^3 + 3m^2 + 3m + 1 )So, the equation becomes:[frac{m^3 + 1}{m^3 + 3m^2 + 3m + 1} = frac{7}{12}]Let me denote ( A = m^3 + 1 ) and ( B = m^3 + 3m^2 + 3m + 1 ), so ( A/B = 7/12 ).Cross-multiplying:( 12A = 7B )So,( 12(m^3 + 1) = 7(m^3 + 3m^2 + 3m + 1) )Let me expand both sides:Left side: ( 12m^3 + 12 )Right side: ( 7m^3 + 21m^2 + 21m + 7 )Bring all terms to left side:( 12m^3 + 12 - 7m^3 - 21m^2 - 21m - 7 = 0 )Simplify:( (12m^3 - 7m^3) + (-21m^2) + (-21m) + (12 - 7) = 0 )Which is:( 5m^3 - 21m^2 - 21m + 5 = 0 )So, the equation is:( 5m^3 - 21m^2 - 21m + 5 = 0 )Hmm, this is a cubic equation.

The possible rational roots are factors of 5 over factors of 5, so ±1, ±5, ±1/5.Let me test m=1:5(1)^3 -21(1)^2 -21(1) +5 = 5 -21 -21 +5 = -32 ≠0m=5:5(125) -21(25) -21(5) +5 = 625 -525 -105 +5 = (625 -525) + (-105 +5) = 100 -100 = 0Oh, m=5 is a root!So, (m -5) is a factor.Let me perform polynomial division or factor it out.Divide 5m^3 -21m^2 -21m +5 by (m -5).Using synthetic division:5 | 5  -21  -21   5Bring down the 5.Multiply 5 by 5: 25.

The vectors given are a = (2, -1, 1), b = (-1, 4, -2), and c = (11, 5, λ). Hmm, coplanar vectors... I remember that if three vectors are coplanar, the volume of the parallelepiped formed by them is zero. And the volume can be found using the scalar triple product of the vectors. So, the scalar triple product of a, b, and c should be zero. Let me recall the formula for the scalar triple product. It's a · (b × c), right? So, I need to compute the cross product of vectors b and c first, and then take the dot product of vector a with that result. If the result is zero, then the vectors are coplanar. Alright, let's write down the vectors again:a = (2, -1, 1)b = (-1, 4, -2)c = (11, 5, λ)First, I need to compute the cross product of b and c. The cross product of two vectors, say b = (b1, b2, b3) and c = (c1, c2, c3), is given by the determinant of a matrix with the standard unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of b in the second row, and the components of c in the third row. So, let me set that up.b × c = |i j k|        |-1 4 -2|        |11 5 λ|Calculating this determinant, it should be:i*(4*λ - (-2)*5) - j*(-1*λ - (-2)*11) + k*(-1*5 - 4*11)Let me compute each component step by step.First component (i):4*λ - (-2)*5 = 4λ + 10Second component (j):- [(-1)*λ - (-2)*11] = - [ -λ + 22 ] = λ - 22Wait, hold on. The cross product formula is:b × c = (b2c3 - b3c2, b3c1 - b1c3, b1c2 - b2c1)So, maybe it's better to compute each component using this formula to avoid confusion.So, using the formula:First component (i): b2c3 - b3c2 = 4*λ - (-2)*5 = 4λ + 10Second component (j): b3c1 - b1c3 = (-2)*11 - (-1)*λ = -22 + λThird component (k): b1c2 - b2c1 = (-1)*5 - 4*11 = -5 - 44 = -49So, putting it all together, the cross product b × c is:(4λ + 10, λ - 22, -49)Now, I need to take the dot product of vector a with this cross product. Vector a is (2, -1, 1). So, the dot product is:2*(4λ + 10) + (-1)*(λ - 22) + 1*(-49)Let me compute each term separately.First term: 2*(4λ + 10) = 8λ + 20Second term: (-1)*(λ - 22) = -λ + 22Third term: 1*(-49) = -49Now, add all these together:8λ + 20 - λ + 22 - 49Combine like terms:(8λ - λ) + (20 + 22 - 49) = 7λ + (42 - 49) = 7λ - 7Since the vectors are coplanar, this scalar triple product must be zero. So:7λ - 7 = 0Solving for λ:7λ = 7λ = 1Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, cross product:b × c = (4λ + 10, λ - 22, -49). That seems correct.Dot product with a:2*(4λ + 10) = 8λ + 20-1*(λ - 22) = -λ + 221*(-49) = -49Adding them up: 8λ + 20 - λ + 22 - 49 = 7λ + (20 + 22 - 49) = 7λ - 7. Yep, that's correct.Set equal to zero: 7λ - 7 = 0 => λ = 1.Hmm, seems straightforward. But wait, just to be thorough, let me verify by plugging λ = 1 back into vector c and checking if the scalar triple product is indeed zero.So, vector c becomes (11, 5, 1).Compute b × c again with λ = 1:First component: 4*1 + 10 = 4 + 10 = 14Second component: 1 - 22 = -21Third component: -49So, b × c = (14, -21, -49)Now, dot product with a = (2, -1, 1):2*14 + (-1)*(-21) + 1*(-49) = 28 + 21 - 49 = 49 - 49 = 0Perfect, it does equal zero. So, λ = 1 is indeed the correct value.Alternatively, another way to approach this problem is by using the determinant method. The scalar triple product is also the determinant of a matrix formed by the vectors a, b, and c as columns (or rows). So, setting up the determinant:| 2  -1   1 || -1  4  -2 ||11  5  λ |Computing this determinant should also give zero when the vectors are coplanar.Let me compute this determinant:2*(4*λ - (-2)*5) - (-1)*(-1*λ - (-2)*11) + 1*(-1*5 - 4*11)Compute each term:First term: 2*(4λ + 10) = 8λ + 20Second term: - (-1)*( -λ + 22 ) = - (λ - 22) = -λ + 22Third term: 1*(-5 - 44) = -49Adding them together: 8λ + 20 - λ + 22 - 49 = 7λ - 7, same as before.Set equal to zero: 7λ - 7 = 0 => λ = 1.So, same result. That gives me more confidence that λ = 1 is correct.I think I've considered it from two different angles: computing the cross product then the dot product, and computing the determinant directly. Both methods lead me to the same answer, so I feel confident that λ is indeed 1.**Final Answer**The value of λ is boxed{1}."},{"question":"In soccer, players receive yellow cards when they are cautioned and red cards when they are sent off.

It helps reduce the number of operations needed, especially for higher-degree polynomials. The method involves rewriting the polynomial in a nested form, which makes it easier to compute step by step.Given the polynomial ( f(x) = 3x^6 + 5x^5 + 6x^4 + 79x^3 - 8x^2 + 35x + 12 ), I need to evaluate this at ( x = -4 ). But the question specifically asks for ( v_3 ), which I think refers to the value obtained at the third step of Horner's method. So, I need to perform the method step by step and note the third intermediate value.Let me recall how Horner's method works. For a polynomial ( a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + dots + a_1x + a_0 ), we can rewrite it as ( (((((a_nx + a_{n-1})x + a_{n-2})x + dots )x + a_1)x + a_0) ). Then, we evaluate this nested expression step by step.So, for our polynomial, the coefficients are: 3, 5, 6, 79, -8, 35, 12. The degrees go from 6 down to 0, so the coefficients correspond to ( x^6 ) down to the constant term.Since we're evaluating at ( x = -4 ), let me set up the coefficients and the value of x.I think the process is as follows:Start with the leading coefficient, which is 3.Then, multiply by x (-4) and add the next coefficient.So, step by step:1. Start with 3.2. Multiply by -4: 3 * (-4) = -12. Then add the next coefficient, which is 5: -12 + 5 = -7. So, this is the first intermediate value, ( v_1 = -7 ).3. Multiply this result by -4: -7 * (-4) = 28. Then add the next coefficient, which is 6: 28 + 6 = 34. This is the second intermediate value, ( v_2 = 34 ).4. Multiply this result by -4: 34 * (-4) = -136. Then add the next coefficient, which is 79: -136 + 79 = -57. This is the third intermediate value, ( v_3 = -57 ).Wait, so is that it? So, ( v_3 ) is -57? Hmm, let me double-check my calculations.Starting with 3:1. 3 * (-4) + 5 = -12 + 5 = -7. Correct.2. -7 * (-4) + 6 = 28 + 6 = 34. Correct.3. 34 * (-4) + 79 = -136 + 79 = -57. Yes, that seems right.So, ( v_3 = -57 ). I think that's the answer for part (1).Moving on to problem (2): Convert the hexadecimal number ( 210_{(6)} ) into a decimal number.Wait, hold on. The subscript (6) indicates that this is a number in base 6, right? So, it's a base-6 number, and we need to convert it to decimal (base-10). The number is 210 in base 6.But just to be clear, hexadecimal usually refers to base 16, but here it says \\"hexadecimal number ( 210_{(6)} )\\". Hmm, maybe that's a typo or confusion in the question. Because hexadecimal would imply base 16, but the subscript is 6, which is base 6.Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking to convert a base-6 number into decimal. So, maybe it's a misnomer, or perhaps the question meant to say \\"convert the base-6 number 210 into decimal.\\" Because hexadecimal is base 16, but the subscript is 6, so that's conflicting.Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and they meant hexadecimal (base 16) with the number 210, but that would be written as 210_{16} or something. Since the subscript is 6, I think it's safer to assume that it's a base-6 number, 210, which needs to be converted into decimal.So, let's proceed with that assumption.To convert a base-6 number to decimal, we can expand it as follows:The number is 210 in base 6. So, from right to left, the digits represent 6^0, 6^1, 6^2, etc.So, starting from the right:- The rightmost digit is 0, which is in the 6^0 place.- The middle digit is 1, which is in the 6^1 place.- The leftmost digit is 2, which is in the 6^2 place.Therefore, the decimal value is:2 * 6^2 + 1 * 6^1 + 0 * 6^0Calculating each term:2 * 36 = 721 * 6 = 60 * 1 = 0Adding them up: 72 + 6 + 0 = 78.So, the decimal equivalent is 78.But just to make sure, let me verify the calculation:6^2 = 36, so 2 * 36 = 72.6^1 = 6, so 1 * 6 = 6.6^0 = 1, so 0 * 1 = 0.Total: 72 + 6 + 0 = 78. Yep, that's correct.Alternatively, if the number was indeed hexadecimal (base 16), then 210 in base 16 would be:2 * 16^2 + 1 * 16^1 + 0 * 16^0 = 2*256 + 1*16 + 0 = 512 + 16 = 528.But since the subscript is 6, I think the correct interpretation is base 6, so 78 is the answer.Wait, but the question says \\"hexadecimal number 210_{(6)}\\". Hmm, hexadecimal is base 16, but the subscript is 6. Maybe it's a typo and they meant base 16 with subscript 16? Or maybe it's a different numbering system.Alternatively, perhaps it's a mixed base or something else. But I think the safest assumption is that it's a base-6 number, given the subscript.So, I think 78 is the correct decimal conversion.But just to make sure, let me think again.Hexadecimal is base 16, so numbers go from 0-9 and then A-F for 10-15. But in the number 210_{(6)}, the digits are 2, 1, 0, which are all valid in base 6 (since base 6 digits go from 0-5). So, 210 in base 6 is a valid number, and converting it to decimal is 78.Therefore, I think the answer is 78.So, summarizing:Problem (1): Using Horner's method, the value ( v_3 ) when evaluating the polynomial at ( x = -4 ) is -57.Problem (2): Converting the base-6 number 210 into decimal gives 78.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{-57}(2) boxed{78}"},{"question":"Calculate the limit of the function:lim _{x rightarrow 0} frac{e^{4 x}-e^{-2 x}}{2 operatorname{arctg} x-sin x}","answer":"Okay, so I have this limit to calculate: lim _{x rightarrow 0} frac{e^{4 x}-e^{-2 x}}{2 operatorname{arctg} x-sin x}Hmm, let me see. I remember that when dealing with limits as x approaches 0, especially when both the numerator and denominator approach 0, L’Hôpital’s Rule might be useful. Let me check if that's the case here.First, let me evaluate the numerator and denominator separately as x approaches 0.For the numerator: ( e^{4x} - e^{-2x} ). When x is 0, ( e^{0} = 1 ), so the numerator becomes ( 1 - 1 = 0 ).For the denominator: ( 2 arctan x - sin x ). When x is 0, ( arctan 0 = 0 ) and ( sin 0 = 0 ), so the denominator is also 0.Okay, so we have a 0/0 indeterminate form. That means L’Hôpital’s Rule is applicable here. So, I can take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator and then take the limit again.Let me compute the derivatives.First, the derivative of the numerator: ( frac{d}{dx} [e^{4x} - e^{-2x}] ). The derivative of ( e^{4x} ) is ( 4e^{4x} ) because of the chain rule, and the derivative of ( -e^{-2x} ) is ( 2e^{-2x} ) since the derivative of ( e^{kx} ) is ( ke^{kx} ). So, putting it together, the derivative of the numerator is ( 4e^{4x} + 2e^{-2x} ).Now, the derivative of the denominator: ( frac{d}{dx} [2 arctan x - sin x] ).The derivative of ( 2 arctan x ) is ( 2 cdot frac{1}{1 + x^2} ) because the derivative of ( arctan x ) is ( frac{1}{1 + x^2} ). The derivative of ( -sin x ) is ( -cos x ). So, the derivative of the denominator is ( frac{2}{1 + x^2} - cos x ).So, applying L’Hôpital’s Rule, the limit becomes:lim _{x rightarrow 0} frac{4e^{4x} + 2e^{-2x}}{frac{2}{1 + x^2} - cos x}Now, let me evaluate this new limit as x approaches 0.First, plug in x = 0 into the numerator: ( 4e^{0} + 2e^{0} = 4(1) + 2(1) = 6 ).Now, the denominator: ( frac{2}{1 + 0} - cos 0 = 2 - 1 = 1 ).So, the limit becomes ( frac{6}{1} = 6 ).Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check because sometimes after applying L’Hôpital’s Rule once, we might still have an indeterminate form. Did I make a mistake?Wait, when I took the derivatives, the numerator became ( 4e^{4x} + 2e^{-2x} ) which at x=0 is 6, and the denominator became ( frac{2}{1 + x^2} - cos x ), which at x=0 is 2 - 1 = 1. So, 6/1 is 6. So, it seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me consider expanding both the numerator and denominator using Taylor series around x=0. Sometimes, using series expansions can give more insight or confirm the result.Starting with the numerator: ( e^{4x} - e^{-2x} ).The Taylor series for ( e^{kx} ) around 0 is ( 1 + kx + frac{(kx)^2}{2!} + frac{(kx)^3}{3!} + cdots ).So, expanding ( e^{4x} ):( e^{4x} = 1 + 4x + frac{(4x)^2}{2} + frac{(4x)^3}{6} + cdots = 1 + 4x + 8x^2 + frac{32x^3}{3} + cdots )Similarly, expanding ( e^{-2x} ):( e^{-2x} = 1 - 2x + frac{(-2x)^2}{2} + frac{(-2x)^3}{6} + cdots = 1 - 2x + 2x^2 - frac{8x^3}{6} + cdots )Subtracting these:( e^{4x} - e^{-2x} = (1 + 4x + 8x^2 + frac{32x^3}{3} + cdots) - (1 - 2x + 2x^2 - frac{8x^3}{6} + cdots) )Simplify term by term:1 - 1 = 04x - (-2x) = 6x8x^2 - 2x^2 = 6x^2( frac{32x^3}{3} - (-frac{8x^3}{6}) = frac{32x^3}{3} + frac{4x^3}{3} = frac{36x^3}{3} = 12x^3 )So, up to the third order, the numerator is approximately ( 6x + 6x^2 + 12x^3 ).Now, the denominator: ( 2 arctan x - sin x ).Let me recall the Taylor series for ( arctan x ) and ( sin x ).The Taylor series for ( arctan x ) around 0 is ( x - frac{x^3}{3} + frac{x^5}{5} - cdots ).So, ( 2 arctan x = 2x - frac{2x^3}{3} + cdots ).The Taylor series for ( sin x ) is ( x - frac{x^3}{6} + frac{x^5}{120} - cdots ).So, subtracting these:( 2 arctan x - sin x = (2x - frac{2x^3}{3} + cdots) - (x - frac{x^3}{6} + cdots) )Simplify term by term:2x - x = x( -frac{2x^3}{3} - (-frac{x^3}{6}) = -frac{2x^3}{3} + frac{x^3}{6} = -frac{4x^3}{6} + frac{x^3}{6} = -frac{3x^3}{6} = -frac{x^3}{2} )So, up to the third order, the denominator is approximately ( x - frac{x^3}{2} ).Putting it all together, the function becomes approximately:( frac{6x + 6x^2 + 12x^3}{x - frac{x^3}{2}} )We can factor out an x from numerator and denominator:( frac{x(6 + 6x + 12x^2)}{x(1 - frac{x^2}{2})} )Cancel out the x:( frac{6 + 6x + 12x^2}{1 - frac{x^2}{2}} )Now, as x approaches 0, the terms with x in the numerator and denominator become negligible, so the limit is approximately 6/1 = 6.So, both methods, L’Hôpital’s Rule and Taylor series expansion, give the same result, which is 6. That gives me more confidence that the limit is indeed 6.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute the limit numerically for a very small x, say x = 0.001.Compute numerator: e^{4*0.001} - e^{-2*0.001}Compute e^{0.004} ≈ 1 + 0.004 + (0.004)^2/2 + (0.004)^3/6 ≈ 1.004 + 0.000008 + 0.000000021 ≈ 1.004008021Compute e^{-0.002} ≈ 1 - 0.002 + (0.002)^2/2 - (0.002)^3/6 ≈ 0.998 + 0.000002 - 0.0000000013 ≈ 0.998002So, numerator ≈ 1.004008021 - 0.998002 ≈ 0.006006021Denominator: 2 arctan(0.001) - sin(0.001)Compute arctan(0.001) ≈ 0.001 - (0.001)^3/3 + ... ≈ 0.001 - 0.000000000333 ≈ 0.000999999666So, 2 arctan(0.001) ≈ 0.001999999333Compute sin(0.001) ≈ 0.001 - (0.001)^3/6 + ... ≈ 0.001 - 0.000000000166666 ≈ 0.000999999833So, denominator ≈ 0.001999999333 - 0.000999999833 ≈ 0.001Therefore, the function ≈ 0.006006021 / 0.001 ≈ 6.006021Which is approximately 6.006, very close to 6. So, this numerical approach also supports the result of 6.Therefore, I can confidently say that the limit is 6.**Final Answer**The limit is boxed{6}."},{"question":"A rectangular tile measures 3 inches by 4 inches. What is the fewest number of these tiles that are needed to completely cover a rectangular region that is 2 feet by 5 feet?","answer":"First, I need to convert the dimensions of the region from feet to inches because the tile measurements are in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the region is 24 inches by 60 inches.Next, I'll calculate the area of both the region and one tile. The area of the region is 24 inches multiplied by 60 inches, which equals 1,440 square inches. The area of one tile is 3 inches multiplied by 4 inches, totaling 12 square inches.To find out how many tiles are needed, I'll divide the area of the region by the area of one tile: 1,440 divided by 12 equals 120 tiles.Finally, I'll verify that the tiles can fit evenly along both the length and the width of the region.

( N ) is divisible by both 7 and 9","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a number N, which is given in base 8, is divisible by 7, 9, both, or neither. The number is (12345677654321)_8. Hmm, okay. I remember that to check divisibility, especially for numbers in different bases, there are some rules we can use, similar to how we have rules for base 10. First, let me recall that in base 8, each digit represents a power of 8. So, the rightmost digit is 8^0, then 8^1, 8^2, and so on. But since the number is quite long, converting it entirely to base 10 might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way to check divisibility without converting the entire number.I remember that for divisibility by 7 and 9 in base 10, we have specific rules, but I'm not sure how they translate to base 8. Maybe I can find similar rules for base 8. Alternatively, perhaps I can convert the number to base 10 and then apply the standard divisibility rules.Wait, let me think. Since 8 is a power of 2, and 7 is one less than 8, maybe there's a divisibility rule similar to the one for 9 in base 10. In base 10, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Similarly, in base 8, maybe a number is divisible by 7 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 7? That seems plausible because 8 ≡ 1 mod 7, so each digit's contribution is just its value times 1, so the total is the sum of the digits.Similarly, for divisibility by 9 in base 8, since 9 is one more than 8, maybe there's a rule similar to the alternating sum for 11 in base 10. Let me check that.Wait, actually, in base 10, the divisibility rule for 11 is based on the alternating sum of digits because 10 ≡ -1 mod 11. So, in base 8, for divisibility by 9, since 8 ≡ -1 mod 9, maybe the rule is similar: take the alternating sum of the digits.So, to summarize:- For divisibility by 7 in base 8: Sum all the digits and check if that sum is divisible by 7.- For divisibility by 9 in base 8: Take the alternating sum of the digits (i.e., subtract the second digit, add the third, subtract the fourth, etc.) and check if that result is divisible by 9.Okay, that seems like a plan. Let me try that.First, let's list out the digits of N in base 8. The number is (12345677654321)_8. So, writing out each digit from left to right:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.So, that's 14 digits in total. Let me count them: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,6,5,4,3,2,1. Yep, 14 digits.First, let's compute the sum of the digits for divisibility by 7.Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1.Let me compute this step by step:1 + 2 = 33 + 3 = 66 + 4 = 1010 + 5 = 1515 + 6 = 2121 + 7 = 2828 + 7 = 3535 + 6 = 4141 + 5 = 4646 + 4 = 5050 + 3 = 5353 + 2 = 5555 + 1 = 56.So, the sum of the digits is 56. Now, is 56 divisible by 7? Yes, because 7*8=56. So, N is divisible by 7.Okay, that's one part. Now, let's check divisibility by 9. For this, I need to compute the alternating sum of the digits.Since it's base 8, and 8 ≡ -1 mod 9, the rule should be similar to the alternating sum for 11 in base 10. So, starting from the right, we alternately add and subtract the digits. Wait, actually, does it matter which direction we start? Hmm.Wait, in base 10, the rule is to take the alternating sum from right to left because 10 ≡ -1 mod 11. Similarly, in base 8, since 8 ≡ -1 mod 9, the alternating sum should be taken from right to left as well. Let me confirm that.Yes, because each digit's place value alternates between positive and negative when considered modulo 9. So, starting from the right, the first digit (units place) is positive, the next (8^1 place) is negative, then positive, etc.So, let me write down the digits with their positions, starting from the right (position 0):Position: 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0Digits:    1  2  3  4 5 6 7 7 6 5 4 3 2 1Wait, actually, when considering the alternating sum, starting from the right, the positions go from 0 to 13. So, the rightmost digit is position 0, which is positive, position 1 is negative, position 2 is positive, etc.So, let me list the digits with their positions:Position: 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0Digits:    1  2  3  4 5 6 7 7 6 5 4 3 2 1Wait, actually, I think I might have messed up the positions. Let me clarify.When considering the number (12345677654321)_8, the rightmost digit is position 0, which is 1. Then moving left, position 1 is 2, position 2 is 3, and so on, up to position 13, which is the leftmost digit 1.So, the digits with their positions are:Position: 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0Digits:    1  2  3  4 5 6 7 7 6 5 4 3 2 1But for the alternating sum, starting from position 0 (rightmost), we alternate signs: position 0 is +, position 1 is -, position 2 is +, etc.So, let me write the digits with their signs:Position 13: 1 (position 13 is odd, so sign is (-1)^13 = -1)Position 12: 2 (position 12 is even, so sign is (+1))Position 11: 3 (position 11 is odd, sign is (-1))Position 10: 4 (position 10 is even, sign is (+1))Position 9: 5 (position 9 is odd, sign is (-1))Position 8: 6 (position 8 is even, sign is (+1))Position 7: 7 (position 7 is odd, sign is (-1))Position 6: 7 (position 6 is even, sign is (+1))Position 5: 6 (position 5 is odd, sign is (-1))Position 4: 5 (position 4 is even, sign is (+1))Position 3: 4 (position 3 is odd, sign is (-1))Position 2: 3 (position 2 is even, sign is (+1))Position 1: 2 (position 1 is odd, sign is (-1))Position 0: 1 (position 0 is even, sign is (+1))Wait, hold on, actually, the sign alternates starting from position 0 as positive. So, position 0: +, position 1: -, position 2: +, position 3: -, etc.But since the positions go from 0 to 13, the sign for position k is (-1)^k.So, for each digit, we multiply it by (-1)^k, where k is the position (starting from 0 on the right).Therefore, let me list each digit with its position and sign:Position 13: digit 1, sign (-1)^13 = -1Position 12: digit 2, sign (-1)^12 = +1Position 11: digit 3, sign (-1)^11 = -1Position 10: digit 4, sign (-1)^10 = +1Position 9: digit 5, sign (-1)^9 = -1Position 8: digit 6, sign (-1)^8 = +1Position 7: digit 7, sign (-1)^7 = -1Position 6: digit 7, sign (-1)^6 = +1Position 5: digit 6, sign (-1)^5 = -1Position 4: digit 5, sign (-1)^4 = +1Position 3: digit 4, sign (-1)^3 = -1Position 2: digit 3, sign (-1)^2 = +1Position 1: digit 2, sign (-1)^1 = -1Position 0: digit 1, sign (-1)^0 = +1So, now, let's compute each term:Position 13: 1 * (-1) = -1Position 12: 2 * (+1) = +2Position 11: 3 * (-1) = -3Position 10: 4 * (+1) = +4Position 9: 5 * (-1) = -5Position 8: 6 * (+1) = +6Position 7: 7 * (-1) = -7Position 6: 7 * (+1) = +7Position 5: 6 * (-1) = -6Position 4: 5 * (+1) = +5Position 3: 4 * (-1) = -4Position 2: 3 * (+1) = +3Position 1: 2 * (-1) = -2Position 0: 1 * (+1) = +1Now, let's add all these up step by step.Starting with 0:0 + (-1) = -1-1 + 2 = 11 + (-3) = -2-2 + 4 = 22 + (-5) = -3-3 + 6 = 33 + (-7) = -4-4 + 7 = 33 + (-6) = -3-3 + 5 = 22 + (-4) = -2-2 + 3 = 11 + (-2) = -1-1 + 1 = 0.So, the alternating sum is 0. Since 0 is divisible by 9, that means the number is divisible by 9.Wait, so both the sum of digits is 56, which is divisible by 7, and the alternating sum is 0, which is divisible by 9. Therefore, N is divisible by both 7 and 9.But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when adding and subtracting, it's easy to make a mistake.Let me list all the terms again:-1, +2, -3, +4, -5, +6, -7, +7, -6, +5, -4, +3, -2, +1.Let me group them in pairs to make it easier:(-1 + 2) = 1(-3 + 4) = 1(-5 + 6) = 1(-7 + 7) = 0(-6 + 5) = -1(-4 + 3) = -1(-2 + 1) = -1So, adding these results:1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = (1+1+1) + (0) + (-1-1-1) = 3 + 0 - 3 = 0.Yes, that confirms it. The alternating sum is indeed 0, which is divisible by 9.Therefore, N is divisible by both 7 and 9.Wait, but let me think again. Is the alternating sum method reliable for base 8 and modulus 9? Because 8 ≡ -1 mod 9, so each digit's place value alternates between 1 and -1 when considering modulo 9. So, the value of the number modulo 9 is equal to the alternating sum of its digits. Therefore, if the alternating sum is 0, then N ≡ 0 mod 9, so it's divisible by 9.Similarly, for divisibility by 7, since 8 ≡ 1 mod 7, each digit's place value is 1, so the total is the sum of the digits. Since the sum is 56, which is 0 mod 7, N is divisible by 7.Therefore, both statements are true: N is divisible by 7 and by 9.Wait, but let me confirm with another method just to be sure. Maybe converting a part of the number to base 10 and checking.But converting the entire number would be time-consuming, but perhaps I can compute N mod 7 and N mod 9 directly using the properties of modular arithmetic.For modulus 7:Since 8 ≡ 1 mod 7, each digit's place value is 1. Therefore, N mod 7 is equal to the sum of its digits mod 7. We already calculated the sum as 56, and 56 mod 7 is 0. So, N is divisible by 7.For modulus 9:Since 8 ≡ -1 mod 9, each digit's place value alternates between 1 and -1. Therefore, N mod 9 is equal to the alternating sum of its digits. We calculated that as 0, so N is divisible by 9.Therefore, both are true, so the correct answer is D.But just to be absolutely certain, maybe I can compute N mod 7 and N mod 9 using another approach.Alternatively, I can compute N mod 7 and N mod 9 by breaking down the number into parts.But considering the number is symmetric: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,6,5,4,3,2,1.Wait, that's interesting. The number is a palindrome in base 8. So, it reads the same forwards and backwards. That might help in some calculations, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can compute N mod 7 and N mod 9 by considering the contributions of each digit.But since we've already used the properties of 8 ≡ 1 mod 7 and 8 ≡ -1 mod 9, and the corresponding sums, I think our conclusion is solid.Therefore, I think the correct answer is D: N is divisible by both 7 and 9.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Kostya planted some number of tulip bulbs along a path. Then Tanya came and planted a new bulb between each pair of neighboring bulbs planted by Kostya. After that, Inna came and planted a new bulb between each pair of neighboring bulbs already planted. Finally, Dima came and did the same thing.All planted bulbs have grown and there are 113 blooming tulips. How many bulbs did Kostya plant?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Kostya, Tanya, Inna, and Dima each planted tulip bulbs in a sequence. Each person plants a new bulb between every pair of neighboring bulbs that were already there. In the end, there are 113 blooming tulips. I need to find out how many bulbs Kostya originally planted.Let me try to break this down step by step. Maybe I can model the process mathematically.First, let's denote the number of bulbs Kostya planted as ( n ). So, initially, there are ( n ) bulbs.Then, Tanya comes and plants a new bulb between each pair of neighboring bulbs. If there are ( n ) bulbs, there are ( n - 1 ) gaps between them. So, Tanya adds ( n - 1 ) bulbs. Therefore, after Tanya's planting, the total number of bulbs becomes ( n + (n - 1) = 2n - 1 ).Next, Inna comes and does the same thing. She plants a new bulb between each pair of neighboring bulbs. Now, how many bulbs are there before Inna plants? It's ( 2n - 1 ). So, the number of gaps is ( (2n - 1) - 1 = 2n - 2 ). Therefore, Inna adds ( 2n - 2 ) bulbs. The total number of bulbs after Inna's planting is ( (2n - 1) + (2n - 2) = 4n - 3 ).Then, Dima comes and does the same thing again. The number of bulbs before Dima plants is ( 4n - 3 ). So, the number of gaps is ( (4n - 3) - 1 = 4n - 4 ). Therefore, Dima adds ( 4n - 4 ) bulbs. The total number of bulbs after Dima's planting is ( (4n - 3) + (4n - 4) = 8n - 7 ).According to the problem, after all four have planted, there are 113 blooming tulips. So, the equation we have is:[ 8n - 7 = 113 ]Now, I need to solve for ( n ).Let me do that step by step.First, add 7 to both sides of the equation:[ 8n - 7 + 7 = 113 + 7 ][ 8n = 120 ]Then, divide both sides by 8:[ frac{8n}{8} = frac{120}{8} ][ n = 15 ]So, Kostya must have planted 15 bulbs.Wait, let me verify this to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with 15 bulbs:1. After Tanya plants: 15 + (15 - 1) = 15 + 14 = 29 bulbs.2. After Inna plants: 29 + (29 - 1) = 29 + 28 = 57 bulbs.3. After Dima plants: 57 + (57 - 1) = 57 + 56 = 113 bulbs.Yes, that adds up correctly. So, 15 is the right answer.But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to model this.Each time someone plants, they are effectively doubling the number of bulbs minus one. Wait, is that the case?Wait, when you have ( k ) bulbs, the next person adds ( k - 1 ) bulbs, so the total becomes ( k + (k - 1) = 2k - 1 ). So, each step is multiplying by 2 and subtracting 1.So, starting with ( n ):After Tanya: ( 2n - 1 )After Inna: ( 2(2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 2 - 1 = 4n - 3 )After Dima: ( 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 6 - 1 = 8n - 7 )Which is the same as before. So, the equation is correct.Therefore, solving ( 8n - 7 = 113 ) gives ( n = 15 ).I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The number of bulbs Kostya planted is boxed{15}."},{"question":"Let ( A, B, C ) be positive integers such that the number ( 1212017ABC ) is divisible by 45. Find the difference between the largest and the smallest possible values of the two-digit number ( AB ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the difference between the largest and smallest possible values of the two-digit number AB, where ABC are the last three digits of the number 1212017ABC. The catch is that this entire number has to be divisible by 45. Hmm, okay.First, let me recall what it means for a number to be divisible by 45. Since 45 is 9 multiplied by 5, the number must be divisible by both 9 and 5. So, I need to ensure that 1212017ABC is divisible by both 9 and 5. That gives me two separate conditions to check.Starting with divisibility by 5. I remember that a number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. So, looking at the number 1212017ABC, the last digit is C. Therefore, C must be either 0 or 5. That narrows down the possibilities for C.Now, moving on to divisibility by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. So, I need to calculate the sum of all the digits in 1212017ABC and make sure that sum is divisible by 9.Let me write down the number: 1 2 1 2 0 1 7 A B C. So, the digits are 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 7, A, B, C. Let me add up the known digits first.Calculating the sum of known digits:1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 7 = 1 + 2 is 3, plus 1 is 4, plus 2 is 6, plus 0 is still 6, plus 1 is 7, plus 7 is 14. So, the sum of the known digits is 14.Now, adding the unknown digits A, B, and C, the total sum becomes 14 + A + B + C. For the entire number to be divisible by 9, 14 + A + B + C must be a multiple of 9.So, 14 + A + B + C ≡ 0 mod 9. Which means, A + B + C ≡ (-14) mod 9. Let me compute -14 mod 9. Since 9*2=18, which is larger than 14, so 14 mod 9 is 5, so -14 mod 9 is equivalent to -5 mod 9, which is 4 mod 9. Therefore, A + B + C must be congruent to 4 mod 9. So, A + B + C = 4, 13, 22, etc. But since A, B, C are single digits (they are digits in the number), the maximum possible sum is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27. So, possible sums are 4, 13, 22.But wait, C is either 0 or 5. So, let's consider both cases.Case 1: C = 0Then, A + B + 0 = A + B must be congruent to 4 mod 9. So, A + B can be 4, 13, or 22. But since A and B are single digits (each from 0 to 9), the maximum A + B can be is 18. So, possible sums are 4 and 13.Case 2: C = 5Then, A + B + 5 must be congruent to 4 mod 9. So, A + B + 5 ≡ 4 mod 9 => A + B ≡ -1 mod 9 => A + B ≡ 8 mod 9. So, possible sums are 8, 17. Again, since A and B are single digits, maximum A + B is 18, so 8 and 17.So, summarizing:- If C = 0, A + B can be 4 or 13.- If C = 5, A + B can be 8 or 17.Now, the problem is asking for the difference between the largest and smallest possible values of the two-digit number AB. So, AB is a two-digit number, meaning A is the tens digit and B is the units digit. So, AB can range from 00 to 99, but since A, B, C are positive integers, wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says A, B, C are positive integers. Hmm, so A, B, C are positive integers, meaning they can be from 1 to 9, not 0 to 9. So, A, B, C are at least 1. That's an important point.So, correcting myself: A, B, C are positive integers, so each is from 1 to 9. So, in the case of C, it's either 0 or 5, but since C is positive, C must be 5. Wait, hold on. If C is a positive integer, then C can't be 0. So, C must be 5. Because 0 is not a positive integer. So, that changes things.Wait, hold on, let me check the problem statement again: \\"Let ( A, B, C ) be positive integers such that the number ( 1212017ABC ) is divisible by 45.\\" So, yes, A, B, C are positive integers, meaning they can't be zero. So, C can't be 0 because 0 isn't positive. Therefore, C must be 5.That simplifies things. So, C is fixed at 5. Therefore, we only have to consider the case where C = 5.So, going back to divisibility by 9: A + B + C must be congruent to 4 mod 9. Since C = 5, A + B + 5 ≡ 4 mod 9 => A + B ≡ -1 mod 9 => A + B ≡ 8 mod 9. So, A + B can be 8 or 17, as before.But since A and B are positive integers (1-9), let's see what possible values A + B can take.If A + B = 8: possible pairs (A,B) are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2), (7,1). So, AB can be 17, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62, 71.If A + B = 17: possible pairs (A,B) are (8,9), (9,8). So, AB can be 89 or 98.So, all possible AB values are 17, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62, 71, 89, 98.Now, the question is asking for the difference between the largest and smallest possible values of AB. So, let's list them in order:17, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62, 71, 89, 98.The smallest AB is 17, and the largest AB is 98.So, the difference is 98 - 17 = 81.Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.Wait, AB is a two-digit number, so 17 is 17, 26 is 26, up to 98. So, 98 - 17 is indeed 81.But hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss any possible AB values.When A + B = 8, the possible AB are:A=1, B=7: 17A=2, B=6: 26A=3, B=5: 35A=4, B=4: 44A=5, B=3: 53A=6, B=2: 62A=7, B=1: 71That's seven numbers.When A + B = 17, since A and B are at least 1, the only possibilities are A=8, B=9: 89 and A=9, B=8: 98.So, that's two more numbers.So, in total, 9 AB values: 17, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62, 71, 89, 98.So, the smallest is 17, the largest is 98, difference is 81.Wait, but hold on, is 17 a valid AB? Since A and B are positive integers, A=1, B=7 is acceptable because both are positive integers. Similarly, 98 is acceptable because A=9, B=8.So, yes, 17 is the smallest, 98 is the largest.Therefore, the difference is 98 - 17 = 81.But wait, let me just confirm that all these ABs satisfy the original condition. Let's pick a couple of examples.Take AB = 17, so the number is 1212017175. Let's check if it's divisible by 45.First, check divisibility by 5: last digit is 5, so yes.Check divisibility by 9: sum of digits.1+2+1+2+0+1+7+1+7+5.Calculating: 1+2=3, +1=4, +2=6, +0=6, +1=7, +7=14, +1=15, +7=22, +5=27. 27 is divisible by 9, so yes.Similarly, take AB=98: number is 1212017985.Sum of digits: 1+2+1+2+0+1+7+9+8+5.Calculating: 1+2=3, +1=4, +2=6, +0=6, +1=7, +7=14, +9=23, +8=31, +5=36. 36 is divisible by 9, so yes.So, both ends are valid. So, the difference is indeed 81.Wait, but the problem says \\"the difference between the largest and the smallest possible values of the two-digit number AB.\\" So, 98 - 17 is 81.Wait, but 98 - 17 is 81? Let me compute 98 - 17: 98 - 10 is 88, minus 7 is 81. Yes, correct.So, the answer should be 81.But just to make sure, let me think if there's any other possible AB that I might have missed.Wait, when A + B = 8, I considered all pairs from (1,7) to (7,1). That's seven numbers. When A + B = 17, only (8,9) and (9,8). So, that's two numbers. So, 7 + 2 = 9 numbers in total. So, I think I covered all possibilities.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as AB being a two-digit number, so A can be from 1 to 9, B from 1 to 9, but with A + B = 8 or 17.So, for A + B = 8, A can be 1-7, B correspondingly 7-1.For A + B = 17, A can be 8 or 9, B correspondingly 9 or 8.So, yeah, that's all.Therefore, the difference is 81.**Final Answer**boxed{81}"},{"question":"If the function y=cos (ωx- frac {π}{6})(ω > 0) has a minimum positive period of frac {π}{3}, then ω= _____ .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the function is y equals cosine of (omega x minus pi over 6), and they tell me that the minimum positive period is pi over 3. I need to find omega, and it's given that omega is greater than zero. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the general form of a cosine function is y equals cosine(Bx + C), right? And the period of such a function is given by 2pi divided by the absolute value of B. So in this case, my function is y equals cosine(omega x minus pi/6). So comparing this to the general form, B is omega, and C is negative pi over 6. So the period should be 2pi divided by omega.Wait, let me write that down to make sure I got it right. The period T is equal to 2pi divided by |B|. Since omega is positive, I don't have to worry about the absolute value. So T equals 2pi over omega.But the problem says the minimum positive period is pi over 3. So that means T is pi over 3. So I can set up the equation: 2pi over omega equals pi over 3.Let me write that equation:2π / ω = π / 3Okay, so now I need to solve for omega. Let's see. I can cross-multiply or just manipulate the equation. Let me multiply both sides by omega to get rid of the denominator on the left side. That gives me:2π = (π / 3) * ωHmm, so 2π equals (pi over 3) times omega. Now, I can solve for omega by dividing both sides by (pi over 3). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so that would be multiplying by 3 over pi.So, omega equals 2π multiplied by 3 over pi. Let me compute that:ω = 2π * (3 / π)Simplify this. The pi in the numerator and the pi in the denominator will cancel out, right? So that leaves me with 2 times 3, which is 6.Wait, so omega is 6? Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the period formula: T = 2π / ω. They say T is pi over 3. So 2π / ω = π / 3. Cross-multiplying gives 2π * 3 = ω * π. So 6π = ωπ. Then, dividing both sides by pi, we get omega equals 6. Yep, that seems right.Just to make sure, let me plug it back into the period formula. If omega is 6, then the period should be 2π / 6, which simplifies to π / 3. Exactly what the problem stated. So that checks out.So, I think I did that correctly. The key was remembering the period formula for cosine functions. It's easy to mix up the formula, thinking it's 2pi times omega or something else, but no, it's 2pi divided by omega. So that was crucial.Another thing to note is that the phase shift, which is the pi over 6 here, doesn't affect the period. It just shifts the graph left or right, but doesn't change how often it repeats. So that's why we can ignore the phase shift when calculating the period. That makes sense because the period is about how long it takes for the function to complete one full cycle, regardless of where it starts.So, in summary, the steps I took were:1. Recall the period formula for a cosine function: T = 2π / |B|.2. Identify B in the given function, which is omega.3. Set the given period equal to the formula: 2π / omega = pi / 3.4. Solve for omega by cross-multiplying and simplifying.5. Verify the result by plugging it back into the period formula.Everything seems to add up, so I feel confident that omega is indeed 6.**Final Answer**The value of ( omega ) is boxed{6}."},{"question":"Convert the binary number 110011_{(2)} to a decimal number.","answer":"First, I need to understand the place values of each digit in the binary number (110011_{(2)}).

I need to find the largest whole number value of n that makes this true. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this step by step.First, I remember that solving inequalities is similar to solving equations, but I have to be careful with the direction of the inequality, especially if I ever multiply or divide by a negative number. But in this case, I don't think that will happen, so I should be fine.So, the inequality is 1/3 + n/7 < 1. I want to solve for n. Let me write that down:1/3 + n/7 < 1I think the first step is to isolate the term with n. That means I need to get rid of the 1/3 on the left side. To do that, I can subtract 1/3 from both sides of the inequality. Let me do that:1/3 + n/7 - 1/3 < 1 - 1/3Simplifying both sides, the 1/3 and -1/3 on the left cancel each other out, so I have:n/7 < 1 - 1/3Now, I need to compute 1 - 1/3. I know that 1 is the same as 3/3, so subtracting 1/3 gives me 2/3. So now the inequality is:n/7 < 2/3Okay, so now I have n divided by 7 is less than 2/3. To solve for n, I need to get rid of the denominator 7. I can do that by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 7. Let me write that:7*(n/7) < 7*(2/3)Simplifying the left side, 7 divided by 7 is 1, so I have:n < 14/3Wait, 7 times 2/3 is 14/3. So, n is less than 14/3. Hmm, 14 divided by 3 is equal to 4 and 2/3, right? Because 3 goes into 14 four times with a remainder of 2. So, 14/3 is approximately 4.666...But the question asks for the largest whole number value of n that makes the inequality true. So, n has to be less than 4.666... The largest whole number less than 4.666 is 4. So, is 4 the answer?Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with fractions, it's easy to slip up.Starting again, the original inequality is 1/3 + n/7 < 1.Subtracting 1/3 from both sides: n/7 < 2/3.Multiplying both sides by 7: n < 14/3, which is approximately 4.666...So, yes, n must be less than 4.666..., so the largest whole number is 4. Let me test n=4 to see if it satisfies the inequality.Plugging n=4 into the original inequality: 1/3 + 4/7.Let me compute that. 1/3 is approximately 0.333..., and 4/7 is approximately 0.571...Adding them together: 0.333 + 0.571 is approximately 0.904, which is less than 1. So, that works.What about n=5? Let me check that too. If n=5, then 1/3 + 5/7.1/3 is about 0.333, and 5/7 is approximately 0.714.Adding them: 0.333 + 0.714 is approximately 1.047, which is greater than 1. So, n=5 doesn't satisfy the inequality.Therefore, n=4 is indeed the largest whole number that makes the inequality true.Wait, just to be thorough, let me compute the exact fractions instead of approximations to make sure.1/3 + 4/7. To add these, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 3 and 7 is 21.So, 1/3 is 7/21, and 4/7 is 12/21. Adding them together: 7/21 + 12/21 = 19/21.19/21 is less than 1 because 19 is less than 21. So, that's correct.Now, for n=5: 1/3 + 5/7.Again, converting to 21 denominators: 1/3 is 7/21, and 5/7 is 15/21. Adding them: 7/21 + 15/21 = 22/21.22/21 is equal to 1 and 1/21, which is definitely greater than 1. So, n=5 doesn't work.Therefore, n=4 is the correct answer.I think that's solid. I considered both approximate and exact values, checked the boundary cases, and made sure my steps were correct. So, yeah, n=4 is the largest whole number that satisfies the inequality.**Final Answer**The largest whole number value of ( n ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Calculate: (frac{7}{9}-frac{5}{6}+frac{5}{18})×18.","answer":"First, I need to calculate the expression inside the parentheses: (frac{7}{9} - frac{5}{6} + frac{5}{18}).To combine these fractions, I'll find a common denominator, which is 18.Converting each fraction:[frac{7}{9} = frac{14}{18}, quad frac{5}{6} = frac{15}{18}, quad frac{5}{18} = frac{5}{18}]Now, perform the arithmetic:[frac{14}{18} - frac{15}{18} + frac{5}{18} = frac{14 - 15 + 5}{18} = frac{4}{18} = frac{2}{9}]Next, multiply the result by 18:[frac{2}{9} times 18 = 4]"},{"question":"Given that points A(3, y_{1}) and B(m, y_{2}) are two points on the graph of the inverse proportion function y=frac{6}{x}, and y_{1} lt y_{2}. Write down one value of m that satisfies the conditions, m can be ____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where points A(3, y₁) and B(m, y₂) are on the graph of the inverse proportion function y = 6/x. It also says that y₁ is less than y₂, and I need to find a value for m that satisfies these conditions. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that an inverse proportion function has the form y = k/x, where k is a constant. In this case, k is 6, so the function is y = 6/x. That means for any point on this graph, the product of x and y is 6. So, for point A, which is (3, y₁), plugging into the equation, y₁ should be 6 divided by 3, right? Let me calculate that.y₁ = 6 / 3 = 2. So, point A is (3, 2). Got that down. Now, for point B, which is (m, y₂), plugging into the same equation, y₂ should be 6 divided by m. So, y₂ = 6/m. The problem states that y₁ < y₂. Since y₁ is 2, this means that 2 < y₂. Substituting y₂ with 6/m, we get 2 < 6/m. Now, I need to solve this inequality for m.Let me write that down: 2 < 6/m. To solve for m, I can multiply both sides by m, but wait, I have to be careful because if m is positive, the inequality sign remains the same, but if m is negative, the inequality sign flips. Hmm, so I need to consider the sign of m here.But before that, let me think about the graph of y = 6/x. It's a hyperbola with two branches, one in the first quadrant and one in the third quadrant. Since point A is at (3, 2), which is in the first quadrant, and point B is another point on the graph. Depending on the value of m, point B can be in the first or third quadrant.But since y₂ is greater than y₁, which is 2, and y₁ is positive, y₂ must also be positive because if m were negative, y₂ would be negative, which would make y₂ less than y₁, right? Because y₁ is 2, which is positive. So, if m is negative, y₂ would be negative, and 2 is greater than any negative number, which would contradict y₁ < y₂. Therefore, m must be positive.Okay, so m is positive. That simplifies things because I don't have to worry about flipping the inequality sign when multiplying both sides by m. So, starting with 2 < 6/m, and since m is positive, I can multiply both sides by m without changing the inequality direction.Multiplying both sides by m: 2m < 6. Then, divide both sides by 2: m < 3. So, m must be less than 3. But wait, m is the x-coordinate of point B, which is on the graph y = 6/x. So, m can't be zero because division by zero is undefined. So, m must be a positive number less than 3, but not zero.But hold on, let me verify this. If m is less than 3, say m = 2, then y₂ = 6/2 = 3, which is indeed greater than 2. If m is 1, y₂ = 6/1 = 6, which is also greater than 2. If m is approaching zero from the positive side, y₂ approaches infinity, which is definitely greater than 2. So, that seems consistent.But wait, what if m is greater than 3? Let's test m = 4. Then y₂ = 6/4 = 1.5, which is less than 2, which doesn't satisfy y₁ < y₂. So, m can't be greater than 3. So, m has to be less than 3 but positive.But hold on, is there another case where m is negative? Earlier, I thought that m can't be negative because y₂ would be negative, which is less than y₁. But let me confirm that. If m is negative, say m = -3, then y₂ = 6/(-3) = -2. Since y₁ is 2, which is positive, 2 is greater than -2, so y₁ > y₂, which doesn't satisfy y₁ < y₂. So, m can't be negative.Therefore, m must be a positive number less than 3. So, any positive number less than 3 would satisfy the condition. The question asks to write down one value of m that satisfies the conditions. So, I can choose any m between 0 and 3, not including 0 and 3.Let me think of a simple value. Maybe m = 1? Let's check: y₂ = 6/1 = 6, which is greater than 2. Yep, that works. Or m = 2, y₂ = 3, which is also greater than 2. Or m = 1.5, y₂ = 4, which is still greater than 2. So, any of these would work.Wait, but the problem says \\"one value of m\\". So, I just need to provide one such value. Since 1 is simple, I can go with that. Alternatively, maybe 2 is also a good choice. Let me just pick m = 1.But before finalizing, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. So, starting from y = 6/x, point A is (3, 2). For point B, (m, y₂), y₂ = 6/m. Given y₁ < y₂, so 2 < 6/m. Since m is positive, multiply both sides by m: 2m < 6, so m < 3. So, m must be less than 3 and positive. So, m can be 1, 2, 1.5, etc. So, yes, m = 1 is a valid answer.Alternatively, could m be equal to 3? If m = 3, then y₂ = 6/3 = 2, which is equal to y₁. But the condition is y₁ < y₂, so m can't be 3. Similarly, m can't be zero because division by zero is undefined. So, m must be in (0, 3). So, any number in that interval is acceptable.Therefore, one possible value is m = 1. Alternatively, m = 2 is also acceptable. I think I'll go with m = 1 because it's a whole number and straightforward.Wait, but just to make sure, let me test m = 1. So, point B would be (1, 6). So, y₂ = 6, which is indeed greater than y₁ = 2. So, that works. If I pick m = 2, y₂ = 3, which is also greater than 2. So, both are correct. Maybe I can also pick a fractional value, like m = 1.5, which would give y₂ = 4, still greater than 2.But the question just asks for one value, so any of these would suffice. Since 1 is the simplest, I'll stick with that.**Final Answer**One value of ( m ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given (0 < t_{1} leq t_{2} leq cdots leq t_{n} < 1).

Hmm, interesting. I need to show that this whole expression is less than 1. Let me try to break it down.First, let's understand the structure of the expression. There's a factor of ((1 - t_n)^2) multiplied by a sum of terms, each of which is of the form (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2}) for (k) from 1 to (n). So, the sum is over (k) from 1 to (n), and each term in the sum has (t_k) raised to the power (k), divided by ((1 - t_k^{k+1})^2).Given that all (t_k) are between 0 and 1, and each subsequent (t_k) is at least as large as the previous one. So, (t_1) is the smallest, and (t_n) is the largest, but still less than 1.I need to show that when you take this sum and multiply it by ((1 - t_n)^2), the result is less than 1.Let me think about each term in the sum. For each (k), the term is (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2}). Maybe I can find an upper bound for each of these terms, and then sum them up.Alternatively, perhaps I can use some inequality or telescoping series technique. Let's see.First, let me consider the term (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2}). Maybe I can find a way to relate this to something that telescopes when multiplied by ((1 - t_n)^2).Wait, another thought: since (t_1 leq t_2 leq cdots leq t_n), each (t_k) is less than or equal to (t_n). So, (t_k leq t_n) for each (k). Therefore, (t_k^{k+1} leq t_n^{k+1}). Hmm, but not sure if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can bound each term (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2}) by something simpler.Let me consider the denominator: (1 - t_k^{k+1}). Since (t_k < 1), (t_k^{k+1}) is positive but less than 1, so the denominator is less than 1, making the whole fraction larger than (t_k^k). So, each term in the sum is greater than (t_k^k), but we are multiplying by ((1 - t_n)^2), which is less than 1.Hmm, so maybe the product of a term greater than (t_k^k) and something less than 1. Not sure if that helps.Wait, perhaps I can use induction on (n). Let me try that.Base case: (n = 1). Then, the expression becomes:((1 - t_1)^2 cdot frac{t_1}{(1 - t_1^2)^2}).Simplify this:First, note that (1 - t_1^2 = (1 - t_1)(1 + t_1)). So, the denominator becomes ((1 - t_1)^2(1 + t_1)^2). Therefore, the expression becomes:((1 - t_1)^2 cdot frac{t_1}{(1 - t_1)^2(1 + t_1)^2} = frac{t_1}{(1 + t_1)^2}).Now, since (0 < t_1 < 1), ((1 + t_1)^2 > 1), so (frac{t_1}{(1 + t_1)^2} < t_1 < 1). So, the base case holds.Good, so for (n=1), the inequality is true.Now, assume that the inequality holds for some (n = m), i.e.,((1 - t_m)^2 left[ frac{t_1}{(1 - t_1^2)^2} + cdots + frac{t_m^m}{(1 - t_m^{m+1})^2} right] < 1).Now, consider (n = m + 1). Then, the expression becomes:((1 - t_{m+1})^2 left[ frac{t_1}{(1 - t_1^2)^2} + cdots + frac{t_m^m}{(1 - t_m^{m+1})^2} + frac{t_{m+1}^{m+1}}{(1 - t_{m+1}^{m+2})^2} right]).By the induction hypothesis, the sum up to (m) is less than (frac{1}{(1 - t_m)^2}). Wait, no, the induction hypothesis is that the entire expression up to (m) is less than 1. So, perhaps I need a different approach.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the sum as telescoping. Let me explore that.Looking at each term (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2}), perhaps I can write this as a difference of two terms, such that when multiplied by ((1 - t_n)^2), the sum telescopes.Wait, let me consider the derivative of some function. Hmm, or maybe integrating something.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inequality (1 - x geq e^{-x}) for (x < 1), but not sure.Wait, another idea: since (t_k leq t_n), maybe I can bound each term by replacing (t_k) with (t_n). But since (t_k leq t_n), (t_k^{k} leq t_n^{k}), but (t_k^{k+1} leq t_n^{k+1}), so the denominator (1 - t_k^{k+1} geq 1 - t_n^{k+1}). Therefore, each term (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2} leq frac{t_n^k}{(1 - t_n^{k+1})^2}).So, the entire sum is less than or equal to (sum_{k=1}^n frac{t_n^k}{(1 - t_n^{k+1})^2}).Therefore, the expression becomes:((1 - t_n)^2 cdot sum_{k=1}^n frac{t_n^k}{(1 - t_n^{k+1})^2}).Hmm, maybe this is easier to handle because now all terms have the same (t_n). Let me denote (t = t_n) for simplicity. So, the expression is:((1 - t)^2 cdot sum_{k=1}^n frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2}).I need to show that this is less than 1.Let me compute this sum for small (n) to see if I can find a pattern.For (n = 1), as before, it's (frac{t}{(1 - t^2)^2}), multiplied by ((1 - t)^2), which gives (frac{t}{(1 + t)^2}), which is less than 1.For (n = 2), the sum is (frac{t}{(1 - t^2)^2} + frac{t^2}{(1 - t^3)^2}). Multiply by ((1 - t)^2):First term: (frac{t}{(1 - t^2)^2} cdot (1 - t)^2 = frac{t}{(1 + t)^2(1 - t)^2} cdot (1 - t)^2 = frac{t}{(1 + t)^2}).Second term: (frac{t^2}{(1 - t^3)^2} cdot (1 - t)^2).Hmm, let's compute this:Note that (1 - t^3 = (1 - t)(1 + t + t^2)). So, the denominator becomes ((1 - t)^2(1 + t + t^2)^2). Therefore, the second term becomes:(frac{t^2}{(1 - t)^2(1 + t + t^2)^2} cdot (1 - t)^2 = frac{t^2}{(1 + t + t^2)^2}).So, the total expression is (frac{t}{(1 + t)^2} + frac{t^2}{(1 + t + t^2)^2}).Now, I need to show that this is less than 1.Let me denote (f(t) = frac{t}{(1 + t)^2} + frac{t^2}{(1 + t + t^2)^2}). I need to show (f(t) < 1) for (0 < t < 1).Compute (f(t)):First, note that (frac{t}{(1 + t)^2}) is less than (frac{1}{4}) when (t = 1), but actually, let's compute its maximum.The function (frac{t}{(1 + t)^2}) has its maximum at (t = 1), where it is (frac{1}{4}). Similarly, (frac{t^2}{(1 + t + t^2)^2}) is less than (frac{1}{9}) when (t = 1), but let's check.Wait, actually, for (t) approaching 0, both terms approach 0. For (t) approaching 1, the first term is (frac{1}{4}), the second term is (frac{1}{9}), so total is (frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{9} = frac{13}{36} < 1). So, seems like it's less than 1.But wait, is that always the case? Let me check for (t = 0.5):First term: (0.5 / (1.5)^2 = 0.5 / 2.25 ≈ 0.222).Second term: (0.25 / (1 + 0.5 + 0.25)^2 = 0.25 / (1.75)^2 ≈ 0.25 / 3.0625 ≈ 0.0816).Total ≈ 0.222 + 0.0816 ≈ 0.3036 < 1.Another point, (t = 0.8):First term: 0.8 / (1.8)^2 ≈ 0.8 / 3.24 ≈ 0.2469.Second term: 0.64 / (1 + 0.8 + 0.64)^2 = 0.64 / (2.44)^2 ≈ 0.64 / 5.9536 ≈ 0.1075.Total ≈ 0.2469 + 0.1075 ≈ 0.3544 < 1.So, seems like it's always less than 1. Maybe in general, for any (t), the sum is less than 1.But wait, how can I prove that?Alternatively, maybe I can find an upper bound for each term in the sum.Wait, another idea: since (1 - t^{k+1} geq 1 - t_n^{k+1}), but I already used that.Alternatively, perhaps I can note that (1 - t^{k+1} geq 1 - t_n), since (t^{k+1} leq t_n^{k+1} leq t_n) (since (t_n < 1), and exponentiation makes it smaller). Wait, no, (t_n^{k+1} leq t_n) because (t_n < 1) and (k+1 geq 2). So, yes, (1 - t^{k+1} geq 1 - t_n).Therefore, ((1 - t^{k+1})^2 geq (1 - t_n)^2). Therefore, (frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2} leq frac{t^k}{(1 - t_n)^2}).Therefore, the sum (sum_{k=1}^n frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2} leq sum_{k=1}^n frac{t^k}{(1 - t_n)^2} = frac{1}{(1 - t_n)^2} sum_{k=1}^n t^k).But (sum_{k=1}^n t^k = frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t}). So, the sum becomes (frac{t(1 - t^n)}{(1 - t)(1 - t_n)^2}).Therefore, the entire expression is:((1 - t_n)^2 cdot frac{t(1 - t^n)}{(1 - t)(1 - t_n)^2} = frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t}).Simplify this: (frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t} = t cdot frac{1 - t^n}{1 - t}).Note that (frac{1 - t^n}{1 - t} = 1 + t + t^2 + cdots + t^{n-1}). So, the expression becomes (t(1 + t + t^2 + cdots + t^{n-1})).Which is (t + t^2 + t^3 + cdots + t^n).So, the entire expression is equal to (t + t^2 + cdots + t^n). Since (t < 1), this is a geometric series with sum less than (frac{t}{1 - t}).But wait, (frac{t}{1 - t}) is greater than 1 when (t > 0.5), but in our case, (t = t_n < 1), but not necessarily less than 0.5.Wait, but actually, the sum (t + t^2 + cdots + t^n < frac{t}{1 - t}). So, if I can show that (frac{t}{1 - t} < 1), then the expression would be less than 1.But (frac{t}{1 - t} < 1) implies (t < 1 - t), which implies (2t < 1), so (t < 0.5). But (t_n) can be greater than 0.5, right? For example, (t_n = 0.6), then (frac{0.6}{1 - 0.6} = 1.5 > 1). So, that approach doesn't work because the upper bound I found can exceed 1.Hmm, so maybe that approach isn't sufficient.Wait, but in the previous step, I bounded the sum by (frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t}), which is less than (frac{t}{1 - t}). But since (frac{t}{1 - t}) can be greater than 1, that doesn't help.So, perhaps I need a better bound.Wait, another idea: instead of bounding each term by (frac{t^k}{(1 - t_n)^2}), maybe I can find a better bound for each term.Looking back at the term (frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2}), perhaps I can relate this to a telescoping series.Let me consider the function (f(x) = frac{x^k}{(1 - x^{k+1})^2}). Maybe integrating or differentiating something.Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as a derivative.Wait, let me consider the derivative of (frac{1}{1 - x^{k+1}}). The derivative is (frac{(k+1)x^k}{(1 - x^{k+1})^2}). So, (frac{x^k}{(1 - x^{k+1})^2} = frac{1}{(k+1)} cdot frac{d}{dx} left( frac{1}{1 - x^{k+1}} right)).Therefore, each term in the sum can be written as (frac{1}{k+1} cdot frac{d}{dx} left( frac{1}{1 - x^{k+1}} right)).So, the sum becomes:(sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{k+1} cdot frac{d}{dx} left( frac{1}{1 - x^{k+1}} right)).Hmm, but I'm not sure how this helps. Maybe integrating?Wait, perhaps integrating from 0 to t.Wait, let me think differently. Since each term is related to the derivative, maybe the sum can be expressed as a telescoping sum when multiplied by ((1 - t_n)^2).Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that (frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2}) is less than or equal to (frac{1}{(k+1)^2}), but not sure.Wait, another approach: consider the function (g(t) = frac{t}{(1 - t^2)^2}). Maybe I can find an integral representation or bound.Alternatively, think about the sum as a Riemann sum, but not sure.Wait, another idea: since (t_k leq t_n), and (t_n < 1), maybe I can use the fact that (1 - t_n^{k+1} geq 1 - t_n), so (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2} leq frac{t_n^k}{(1 - t_n)^2}).Therefore, the entire sum is less than or equal to (frac{1}{(1 - t_n)^2} sum_{k=1}^n t_n^k).Which is (frac{1}{(1 - t_n)^2} cdot frac{t_n(1 - t_n^n)}{1 - t_n}).Simplify: (frac{t_n(1 - t_n^n)}{(1 - t_n)^3}).Therefore, the entire expression is:((1 - t_n)^2 cdot frac{t_n(1 - t_n^n)}{(1 - t_n)^3} = frac{t_n(1 - t_n^n)}{1 - t_n}).Which is (t_n cdot frac{1 - t_n^n}{1 - t_n}).Again, (frac{1 - t_n^n}{1 - t_n} = 1 + t_n + t_n^2 + cdots + t_n^{n-1}).So, the expression becomes (t_n(1 + t_n + t_n^2 + cdots + t_n^{n-1})).Which is (t_n + t_n^2 + cdots + t_n^n).So, again, we have the same result as before: the expression is equal to (t_n + t_n^2 + cdots + t_n^n).But as I saw earlier, this sum is less than (frac{t_n}{1 - t_n}), which can be greater than 1 if (t_n > 0.5). So, this approach doesn't help because it doesn't give a bound less than 1.Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.Wait, perhaps instead of trying to bound each term, I can consider the entire expression and see if it's less than 1.Let me denote (S = sum_{k=1}^n frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2}).We need to show that ((1 - t_n)^2 S < 1).Alternatively, maybe I can consider the function (f(t) = frac{t}{(1 - t^2)^2}) and see if it's increasing or decreasing.Wait, compute the derivative of (f(t)):(f(t) = frac{t}{(1 - t^2)^2}).(f'(t) = frac{(1 - t^2)^2 cdot 1 - t cdot 2(1 - t^2)(-2t)}{(1 - t^2)^4}).Wait, let me compute it step by step.Using quotient rule: (f'(t) = frac{(1 - t^2)^2 cdot 1 - t cdot 2(1 - t^2)(-2t)}{(1 - t^2)^4}).Wait, no, more carefully:Numerator: (d/dt [t] = 1).Denominator: ((1 - t^2)^2).So, derivative is:(frac{1 cdot (1 - t^2)^2 - t cdot 2(1 - t^2)(-2t)}{(1 - t^2)^4}).Wait, no, wait: the derivative of the denominator is (2(1 - t^2)(-2t)), so using quotient rule:(f'(t) = frac{(1)(1 - t^2)^2 - t cdot 2(1 - t^2)(-2t)}{(1 - t^2)^4}).Simplify numerator:First term: ((1 - t^2)^2).Second term: (- t cdot 2(1 - t^2)(-2t) = 4t^2(1 - t^2)).So, numerator: ((1 - t^2)^2 + 4t^2(1 - t^2)).Factor out ((1 - t^2)):((1 - t^2)[(1 - t^2) + 4t^2] = (1 - t^2)(1 + 3t^2)).Therefore, (f'(t) = frac{(1 - t^2)(1 + 3t^2)}{(1 - t^2)^4} = frac{1 + 3t^2}{(1 - t^2)^3}).Since (1 + 3t^2 > 0) and ((1 - t^2)^3 > 0) for (t < 1), (f'(t) > 0). So, (f(t)) is increasing on (0 < t < 1).Similarly, for each (k), the function (frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2}) is increasing in (t) for (t) in (0 < t < 1). Because as (t) increases, the numerator increases and the denominator decreases, making the whole expression increase.Therefore, since (t_k leq t_n), each term (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2} leq frac{t_n^k}{(1 - t_n^{k+1})^2}).Therefore, the sum (S leq sum_{k=1}^n frac{t_n^k}{(1 - t_n^{k+1})^2}).So, the expression becomes:((1 - t_n)^2 cdot S leq (1 - t_n)^2 cdot sum_{k=1}^n frac{t_n^k}{(1 - t_n^{k+1})^2}).But as I saw earlier, this sum is equal to (t_n + t_n^2 + cdots + t_n^n), which is less than (frac{t_n}{1 - t_n}). But as I saw, this can be greater than 1, so this approach doesn't help.Wait, maybe I can consider that (t_n < 1), so (t_n + t_n^2 + cdots + t_n^n < frac{t_n}{1 - t_n}), but (frac{t_n}{1 - t_n}) is less than 1 only if (t_n < 0.5). So, not helpful.Wait, another idea: perhaps instead of trying to bound the entire sum, I can consider that each term in the sum is less than (frac{1}{(k+1)^2}), but I'm not sure.Wait, let me test for (n=2). As I did earlier, the expression is (frac{t}{(1 + t)^2} + frac{t^2}{(1 + t + t^2)^2}). Let me compute its maximum.Let me set (f(t) = frac{t}{(1 + t)^2} + frac{t^2}{(1 + t + t^2)^2}).Compute derivative (f'(t)):First term: (d/dt [t/(1 + t)^2] = frac{(1 + t)^2 - t cdot 2(1 + t)}{(1 + t)^4} = frac{1 + 2t + t^2 - 2t - 2t^2}{(1 + t)^4} = frac{1 - t^2}{(1 + t)^4}).Second term: (d/dt [t^2/(1 + t + t^2)^2]).Let me compute this:Let (u = t^2), (v = (1 + t + t^2)^2).Then, derivative is (frac{2t(1 + t + t^2)^2 - t^2 cdot 2(1 + t + t^2)(1 + 2t)}{(1 + t + t^2)^4}).Simplify numerator:Factor out (2(1 + t + t^2)):(2(1 + t + t^2)[t(1 + t + t^2) - t^2(1 + 2t)]).Compute inside the brackets:(t(1 + t + t^2) - t^2(1 + 2t) = t + t^2 + t^3 - t^2 - 2t^3 = t - t^3).So, numerator: (2(1 + t + t^2)(t - t^3)).Therefore, derivative is (frac{2(1 + t + t^2)(t - t^3)}{(1 + t + t^2)^4} = frac{2(t - t^3)}{(1 + t + t^2)^3}).So, overall, (f'(t) = frac{1 - t^2}{(1 + t)^4} + frac{2(t - t^3)}{(1 + t + t^2)^3}).Set (f'(t) = 0):(frac{1 - t^2}{(1 + t)^4} + frac{2(t - t^3)}{(1 + t + t^2)^3} = 0).This seems complicated to solve analytically. Maybe I can check the behavior.At (t = 0), (f'(0) = 1 + 0 = 1 > 0).As (t) approaches 1, let's see:First term: (frac{1 - 1}{(2)^4} = 0).Second term: (frac{2(1 - 1)}{(1 + 1 + 1)^3} = 0).But near (t = 1), let's take (t = 0.9):First term: (frac{1 - 0.81}{(1.9)^4} ≈ frac{0.19}{13.0321} ≈ 0.0146).Second term: (frac{2(0.9 - 0.729)}{(1 + 0.9 + 0.81)^3} ≈ frac{2(0.171)}{(2.71)^3} ≈ frac{0.342}{19.99} ≈ 0.0171).So, total (f'(0.9) ≈ 0.0146 + 0.0171 ≈ 0.0317 > 0).So, derivative is positive near (t = 1). Therefore, the function (f(t)) is increasing on (0 < t < 1). Therefore, its maximum is at (t = 1), which is (frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{9} ≈ 0.25 + 0.111 ≈ 0.361 < 1).Therefore, for (n=2), the expression is less than 1.Similarly, for higher (n), maybe the expression is always less than 1.But how to generalize this?Wait, perhaps I can consider that each term in the sum is less than (frac{1}{(k+1)^2}), but not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use mathematical induction with a better approach.Wait, let's try induction again.Assume that for (n = m), the inequality holds:((1 - t_m)^2 left[ frac{t_1}{(1 - t_1^2)^2} + cdots + frac{t_m^m}{(1 - t_m^{m+1})^2} right] < 1).Now, for (n = m + 1), we have:((1 - t_{m+1})^2 left[ text{sum up to } m + frac{t_{m+1}^{m+1}}{(1 - t_{m+1}^{m+2})^2} right]).By the induction hypothesis, the sum up to (m) is less than (frac{1}{(1 - t_m)^2}). But (t_{m+1} geq t_m), so (1 - t_{m+1} leq 1 - t_m). Therefore, (frac{1}{(1 - t_m)^2} leq frac{1}{(1 - t_{m+1})^2}).Therefore, the sum up to (m) is less than (frac{1}{(1 - t_{m+1})^2}).Therefore, the entire expression for (n = m + 1) is less than:((1 - t_{m+1})^2 left[ frac{1}{(1 - t_{m+1})^2} + frac{t_{m+1}^{m+1}}{(1 - t_{m+1}^{m+2})^2} right] = 1 + frac{t_{m+1}^{m+1}(1 - t_{m+1})^2}{(1 - t_{m+1}^{m+2})^2}).Now, I need to show that this is less than 1, but wait, it's (1 + text{something positive}), which would be greater than 1. So, this approach doesn't work because the induction step fails.Hmm, so maybe induction isn't the right way.Wait, another idea: perhaps I can use the fact that each term (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2}) is less than (frac{1}{(k+1)^2}).Wait, let me test for (k=1):(frac{t}{(1 - t^2)^2}). If (t = 1/2), then (frac{1/2}{(1 - 1/4)^2} = frac{1/2}{(3/4)^2} = frac{1/2}{9/16} = 8/9 ≈ 0.888 < 1).But for (t) approaching 1, (frac{t}{(1 - t^2)^2}) approaches infinity, so that term can be larger than 1. So, that idea doesn't hold.Wait, but in our case, the entire sum is multiplied by ((1 - t_n)^2), which is less than 1. So, maybe the product is still less than 1.Wait, but as (t_n) approaches 1, ((1 - t_n)^2) approaches 0, but the sum may approach infinity. So, maybe the product remains less than 1.Wait, let me consider (t_n) approaching 1. Let me set (t_n = 1 - epsilon), where (epsilon) is small.Then, (1 - t_n = epsilon), so ((1 - t_n)^2 = epsilon^2).Now, each term in the sum:For (k = n), (frac{t_n^n}{(1 - t_n^{n+1})^2}).Compute (t_n^{n+1} = (1 - epsilon)^{n+1} ≈ 1 - (n+1)epsilon).So, (1 - t_n^{n+1} ≈ (n+1)epsilon).Therefore, the term is approximately (frac{(1 - epsilon)^n}{[(n+1)epsilon]^2} ≈ frac{1}{(n+1)^2 epsilon^2}).So, the entire sum is approximately (frac{1}{(n+1)^2 epsilon^2}), and multiplying by (epsilon^2) gives (frac{1}{(n+1)^2}), which is less than 1.Therefore, as (t_n) approaches 1, the expression approaches (frac{1}{(n+1)^2}), which is less than 1.Similarly, for other (k), the terms are smaller because (t_k leq t_n), so their contributions are even smaller.Therefore, near (t_n = 1), the expression is less than 1.At (t_n = 0), the expression is 0, which is less than 1.So, maybe the expression is always less than 1.But how to formalize this?Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each (k), (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2} leq frac{1}{(k+1)^2}).Wait, let me test for (k=1):(frac{t}{(1 - t^2)^2} leq 1).But as (t) approaches 1, this term approaches infinity, so it's not bounded by 1.But when multiplied by ((1 - t_n)^2), which is small, maybe the product is still less than 1.Wait, perhaps I can use the inequality (frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2} leq frac{1}{(k+1)^2}) for (0 < t < 1).Wait, let me see for (t = 1/2) and (k=1):(frac{1/2}{(1 - 1/4)^2} = frac{1/2}{(3/4)^2} = frac{1/2}{9/16} = 8/9 ≈ 0.888 < 1).For (k=2):(frac{(1/2)^2}{(1 - (1/2)^3)^2} = frac{1/4}{(1 - 1/8)^2} = frac{1/4}{(7/8)^2} = frac{1/4}{49/64} = 16/49 ≈ 0.3265 < 1/9 ≈ 0.111). Wait, no, 16/49 ≈ 0.3265 > 1/9.So, the inequality (frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2} leq frac{1}{(k+1)^2}) doesn't hold for all (k) and (t).Therefore, that approach doesn't work.Wait, another idea: perhaps use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.But I'm not sure how to apply it here.Alternatively, maybe consider that each term (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2}) can be written as (left( frac{t_k^{k/2}}{1 - t_k^{k+1}} right)^2).Then, the sum becomes (sum_{k=1}^n left( frac{t_k^{k/2}}{1 - t_k^{k+1}} right)^2).Then, by Cauchy-Schwarz, (sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 leq left( sum_{k=1}^n a_k right)^2), but not sure.Alternatively, maybe use the inequality that (sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 leq left( sum_{k=1}^n a_k right)^2), but that's not generally true.Wait, actually, the opposite is true: (left( sum a_k right)^2 leq n sum a_k^2). So, not helpful.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2} leq frac{1}{(k+1)^2}) for (t_k leq frac{k}{k+1}). But not sure.Alternatively, maybe consider that (1 - t_k^{k+1} geq 1 - t_k), since (t_k^{k+1} leq t_k) for (t_k < 1) and (k geq 1). So, (1 - t_k^{k+1} geq 1 - t_k).Therefore, (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2} leq frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k)^2}).So, the sum (S leq sum_{k=1}^n frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k)^2}).But since (t_k leq t_n), (1 - t_k geq 1 - t_n), so (frac{1}{(1 - t_k)^2} leq frac{1}{(1 - t_n)^2}).Therefore, (S leq frac{1}{(1 - t_n)^2} sum_{k=1}^n t_k^k).But (sum_{k=1}^n t_k^k leq sum_{k=1}^n t_n^k = frac{t_n(1 - t_n^n)}{1 - t_n}).Therefore, (S leq frac{t_n(1 - t_n^n)}{(1 - t_n)^3}).Thus, the entire expression is:((1 - t_n)^2 cdot S leq (1 - t_n)^2 cdot frac{t_n(1 - t_n^n)}{(1 - t_n)^3} = frac{t_n(1 - t_n^n)}{1 - t_n}).Which is (t_n + t_n^2 + cdots + t_n^n), as before.But as I saw earlier, this sum is less than (frac{t_n}{1 - t_n}), which can be greater than 1. So, this approach doesn't work.Wait, but maybe I can consider that (t_n + t_n^2 + cdots + t_n^n < 1) for (t_n < 1). Is that true?Wait, no. For example, if (t_n = 0.9) and (n = 10), the sum is (0.9 + 0.81 + cdots + 0.9^{10}), which is approximately 6.20, which is greater than 1.So, that approach is invalid.Wait, but in our case, the sum is multiplied by ((1 - t_n)^2), which is small when (t_n) is close to 1. So, maybe the product is still less than 1.Wait, let me compute for (t_n = 0.9) and (n = 10):Sum: (0.9 + 0.81 + cdots + 0.9^{10} ≈ 6.20).Multiply by ((1 - 0.9)^2 = 0.01): (6.20 times 0.01 = 0.062 < 1).Similarly, for (t_n = 0.99) and (n = 100):Sum: approximately (frac{0.99}{1 - 0.99} = 99), but actually, it's a finite sum, so less than 99. Let's say approximately 99.Multiply by ((1 - 0.99)^2 = 0.0001): (99 times 0.0001 = 0.0099 < 1).So, even though the sum can be large, multiplying by ((1 - t_n)^2) makes it small.Therefore, maybe the product is always less than 1.But how to formalize this?Wait, perhaps I can note that for each (k), (t_k^{k} leq t_n^{k}), and (1 - t_k^{k+1} geq 1 - t_n^{k+1}).Therefore, (frac{t_k^k}{(1 - t_k^{k+1})^2} leq frac{t_n^k}{(1 - t_n^{k+1})^2}).So, the sum (S leq sum_{k=1}^n frac{t_n^k}{(1 - t_n^{k+1})^2}).Now, let me consider the function (f(t) = sum_{k=1}^infty frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2}).If I can show that this sum converges to something less than (frac{1}{(1 - t)^2}), then multiplying by ((1 - t)^2) would give less than 1.But I'm not sure about the convergence.Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for each (k), (frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2} leq frac{1}{(k+1)^2}), but as I saw earlier, this isn't true for all (k) and (t).Wait, another idea: consider that (frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2} leq frac{1}{(k+1)^2}) for (t leq frac{k}{k+1}). But not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use the inequality (1 - t^{k+1} geq (k+1)(1 - t)), which is from the inequality (1 - x^n geq n(1 - x)) for (x leq 1).Wait, actually, for (0 < x < 1), (1 - x^n geq n(1 - x)). Is that true?Let me check for (n=2): (1 - x^2 geq 2(1 - x)).(1 - x^2 - 2 + 2x geq 0).(-x^2 + 2x -1 geq 0).(-(x^2 - 2x + 1) = -(x - 1)^2 geq 0).Which is only true when (x = 1), but for (x < 1), it's negative. So, the inequality (1 - x^n geq n(1 - x)) is not true for all (x < 1).Therefore, that approach doesn't work.Wait, perhaps I can use the inequality (1 - t^{k+1} geq 1 - t), since (t^{k+1} leq t) for (t < 1) and (k geq 1).Therefore, (frac{t^k}{(1 - t^{k+1})^2} leq frac{t^k}{(1 - t)^2}).So, the sum (S leq frac{1}{(1 - t)^2} sum_{k=1}^n t^k = frac{1}{(1 - t)^2} cdot frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t} = frac{t(1 - t^n)}{(1 - t)^3}).Therefore, the entire expression is:((1 - t)^2 cdot S leq (1 - t)^2 cdot frac{t(1 - t^n)}{(1 - t)^3} = frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t}).Which is (t + t^2 + cdots + t^n), as before.But as I saw, this sum is less than (frac{t}{1 - t}), which can be greater than 1.But when multiplied by ((1 - t)^2), it becomes (frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t}), which is less than (frac{t}{1 - t}).But (frac{t}{1 - t}) is less than 1 only if (t < 0.5). So, for (t geq 0.5), this doesn't hold.But wait, in our case, the expression is (frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t}), which is less than (frac{t}{1 - t}).But (frac{t}{1 - t}) is greater than 1 when (t > 0.5). So, this approach doesn't help.Wait, but in reality, the expression is (frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t}), which is less than (frac{t}{1 - t}), but we need to show it's less than 1.So, maybe I can show that (frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t} < 1).Let me rearrange this inequality:(t(1 - t^n) < 1 - t).Multiply both sides by (1 - t) (which is positive since (t < 1)):(t(1 - t^n)(1 - t) < (1 - t)^2).Wait, no, that's not helpful.Wait, let me write the inequality:(t(1 - t^n) < 1 - t).Bring all terms to one side:(t(1 - t^n) + t - 1 < 0).Simplify:(t - t^{n+1} + t - 1 = 2t - t^{n+1} - 1 < 0).So, (2t - t^{n+1} - 1 < 0).Let me denote (g(t) = 2t - t^{n+1} - 1). I need to show that (g(t) < 0) for (0 < t < 1).Compute (g(0) = -1 < 0).Compute (g(1) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0).Compute derivative (g'(t) = 2 - (n+1)t^n).Set (g'(t) = 0):(2 - (n+1)t^n = 0).So, (t = left( frac{2}{n+1} right)^{1/n}).Since (n geq 1), (left( frac{2}{n+1} right)^{1/n}) is less than 1 for (n geq 1).Therefore, (g(t)) has a critical point at (t = left( frac{2}{n+1} right)^{1/n}).Compute (g) at this point:(gleft( left( frac{2}{n+1} right)^{1/n} right) = 2 left( frac{2}{n+1} right)^{1/n} - left( frac{2}{n+1} right)^{(n+1)/n} - 1).This seems complicated, but let's see for (n=1):(g(t) = 2t - t^2 - 1).Critical point at (t = sqrt{2/2} = 1). So, (g(1) = 0).For (n=2):Critical point at (t = (2/3)^{1/2} ≈ 0.816).Compute (g(0.816) ≈ 2*0.816 - (0.816)^3 - 1 ≈ 1.632 - 0.543 - 1 ≈ -0.911 < 0).So, the maximum of (g(t)) is at (t=1), where it's 0, and elsewhere it's less than 0.Therefore, (g(t) < 0) for (0 < t < 1), which implies that (2t - t^{n+1} - 1 < 0), hence (t(1 - t^n) < 1 - t), which implies (frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t} < 1).Therefore, (frac{t(1 - t^n)}{1 - t} < 1), which means that the expression ((1 - t_n)^2 S < 1).Therefore, the original inequality holds.So, putting it all together:We showed that each term in the sum is less than or equal to (frac{t_n^k}{(1 - t_n^{k+1})^2}), leading to the sum being less than (frac{t_n(1 - t_n^n)}{(1 - t_n)^2}). Multiplying by ((1 - t_n)^2) gives (frac{t_n(1 - t_n^n)}{1 - t_n}), which we showed is less than 1 by considering the function (g(t)) and showing it's negative for (0 < t < 1).Therefore, the original inequality holds."},{"question":"The perimeter of a rhombus is 2 m, and the lengths of its diagonals are in the ratio 3:4. Find the area of the rhombus.","answer":"First, I recognize that the perimeter of a rhombus is the sum of all its sides. Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, I can find the length of one side by dividing the perimeter by four.Next, I know that the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles and bisect each other. Given the ratio of the diagonals is 3:4, I can represent the lengths of the diagonals as 3x and 4x, where x is a common multiplier.Using the Pythagorean theorem, I can relate the side length of the rhombus to half of each diagonal. This allows me to solve for x, which in turn gives me the exact lengths of the diagonals.Finally, the area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula that involves the product of its diagonals. By plugging in the values of the diagonals, I can determine the area of the rhombus."},{"question":"Given (alpha, beta in left(0, frac{pi}{2}right)), (sin beta = 2 cos (alpha + beta) cdot sin alpha left(alpha + beta neq frac{pi}{2}right)), find the maximum value of (tan beta).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of (tan beta) given that (alpha) and (beta) are between 0 and (frac{pi}{2}), and they satisfy the equation (sin beta = 2 cos (alpha + beta) cdot sin alpha). Also, it's given that (alpha + beta neq frac{pi}{2}). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down the given equation:[sin beta = 2 cos (alpha + beta) cdot sin alpha]I need to find the maximum of (tan beta). So, maybe I can express everything in terms of (beta) or (alpha) and then find the maximum.Let me see if I can manipulate the equation to express (tan beta). Let's start by expanding (cos(alpha + beta)) using the cosine addition formula:[cos(alpha + beta) = cos alpha cos beta - sin alpha sin beta]So, substituting this back into the original equation:[sin beta = 2 (cos alpha cos beta - sin alpha sin beta) cdot sin alpha]Let me expand the right-hand side:[sin beta = 2 cos alpha cos beta sin alpha - 2 sin^2 alpha sin beta]Hmm, so now I have:[sin beta + 2 sin^2 alpha sin beta = 2 cos alpha cos beta sin alpha]Factor out (sin beta) on the left side:[sin beta (1 + 2 sin^2 alpha) = 2 cos alpha cos beta sin alpha]Now, let me divide both sides by (cos beta) to get:[sin beta (1 + 2 sin^2 alpha) / cos beta = 2 cos alpha sin alpha]Which simplifies to:[tan beta (1 + 2 sin^2 alpha) = 2 cos alpha sin alpha]So, solving for (tan beta):[tan beta = frac{2 cos alpha sin alpha}{1 + 2 sin^2 alpha}]Hmm, okay, so now I have (tan beta) expressed in terms of (alpha). Let me denote (x = sin alpha) for simplicity, since (alpha) is between 0 and (frac{pi}{2}), so (x) will be between 0 and 1.Then, (cos alpha = sqrt{1 - x^2}). So, substituting back into the expression for (tan beta):[tan beta = frac{2 sqrt{1 - x^2} cdot x}{1 + 2 x^2}]So, now I have (tan beta) as a function of (x):[f(x) = frac{2x sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 + 2x^2}]Now, I need to find the maximum value of (f(x)) for (x in (0, 1)). To find the maximum, I can take the derivative of (f(x)) with respect to (x), set it equal to zero, and solve for (x).Let me compute (f'(x)). First, let me write (f(x)) as:[f(x) = 2x (1 - x^2)^{1/2} (1 + 2x^2)^{-1}]So, to take the derivative, I'll use the product rule and chain rule. Let me denote:(u = 2x), (v = (1 - x^2)^{1/2}), and (w = (1 + 2x^2)^{-1}).But maybe it's better to use logarithmic differentiation or just apply the product rule step by step.Alternatively, let me set (f(x) = frac{2x sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 + 2x^2}), so I can write this as:[f(x) = frac{2x (1 - x^2)^{1/2}}{1 + 2x^2}]Let me compute the derivative using the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that if (f(x) = frac{g(x)}{h(x)}), then (f'(x) = frac{g'(x) h(x) - g(x) h'(x)}{[h(x)]^2}).So, let me define:(g(x) = 2x (1 - x^2)^{1/2})(h(x) = 1 + 2x^2)First, compute (g'(x)):Using the product rule on (g(x)):(g'(x) = 2 (1 - x^2)^{1/2} + 2x cdot frac{d}{dx} (1 - x^2)^{1/2})Compute the derivative of ((1 - x^2)^{1/2}):[frac{d}{dx} (1 - x^2)^{1/2} = frac{1}{2} (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} (-2x) = -frac{x}{sqrt{1 - x^2}}]So, substituting back into (g'(x)):[g'(x) = 2 (1 - x^2)^{1/2} + 2x left( -frac{x}{sqrt{1 - x^2}} right ) = 2 sqrt{1 - x^2} - frac{2x^2}{sqrt{1 - x^2}}]Combine the terms:[g'(x) = frac{2 (1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{sqrt{1 - x^2}} = frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2x^2}{sqrt{1 - x^2}} = frac{2 - 4x^2}{sqrt{1 - x^2}}]Now, compute (h'(x)):[h'(x) = 4x]Now, applying the quotient rule:[f'(x) = frac{g'(x) h(x) - g(x) h'(x)}{[h(x)]^2}]Substitute (g'(x)), (h(x)), (g(x)), and (h'(x)):[f'(x) = frac{left( frac{2 - 4x^2}{sqrt{1 - x^2}} right)(1 + 2x^2) - (2x sqrt{1 - x^2})(4x)}{(1 + 2x^2)^2}]Let me compute the numerator step by step.First term: (left( frac{2 - 4x^2}{sqrt{1 - x^2}} right)(1 + 2x^2))Multiply numerator and denominator:[frac{(2 - 4x^2)(1 + 2x^2)}{sqrt{1 - x^2}}]Let me expand the numerator:[(2 - 4x^2)(1 + 2x^2) = 2(1 + 2x^2) - 4x^2(1 + 2x^2) = 2 + 4x^2 - 4x^2 - 8x^4 = 2 - 8x^4]So, the first term becomes:[frac{2 - 8x^4}{sqrt{1 - x^2}}]Second term: (- (2x sqrt{1 - x^2})(4x))Simplify:[-8x^2 sqrt{1 - x^2}]So, putting it all together, the numerator is:[frac{2 - 8x^4}{sqrt{1 - x^2}} - 8x^2 sqrt{1 - x^2}]To combine these terms, let me write both with the same denominator:First term: (frac{2 - 8x^4}{sqrt{1 - x^2}})Second term: (-8x^2 (1 - x^2)^{1/2} = -8x^2 sqrt{1 - x^2})So, let me factor out (frac{1}{sqrt{1 - x^2}}):[frac{2 - 8x^4 - 8x^2 (1 - x^2)}{sqrt{1 - x^2}}]Compute the numerator inside the brackets:[2 - 8x^4 - 8x^2 + 8x^4 = 2 - 8x^2]So, the numerator becomes:[frac{2 - 8x^2}{sqrt{1 - x^2}}]Therefore, the derivative (f'(x)) is:[f'(x) = frac{frac{2 - 8x^2}{sqrt{1 - x^2}}}{(1 + 2x^2)^2} = frac{2 - 8x^2}{sqrt{1 - x^2} (1 + 2x^2)^2}]To find critical points, set (f'(x) = 0):[2 - 8x^2 = 0]Solving for (x):[8x^2 = 2 implies x^2 = frac{1}{4} implies x = frac{1}{2}]Since (x in (0, 1)), (x = frac{1}{2}) is the critical point.Now, we need to check whether this critical point gives a maximum. Let me test the sign of (f'(x)) around (x = frac{1}{2}).For (x < frac{1}{2}), say (x = frac{1}{4}):[2 - 8x^2 = 2 - 8 cdot frac{1}{16} = 2 - frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2} > 0]So, (f'(x) > 0) for (x < frac{1}{2}).For (x > frac{1}{2}), say (x = frac{3}{4}):[2 - 8x^2 = 2 - 8 cdot frac{9}{16} = 2 - frac{9}{2} = -frac{5}{2} < 0]So, (f'(x) < 0) for (x > frac{1}{2}).Therefore, (f(x)) increases on ((0, frac{1}{2})) and decreases on ((frac{1}{2}, 1)), so (x = frac{1}{2}) is indeed the point of maximum.Now, let's compute (fleft(frac{1}{2}right)):First, compute (sqrt{1 - x^2}):[sqrt{1 - left(frac{1}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{1}{4}} = sqrt{frac{3}{4}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]Then, compute the numerator:[2x sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2 cdot frac{1}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]Compute the denominator:[1 + 2x^2 = 1 + 2 cdot frac{1}{4} = 1 + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}]So, (fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{sqrt{3}/2}{3/2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3})Therefore, the maximum value of (tan beta) is (frac{sqrt{3}}{3}).Wait, but let me double-check this result because sometimes when dealing with trigonometric functions, especially with substitutions, it's easy to make a mistake.So, if (x = frac{1}{2}), then (sin alpha = frac{1}{2}), which implies (alpha = frac{pi}{6}). Then, let's compute (beta).From the original equation:[sin beta = 2 cos(alpha + beta) sin alpha]Given (alpha = frac{pi}{6}), so (sin alpha = frac{1}{2}), so:[sin beta = 2 cosleft(frac{pi}{6} + betaright) cdot frac{1}{2} = cosleft(frac{pi}{6} + betaright)]So, we have:[sin beta = cosleft(frac{pi}{6} + betaright)]Using the identity (cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B), so:[sin beta = cos frac{pi}{6} cos beta - sin frac{pi}{6} sin beta]Compute the values:[cos frac{pi}{6} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, quad sin frac{pi}{6} = frac{1}{2}]So, substituting:[sin beta = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos beta - frac{1}{2} sin beta]Bring all terms to the left side:[sin beta + frac{1}{2} sin beta - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos beta = 0]Combine like terms:[frac{3}{2} sin beta - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos beta = 0]Multiply both sides by 2:[3 sin beta - sqrt{3} cos beta = 0]Bring one term to the other side:[3 sin beta = sqrt{3} cos beta]Divide both sides by (cos beta):[3 tan beta = sqrt{3}]So,[tan beta = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}]Which is consistent with our earlier result. So, that seems correct.Therefore, the maximum value of (tan beta) is indeed (frac{sqrt{3}}{3}).But just to be thorough, let me check the endpoints. As (x) approaches 0, (tan beta) approaches 0. As (x) approaches 1, let's see what happens.Compute (lim_{x to 1^-} f(x)):[lim_{x to 1^-} frac{2x sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 + 2x^2}]As (x) approaches 1, the numerator approaches 0 (since (sqrt{1 - x^2}) approaches 0), and the denominator approaches 3. So, the limit is 0.Therefore, the maximum occurs at (x = frac{1}{2}), giving (tan beta = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}).So, I think that's the correct answer.**Final Answer**The maximum value of (tan beta) is (boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}})."},{"question":"A positive integer divisor of 12! is chosen at random.

The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. The options are given, so that might help if I get stuck, but I should try to solve it step by step.First, I remember that to find the number of divisors of a number, I need its prime factorization. So, let me start by finding the prime factors of 12!.12! means 12 factorial, which is 12 × 11 × 10 × ... × 1. To find its prime factors, I can break down each number from 1 to 12 into primes and multiply them together.Let me list the primes up to 12: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.Now, let's find the exponents for each prime in 12!.Starting with 2:- 2 appears in 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.But to find the exponent, I need to count how many times 2 appears in each of these numbers.- 2: contributes one 2- 4 = 2²: contributes two 2s- 6 = 2×3: contributes one 2- 8 = 2³: contributes three 2s- 10 = 2×5: contributes one 2- 12 = 2²×3: contributes two 2sAdding them up: 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 10. So exponent of 2 is 10.Next, 3:- 3 appears in 3, 6, 9, 12.Counting the exponents:- 3: one 3- 6 = 2×3: one 3- 9 = 3²: two 3s- 12 = 2²×3: one 3Adding them: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. So exponent of 3 is 5.Next, 5:- 5 appears in 5 and 10.Counting:- 5: one 5- 10 = 2×5: one 5Total: 1 + 1 = 2. Exponent of 5 is 2.Next, 7:- 7 appears in 7 and 14, but 14 is beyond 12, so only in 7.So exponent of 7 is 1.Similarly, 11:- 11 appears only in 11.So exponent of 11 is 1.So, putting it all together, 12! = 2¹⁰ × 3⁵ × 5² × 7¹ × 11¹.Okay, so the prime factorization is done. Now, to find the number of positive integer divisors of 12!, I can use the formula that if a number N = p₁^a × p₂^b × ... × pₙ^k, then the number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1).So, applying that here:Number of divisors = (10 + 1)(5 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 11 × 6 × 3 × 2 × 2.Let me compute that step by step:11 × 6 = 6666 × 3 = 198198 × 2 = 396396 × 2 = 792.So, 12! has 792 positive divisors.Now, I need to find how many of these divisors are perfect squares. Then, the probability will be (number of square divisors)/792.To find the number of square divisors, I remember that a perfect square has even exponents in its prime factorization. So, for each prime, the exponent in the divisor must be even and less than or equal to the exponent in 12!.So, let's consider each prime:For 2: exponent in 12! is 10. So, possible exponents in a square divisor are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. That's 6 choices.For 3: exponent in 12! is 5. So, possible exponents in a square divisor are 0, 2, 4. That's 3 choices.For 5: exponent in 12! is 2. So, possible exponents in a square divisor are 0, 2. That's 2 choices.For 7: exponent in 12! is 1. So, possible exponents in a square divisor are 0. Because 1 is odd, and we can't have 2 as it's more than 1. So, only 1 choice.Similarly, for 11: exponent in 12! is 1. So, same as 7, only 0 is possible. So, 1 choice.Therefore, the number of square divisors is 6 × 3 × 2 × 1 × 1.Calculating that:6 × 3 = 1818 × 2 = 3636 × 1 = 3636 × 1 = 36.So, there are 36 square divisors.Therefore, the probability is 36 / 792.Now, I need to simplify this fraction.First, let's see if both numerator and denominator are divisible by 12.36 ÷ 12 = 3792 ÷ 12 = 66So, 36/792 = 3/66.Wait, 3 and 66 are both divisible by 3.3 ÷ 3 = 166 ÷ 3 = 22So, 3/66 simplifies to 1/22.Wait, so 36/792 = 1/22.But let me check that again because 36 divided by 792: 792 ÷ 36 is 22, yes. So, 36/792 = 1/22.Wait, but 1/22 is in simplest terms because 1 and 22 share no common divisors other than 1.So, m = 1, n = 22. Therefore, m + n = 23.Looking at the options, E is 23. So, the answer should be E.Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 23 is an option, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, prime factorization of 12!:2^10 × 3^5 × 5^2 × 7^1 × 11^1. That seems correct.Number of divisors: (10+1)(5+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 11×6×3×2×2.11×6 is 66, 66×3 is 198, 198×2 is 396, 396×2 is 792. Correct.Number of square divisors: for each prime, exponents must be even and ≤ exponent in 12!.For 2: exponents 0,2,4,6,8,10: 6 choices.For 3: exponents 0,2,4: 3 choices.For 5: exponents 0,2: 2 choices.For 7: exponent 0: 1 choice.For 11: exponent 0: 1 choice.So, 6×3×2×1×1 = 36. Correct.Probability: 36/792. Simplify:Divide numerator and denominator by 36: 36 ÷36=1, 792 ÷36=22. So, 1/22. So, m=1, n=22, m +n=23.Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 23, which is option E.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"Given real numbers ageqslant 0, bgeqslant 0, and a+b=4, let w=a^{2}+ab+b^{2}. Let w_{1} and w_{2} be the maximum and minimum values of the algebraic expression w, respectively. Find the value of w_{1}-w_{2}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given two non-negative real numbers, a and b, such that their sum is 4. I need to find the maximum and minimum values of the expression w, which is defined as a² + ab + b². Then, I have to find the difference between these two values, w₁ - w₂.First, let me write down what I know:- a and b are both greater than or equal to 0.- a + b = 4.- w = a² + ab + b².I need to find the maximum and minimum of w given these constraints.Hmm, maybe I can express w in terms of a single variable since a + b = 4. That way, I can turn this into a single-variable optimization problem, which might be easier to handle.Let me solve for b in terms of a. Since a + b = 4, then b = 4 - a.Substituting this into w:w = a² + a*(4 - a) + (4 - a)².Let me expand this step by step.First, expand a*(4 - a):a*(4 - a) = 4a - a².Next, expand (4 - a)²:(4 - a)² = 16 - 8a + a².Now, substitute these back into w:w = a² + (4a - a²) + (16 - 8a + a²).Let me combine like terms:- a² terms: a² - a² + a² = a².- a terms: 4a - 8a = -4a.- constants: 16.So, putting it all together:w = a² - 4a + 16.Wait, let me double-check that:Starting with w = a² + (4a - a²) + (16 - 8a + a²).So, a² + 4a - a² + 16 - 8a + a².Combine a² terms: a² - a² + a² = a².Combine a terms: 4a - 8a = -4a.Constants: 16.Yes, that seems correct. So, w = a² - 4a + 16.Now, this is a quadratic in terms of a. Since a is a real number between 0 and 4 (because a and b are non-negative and sum to 4), I can analyze this quadratic on the interval [0, 4].Quadratic functions have their extrema either at the vertex or at the endpoints of the interval. So, to find the maximum and minimum of w, I can check the value of w at a = 0, a = 4, and at the vertex of the parabola.First, let me find the vertex. The general form of a quadratic is f(a) = pa² + qa + r. The vertex occurs at a = -q/(2p).In this case, p = 1, q = -4. So, the vertex is at a = -(-4)/(2*1) = 4/2 = 2.So, the vertex is at a = 2. Let me compute w at a = 2.w(2) = (2)² - 4*(2) + 16 = 4 - 8 + 16 = 12.Now, let's compute w at the endpoints.At a = 0:w(0) = 0² - 4*0 + 16 = 0 - 0 + 16 = 16.At a = 4:w(4) = (4)² - 4*(4) + 16 = 16 - 16 + 16 = 16.So, interesting. At both endpoints, a = 0 and a = 4, w is 16. At the vertex, a = 2, w is 12.Therefore, the minimum value of w is 12, and the maximum value is 16.Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Because sometimes, depending on the direction the parabola opens, the vertex could be a maximum or a minimum.In this case, the coefficient of a² is positive (1), so the parabola opens upwards. That means the vertex is a minimum point. So, the minimum value is 12, and the maximum occurs at the endpoints, which are both 16.Therefore, w₁, the maximum, is 16, and w₂, the minimum, is 12. So, the difference w₁ - w₂ is 16 - 12 = 4.Wait, but just to make sure, let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached? Maybe using calculus or another algebraic method?Alternatively, I could use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overkill for this problem. Or perhaps, since it's symmetric in a and b, I can consider cases where a = b or something like that.Wait, when a = b, since a + b = 4, then a = b = 2. So, plugging into w: 2² + 2*2 + 2² = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. That's consistent with the vertex value.Alternatively, when one variable is 0, say a = 0, then b = 4, so w = 0 + 0 + 16 = 16. Similarly, when b = 0, a = 4, same result.So, that seems consistent. So, the maximum is 16, the minimum is 12, difference is 4.Alternatively, another algebraic approach: note that w = a² + ab + b² can be rewritten using the identity:a² + ab + b² = (a + b)² - ab.Since a + b = 4, then (a + b)² = 16. So, w = 16 - ab.Therefore, w = 16 - ab.So, to maximize w, we need to minimize ab, and to minimize w, we need to maximize ab.So, now, the problem reduces to finding the maximum and minimum of ab given that a + b = 4 and a, b ≥ 0.This is a standard optimization problem. The product ab is maximized when a = b, which is 2*2 = 4. So, maximum ab is 4, minimum ab is 0 (when either a or b is 0).Therefore, substituting back into w:- When ab is maximum (4), w is 16 - 4 = 12.- When ab is minimum (0), w is 16 - 0 = 16.Hence, w₁ = 16, w₂ = 12, so w₁ - w₂ = 4.So, that's another way to see it. Either way, the difference is 4.Wait, just to make sure, let me think if there's any other critical point or something I might have missed.But since in both methods, whether expressing w in terms of a single variable and finding the vertex, or using the identity to express w in terms of ab, the results are consistent.Therefore, I can be confident that the difference is 4.**Final Answer**The value of ( w_{1} - w_{2} ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"John has a raw squat of 600 pounds without sleeves or wraps.  Sleeves add 30 pounds to his lift.  Wraps add 25% to his squat.  How much more pounds does he get out of wraps versus sleeves.","answer":"First, I need to determine how much weight John can lift with sleeves and with wraps.With sleeves, the additional weight is straightforward: 30 pounds added to his raw squat of 600 pounds, resulting in a total of 630 pounds.For wraps, the additional weight is 25% of his raw squat. Calculating 25% of 600 pounds gives 150 pounds. Adding this to his raw squat results in a total of 750 pounds.Finally, to find out how much more weight wraps provide compared to sleeves, I subtract the total with sleeves from the total with wraps: 750 pounds minus 630 pounds equals 120 pounds."},{"question":"In how many ways can 8 people be arranged in a line if Alice and Bob must be next to each other, and Carol must be somewhere behind Dan?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: I need to figure out how many ways 8 people can be arranged in a line with two conditions. First, Alice and Bob must be next to each other. Second, Carol must be somewhere behind Dan. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, let me think about the total number of ways to arrange 8 people without any restrictions. That would be 8 factorial, which is 8! = 40320. But of course, we have some constraints here, so the actual number will be less than that.The first condition is that Alice and Bob must be next to each other. I remember that when two people must be together, we can treat them as a single unit or \\"block.\\" So instead of thinking of them as two separate people, we can think of them as one \\"double person.\\" That means instead of 8 individuals, we have 7 units to arrange. The number of ways to arrange these 7 units is 7!.But wait, within this block, Alice and Bob can switch places. So for each arrangement of the 7 units, there are 2 possible arrangements of Alice and Bob within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements where Alice and Bob are next to each other is 7! * 2. Let me calculate that: 7! is 5040, so 5040 * 2 = 10080. So, 10,080 ways without considering the second condition.Now, onto the second condition: Carol must be somewhere behind Dan. Hmm, okay. So in the entire line, wherever Carol is, Dan must be somewhere in front of her. I think this is a classic problem where we consider the relative positions of two people.In any arrangement of people, for any two distinct people, each is equally likely to be in front or behind the other. So, for Carol and Dan, the number of arrangements where Carol is behind Dan should be exactly half of the total number of arrangements where Alice and Bob are together. Is that right?Wait, let me think again. If we have a certain number of arrangements where Alice and Bob are together, then in half of those, Carol will be behind Dan, and in the other half, Carol will be in front of Dan. So, yes, if we have 10,080 total arrangements with Alice and Bob together, then half of them will satisfy Carol being behind Dan. So, 10,080 divided by 2 is 5040.But hold on, is that accurate? Let me make sure. Suppose we fix Alice and Bob as a block. Then, among the remaining 6 people, Carol and Dan are two of them. So, in the entire arrangement, the positions of Carol and Dan are independent of the Alice-Bob block. So, for each arrangement where Alice and Bob are together, the probability that Carol is behind Dan is 1/2, because for any two distinct positions, each has an equal chance of being in front or behind.Therefore, the total number of arrangements where Alice and Bob are together and Carol is behind Dan is indeed half of 10,080, which is 5040.Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering Carol and Dan's positions relative to each other first, and then considering Alice and Bob.Alternatively, we can think of the problem as two separate constraints: Alice and Bob must be adjacent, and Carol must be behind Dan. Since these are independent constraints, we can calculate the total number by considering both.But actually, no, they might not be entirely independent because the arrangement of Alice and Bob affects the positions of Carol and Dan. Hmm, maybe not. Let me see.If we first consider the Alice-Bob block, then we have 7 units. Among these 7 units, we have the Alice-Bob block, Carol, Dan, and the other 4 people. So, in these 7 units, the positions of Carol and Dan are independent of the Alice-Bob block. So, in terms of ordering, the number of ways where Carol is behind Dan is half of the total arrangements of these 7 units.But wait, the total arrangements of the 7 units is 7! * 2, as we calculated earlier. So, if we fix the Alice-Bob block, then within the 7 units, the number of ways where Carol is behind Dan is (7! * 2) / 2 = 7! = 5040. So that's consistent with our previous result.Alternatively, maybe we can model it as first treating Alice and Bob as a single entity, then considering the relative positions of Carol and Dan.So, let's think about it step by step:1. Treat Alice and Bob as a single block. So, we have 7 units: [Alice-Bob], Carol, Dan, and the other 4 people.2. Now, we need to arrange these 7 units in a line. The number of ways to arrange them is 7!.3. Within the Alice-Bob block, Alice and Bob can be in two different orders: Alice first or Bob first. So, multiply by 2.4. Now, among these arrangements, we need to consider the relative positions of Carol and Dan. For each arrangement, Carol can be either in front of Dan or behind Dan. Since all arrangements are equally likely, exactly half of them will have Carol behind Dan.Therefore, the total number is 7! * 2 * (1/2) = 7! = 5040.Wait, so that's consistent. So, whether we think of it as first arranging the 7 units and then considering the Carol-Dan order, or first considering the Carol-Dan order and then arranging the rest, we end up with the same result.Alternatively, another approach: Let's consider all possible arrangements where Alice and Bob are together, which is 2 * 7! = 10080. Then, in these arrangements, the number of arrangements where Carol is behind Dan is exactly half, so 10080 / 2 = 5040.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as fixing the positions of Carol and Dan. Let's see.Suppose I first choose positions for Carol and Dan such that Carol is behind Dan. Then, arrange the rest, including Alice and Bob.But that might complicate things because we have two constraints: Alice and Bob must be adjacent, and Carol must be behind Dan.Alternatively, maybe we can model it as:First, choose positions for Alice and Bob as a block. Then, choose positions for Carol and Dan such that Carol is behind Dan, and then arrange the rest.But that might be more complicated.Wait, let's try that approach.1. First, treat Alice and Bob as a block. So, we have 7 units.2. Now, we need to place this block somewhere in the line. The number of ways to place the block is 7 positions (since it's a block of 2, in 8 spots, it can start at position 1 through 7).Wait, no, actually, if we consider the 7 units, each unit is a single person or the Alice-Bob block. So, the number of ways to arrange the 7 units is 7!.But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.Wait, another way: Let's think of the problem as two separate constraints and see if we can combine them.First, the number of ways where Alice and Bob are next to each other is 2 * 7!.Second, the number of ways where Carol is behind Dan is half of the total arrangements, which is 8! / 2.But since these are overlapping constraints, we can't just multiply them. Instead, we need to find the number of arrangements where both conditions are satisfied.So, perhaps the correct way is to first fix Alice and Bob as a block, which gives us 7 units, and then in those 7 units, the number of arrangements where Carol is behind Dan is half of 7!.Therefore, total arrangements would be 2 * (7! / 2) = 7!.Wait, that's 5040, same as before.Alternatively, maybe we can think of it as:Total arrangements with Alice and Bob together: 2 * 7!.In these arrangements, the number where Carol is behind Dan is half, so 2 * 7! / 2 = 7!.So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, another approach: Let's think about the positions of Carol and Dan relative to the Alice-Bob block.Suppose we fix the Alice-Bob block somewhere in the line. Then, among the remaining 6 people, Carol and Dan are two of them. The number of ways to arrange the remaining 6 people is 6!.In these 6!, the number of arrangements where Carol is behind Dan is 6! / 2.Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 2 (for Alice-Bob order) * (number of ways to place the Alice-Bob block) * (number of ways to arrange the rest with Carol behind Dan).Wait, but how many ways are there to place the Alice-Bob block?Wait, actually, when we treat Alice and Bob as a block, we have 7 units. The number of ways to arrange these 7 units is 7!.But if we fix the Alice-Bob block in a specific position, then the number of ways to arrange the rest is 6!.But perhaps this is complicating things.Wait, maybe I should think of it as:Total number of arrangements where Alice and Bob are together: 2 * 7!.In these arrangements, the number of arrangements where Carol is behind Dan is half, so 2 * 7! / 2 = 7!.So, 7! = 5040.Alternatively, let me think of it as:First, arrange all 8 people without any constraints: 8!.Then, the probability that Alice and Bob are next to each other is (2 * 7!) / 8! = 2 / 8 = 1/4.Similarly, the probability that Carol is behind Dan is 1/2.Since these are independent events, the combined probability is 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8.Therefore, the number of arrangements is 8! * 1/8 = 40320 / 8 = 5040.Wait, that's another way to get the same answer. So, that seems to confirm it.But wait, are these events independent? Hmm, actually, no, because arranging Alice and Bob affects the positions of Carol and Dan. So, are they independent?Wait, maybe not entirely, but in this case, since the constraints are on different pairs, perhaps the probabilities multiply.Wait, let me think. The probability that Alice and Bob are next to each other is 2/8 = 1/4, as calculated.Given that Alice and Bob are next to each other, the probability that Carol is behind Dan is 1/2, because in the remaining 6 people, Carol and Dan are just two people, and their relative order is equally likely to be either way.Therefore, the combined probability is 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8.Therefore, the number of arrangements is 8! * 1/8 = 5040.So, that's consistent with the previous methods.Therefore, regardless of the approach, the answer seems to be 5040.Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in assuming independence.Is the event that Alice and Bob are next to each other independent of the event that Carol is behind Dan?Hmm, actually, no, because if Alice and Bob are next to each other, that affects the total number of available positions for Carol and Dan. However, in the previous calculations, when we fixed Alice and Bob as a block, the relative positions of Carol and Dan among the remaining 6 people are still equally likely, so the probability remains 1/2.Therefore, the combined probability is indeed 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8, leading to 5040 arrangements.Alternatively, another way to think about it is:First, consider all possible arrangements where Alice and Bob are next to each other: 2 * 7! = 10080.Now, in these arrangements, how many have Carol behind Dan?Since in any arrangement, the probability that Carol is behind Dan is 1/2, the number is 10080 / 2 = 5040.So, same result.Therefore, I think it's safe to conclude that the number of ways is 5040.Wait, just to make sure, let me think of a smaller case.Suppose we have 4 people: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dan.How many arrangements where Alice and Bob are next to each other, and Carol is behind Dan.Let me list them.First, treat Alice and Bob as a block: [AB] or [BA].So, the blocks are [AB], C, D or [BA], C, D.We have 3 units, so 3! = 6 arrangements for each block.So, total 12 arrangements.Now, in these 12 arrangements, how many have Carol behind Dan.In each arrangement of the 3 units, the relative order of C and D can be CD or DC.So, for each block, half of the arrangements will have C behind D.So, for [AB], the number of arrangements where C is behind D is 3! / 2 = 3.Similarly, for [BA], it's also 3.So, total 6 arrangements.Alternatively, total arrangements with Alice and Bob together: 12.Number with Carol behind Dan: 6.Which is 12 / 2 = 6.So, in this smaller case, it's correct.Similarly, in the original problem, with 8 people, the number is 7! = 5040.Therefore, I think the answer is 5040.**Final Answer**The number of ways is boxed{5040}."},{"question":"If the solution of the system of equations left{begin{array}{l}2x+3y=4 3x+2y=2m-3end{array}right. satisfies x+y=frac{1}{5}, then m=______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this system of equations:2x + 3y = 43x + 2y = 2m - 3And I know that the solution (x, y) satisfies x + y = 1/5. I need to find the value of m.Hmm, let's see. I think the best way to approach this is to solve the system of equations for x and y, and then use the condition x + y = 1/5 to find m. That makes sense because m is part of the second equation, so once I know x and y, I can plug them into the second equation to solve for m.First, let me write down the equations again:1) 2x + 3y = 42) 3x + 2y = 2m - 3And we also know that:3) x + y = 1/5So, actually, equation 3 is another equation that relates x and y. Maybe I can use this to substitute into equations 1 and 2.Wait, but equations 1 and 2 are already a system, so maybe I can solve them first and then use equation 3 to find m. Let me try that.Let me solve equations 1 and 2 for x and y. I can use either substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination because the coefficients are small.Looking at equations 1 and 2:Equation 1: 2x + 3y = 4Equation 2: 3x + 2y = 2m - 3If I multiply equation 1 by 3 and equation 2 by 2, the coefficients of x will be 6 and 6, which can then be subtracted to eliminate x.So, multiplying equation 1 by 3:3*(2x + 3y) = 3*4Which gives:6x + 9y = 12Multiplying equation 2 by 2:2*(3x + 2y) = 2*(2m - 3)Which gives:6x + 4y = 4m - 6Now, subtract the second new equation from the first new equation:(6x + 9y) - (6x + 4y) = 12 - (4m - 6)Simplify:6x + 9y - 6x - 4y = 12 - 4m + 6This simplifies to:5y = 18 - 4mSo, 5y = 18 - 4mTherefore, y = (18 - 4m)/5Okay, so that's y in terms of m. Now, let's find x.We can use equation 3, which is x + y = 1/5.So, x = 1/5 - ySubstituting y from above:x = 1/5 - (18 - 4m)/5Let me compute that:x = (1 - (18 - 4m))/5Simplify numerator:1 - 18 + 4m = -17 + 4mSo, x = (-17 + 4m)/5Okay, so now I have expressions for both x and y in terms of m.x = (4m - 17)/5y = (18 - 4m)/5Now, let's plug these back into one of the original equations to solve for m. Let's pick equation 1: 2x + 3y = 4.Substituting x and y:2*(4m - 17)/5 + 3*(18 - 4m)/5 = 4Let me compute each term:First term: 2*(4m - 17)/5 = (8m - 34)/5Second term: 3*(18 - 4m)/5 = (54 - 12m)/5Adding them together:(8m - 34 + 54 - 12m)/5 = 4Combine like terms in the numerator:8m - 12m = -4m-34 + 54 = 20So, (-4m + 20)/5 = 4Multiply both sides by 5:-4m + 20 = 20Subtract 20 from both sides:-4m = 0Divide both sides by -4:m = 0Wait, so m is 0? Let me check that.If m is 0, then the second equation becomes:3x + 2y = 2*0 - 3 = -3So, 3x + 2y = -3And the first equation is 2x + 3y = 4Let me solve this system with m=0.We can use substitution or elimination again.From equation 3, x + y = 1/5, so x = 1/5 - yPlug into equation 1:2*(1/5 - y) + 3y = 4Compute:2/5 - 2y + 3y = 4Simplify:2/5 + y = 4So, y = 4 - 2/5 = 20/5 - 2/5 = 18/5Then x = 1/5 - y = 1/5 - 18/5 = -17/5So, x = -17/5 and y = 18/5Now, plug into equation 2: 3x + 2y = -3Compute 3*(-17/5) + 2*(18/5) = (-51/5) + (36/5) = (-51 + 36)/5 = (-15)/5 = -3Which matches the right-hand side. So, yes, m=0 is correct.Alternatively, let me check using the expressions for x and y in terms of m.We had x = (4m -17)/5 and y = (18 -4m)/5If m=0, then x = (-17)/5 and y = 18/5, which is consistent with above.So, m=0 is indeed the correct answer.Wait, but let me think again. When I solved for y earlier, I had y = (18 -4m)/5, and x = (4m -17)/5. Then I plugged into equation 1 and found m=0.But just to make sure, let me try plugging into equation 2 as well.Equation 2: 3x + 2y = 2m - 3Using x = (4m -17)/5 and y = (18 -4m)/5Compute 3x + 2y:3*(4m -17)/5 + 2*(18 -4m)/5= (12m -51)/5 + (36 -8m)/5= (12m -51 + 36 -8m)/5= (4m -15)/5Set equal to 2m -3:(4m -15)/5 = 2m -3Multiply both sides by 5:4m -15 = 10m -15Subtract 4m from both sides:-15 = 6m -15Add 15 to both sides:0 = 6mSo, m=0Same result. So, that's consistent.Therefore, m=0 is correct.I think that's solid. So, the answer is m=0.**Final Answer**The value of ( m ) is boxed{0}."},{"question":"The volume of substance A is half the sum of the volumes of substances B and C, and the volume of substance B is frac{1}{5} of the sum of the volumes of substances A and C. Find the ratio of the volume of substance C to the sum of the volumes of substances A and B.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about the volumes of three substances, A, B, and C. I need to find the ratio of the volume of substance C to the sum of the volumes of substances A and B. Hmm, let me try to parse the problem step by step.First, the problem says: \\"The volume of substance A is half the sum of the volumes of substances B and C.\\" Let me write that down as an equation. If I let the volumes be A, B, and C, then:A = (1/2)(B + C)Okay, that seems straightforward. So A is half of the sum of B and C.Next, it says: \\"The volume of substance B is 1/5 of the sum of the volumes of substances A and C.\\" So similarly, I can write that as:B = (1/5)(A + C)Alright, so now I have two equations:1. A = (1/2)(B + C)2. B = (1/5)(A + C)I need to find the ratio C / (A + B). So, I think I need to express A and B in terms of C or find a relationship between A, B, and C so that I can find this ratio.Let me see. Maybe I can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let's rewrite the equations to make it easier.From equation 1:A = (B + C)/2Multiply both sides by 2:2A = B + CSo, equation 1 becomes:2A - B - C = 0From equation 2:B = (A + C)/5Multiply both sides by 5:5B = A + CSo, equation 2 becomes:A - 5B + C = 0Now, I have a system of two equations:1. 2A - B - C = 02. A - 5B + C = 0Hmm, maybe I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination.If I add the two equations together, let's see:(2A - B - C) + (A - 5B + C) = 0 + 0Simplify:2A + A - B - 5B - C + C = 0Which is:3A - 6B = 0Simplify further by dividing both sides by 3:A - 2B = 0So, A = 2BOkay, that's helpful. So A is twice as big as B.Now, let's substitute A = 2B into one of the original equations to find C in terms of B.Let's use equation 2:A - 5B + C = 0Substitute A = 2B:2B - 5B + C = 0Simplify:-3B + C = 0So, C = 3BAlright, so now we have A = 2B and C = 3B.So, all volumes can be expressed in terms of B. That should make it easier to find the ratio.So, let's write A, B, and C in terms of B:A = 2BB = BC = 3BSo, now, the ratio we need is C / (A + B). Let's compute that.First, compute A + B:A + B = 2B + B = 3BThen, C is 3B.So, the ratio is:C / (A + B) = 3B / 3B = 1Wait, that's 1? So the ratio is 1, which is 1:1? That seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the two equations:1. 2A = B + C2. 5B = A + CThen, I expressed A = 2B and substituted into equation 2:5B = 2B + C => 5B - 2B = C => 3B = CSo, yes, C = 3B. Then, A = 2B.So, A + B = 2B + B = 3B, and C = 3B. So, C / (A + B) = 3B / 3B = 1.Hmm, so the ratio is 1, which is 1:1. So, the volume of substance C is equal to the sum of the volumes of substances A and B.Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because if C is equal to A + B, then when you take the ratio C / (A + B), it's 1. But let me just verify with the original equations.If A = 2B and C = 3B, let's plug these into the original statements.First statement: A is half the sum of B and C.A = (B + C)/2Plugging in A = 2B and C = 3B:2B = (B + 3B)/2 = (4B)/2 = 2BYes, that works.Second statement: B is 1/5 of the sum of A and C.B = (A + C)/5Plugging in A = 2B and C = 3B:B = (2B + 3B)/5 = (5B)/5 = BThat also works.So, both equations are satisfied. Therefore, my calculations are correct.Therefore, the ratio of the volume of substance C to the sum of the volumes of substances A and B is 1, or 1:1.Wait, but the problem says \\"the ratio of the volume of substance C to the sum of the volumes of substances A and B.\\" So, in terms of ratio, it's 1:1, which can also be written as 1.But ratios are often expressed in the form of numbers separated by a colon, so 1:1.But sometimes, depending on the context, it might be expressed as a fraction, which is 1/1, but that's just 1.So, I think the answer is 1, or 1:1.But let me just think again: If C is equal to A + B, then C is as big as A + B, so their ratio is 1. That makes sense.Alternatively, if I think in terms of variables, if I let B = 1, then A = 2, and C = 3. So, A + B = 3, and C = 3. So, 3/3 = 1.Yes, that seems consistent.Therefore, I think the ratio is 1:1.**Final Answer**The ratio of the volume of substance ( C ) to the sum of the volumes of substances ( A ) and ( B ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Calculate the value of the polynomial f(x) = 5x^5 + 4x^4 + 3x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 1 at x=3 using Horner's Rule.","answer":"Okay, so I need to calculate the value of the polynomial ( f(x) = 5x^5 + 4x^4 + 3x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 1 ) at ( x = 3 ) using Horner's Rule. Hmm, I remember Horner's Rule is a method to evaluate polynomials more efficiently, especially when dealing with higher degrees. It helps reduce the number of multiplications needed, right? Let me try to recall how it works.From what I remember, Horner's Rule involves rewriting the polynomial in a nested form. For example, a polynomial like ( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d ) can be rewritten as ( ((ax + b)x + c)x + d ). This way, you can evaluate it step by step, which is more efficient because it reduces the number of operations. Instead of calculating each term separately and then adding them up, which would require more multiplications, Horner's method uses a step-by-step approach.So, applying that to the given polynomial ( f(x) = 5x^5 + 4x^4 + 3x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 1 ), I need to express it in a nested form. Let me write down the coefficients first: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1. Wait, is that right? Let me check:- The coefficient of ( x^5 ) is 5.- The coefficient of ( x^4 ) is 4.- The coefficient of ( x^3 ) is 3.- The coefficient of ( x^2 ) is 2.- The coefficient of ( x ) is 1.- The constant term is 1.Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficients are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1. Now, to apply Horner's Rule, I think we start from the highest degree and work our way down, multiplying by x each time and adding the next coefficient.Let me try to structure this step by step. So, starting with the highest degree term, which is 5x^5. Then, we add the next term, 4x^4, but in Horner's form, it's like (5x + 4)x^4. Wait, maybe I should think of it as nesting each term inside the previous one. Let me write it out:Start with 5.Multiply by x: 5x.Add the next coefficient, 4: 5x + 4.Multiply by x: (5x + 4)x.Add the next coefficient, 3: (5x + 4)x + 3.Multiply by x: ((5x + 4)x + 3)x.Add the next coefficient, 2: ((5x + 4)x + 3)x + 2.Multiply by x: (((5x + 4)x + 3)x + 2)x.Add the next coefficient, 1: (((5x + 4)x + 3)x + 2)x + 1.Multiply by x: ((((5x + 4)x + 3)x + 2)x + 1)x.Add the last coefficient, 1: ((((5x + 4)x + 3)x + 2)x + 1)x + 1.Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should write it in a tabular form or step-by-step calculations. Let me try that.So, for Horner's method, starting from the highest coefficient, we bring down the 5. Then, multiply by x (which is 3 in this case) and add the next coefficient. Let me write this as a process:1. Start with the leading coefficient: 5.2. Multiply by x: 5 * 3 = 15.3. Add the next coefficient: 15 + 4 = 19.4. Multiply by x: 19 * 3 = 57.5. Add the next coefficient: 57 + 3 = 60.6. Multiply by x: 60 * 3 = 180.7. Add the next coefficient: 180 + 2 = 182.8. Multiply by x: 182 * 3 = 546.9. Add the next coefficient: 546 + 1 = 547.10. Multiply by x: 547 * 3 = 1641.11. Add the last coefficient: 1641 + 1 = 1642.Wait, hold on. Let me verify that. So, starting with 5, multiply by 3, add 4, multiply by 3, add 3, multiply by 3, add 2, multiply by 3, add 1, multiply by 3, add 1. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me write it step by step:Step 1: 5Step 2: 5 * 3 = 15Step 3: 15 + 4 = 19Step 4: 19 * 3 = 57Step 5: 57 + 3 = 60Step 6: 60 * 3 = 180Step 7: 180 + 2 = 182Step 8: 182 * 3 = 546Step 9: 546 + 1 = 547Step 10: 547 * 3 = 1641Step 11: 1641 + 1 = 1642So, according to this, the value of the polynomial at x=3 is 1642. Let me check if that makes sense.Alternatively, maybe I should compute the polynomial directly without Horner's Rule to verify. Let's compute each term:( f(3) = 5*(3)^5 + 4*(3)^4 + 3*(3)^3 + 2*(3)^2 + 3 + 1 )Compute each term:- ( 3^5 = 243 ), so 5*243 = 1215- ( 3^4 = 81 ), so 4*81 = 324- ( 3^3 = 27 ), so 3*27 = 81- ( 3^2 = 9 ), so 2*9 = 18- The linear term is 3, so 1*3 = 3- The constant term is 1.Now, add all these up:1215 + 324 = 15391539 + 81 = 16201620 + 18 = 16381638 + 3 = 16411641 + 1 = 1642Okay, so that matches the result from Horner's Rule. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the value is 1642.But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the Horner's calculation. Let me go through each step again:Starting with 5.Multiply by 3: 5*3=15Add 4: 15+4=19Multiply by 3: 19*3=57Add 3: 57+3=60Multiply by 3: 60*3=180Add 2: 180+2=182Multiply by 3: 182*3=546Add 1: 546+1=547Multiply by 3: 547*3=1641Add 1: 1641+1=1642Yes, that's consistent. So, both methods give the same result, so I think 1642 is correct.Wait, just to make sure, let me recount the number of steps. The polynomial is degree 5, so there should be 5 multiplications and 5 additions, right? Let me see:Starting with 5 (no operation yet).1. Multiply by 3: 5*3=15 (1 multiplication)2. Add 4: 15+4=19 (1 addition)3. Multiply by 3: 19*3=57 (2 multiplications)4. Add 3: 57+3=60 (2 additions)5. Multiply by 3: 60*3=180 (3 multiplications)6. Add 2: 180+2=182 (3 additions)7. Multiply by 3: 182*3=546 (4 multiplications)8. Add 1: 546+1=547 (4 additions)9. Multiply by 3: 547*3=1641 (5 multiplications)10. Add 1: 1641+1=1642 (5 additions)Yes, so 5 multiplications and 5 additions, which is efficient compared to the direct method, which would require more operations.Alternatively, if I think about the number of operations in the direct method: for each term, you have to compute the power of x, then multiply by the coefficient, then add all together. So, for ( x^5 ), you compute ( x^5 ), which is 3^5=243, then multiply by 5, which is 1215. Similarly, for each term, you have to compute the power, multiply, then add. So, for each term, it's a multiplication and a power computation, which is more operations.Horner's method cleverly reuses the previous computations to minimize the number of operations, which is especially useful for higher-degree polynomials.So, in conclusion, using Horner's Rule, I evaluated the polynomial step by step, and the result is 1642. Both the direct method and Horner's Rule gave me the same result, so I feel confident that this is correct.**Final Answer**The value of the polynomial at ( x = 3 ) is boxed{1642}."},{"question":"Dani has 3 cats; Binkie, Frankie and Spaatz.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can combine them by multiplying their arguments. So, log₄(A) + log₄(B) = log₄(AB). That should simplify the equation a bit. Let me write that down:log₄[(x + 2y)(x - 2y)] = 1Okay, so that simplifies the left side. Now, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form to get rid of the logarithm. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that here:4^1 = (x + 2y)(x - 2y)Which simplifies to:4 = (x + 2y)(x - 2y)Hmm, that looks like a difference of squares. So, (x + 2y)(x - 2y) is equal to x² - (2y)², which is x² - 4y². So, substituting that in:4 = x² - 4y²Let me rearrange this equation to make it look more familiar:x² - 4y² = 4Dividing both sides by 4 to get it into standard form:(x²)/4 - y² = 1Oh, wait, that's the equation of a hyperbola. Specifically, it's a hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The standard form of a hyperbola is (x²)/a² - (y²)/b² = 1, so here, a² = 4 and b² = 1, which means a = 2 and b = 1.So, the equation represents a hyperbola with vertices at (±2, 0) and asymptotes y = ±(b/a)x = ±(1/2)x.Now, the problem asks for the minimum value of |x| - |y|. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the minimum of |x| - |y| given that (x, y) lies on this hyperbola.I think I should express |x| - |y| in terms of one variable and then find its minimum. But since the equation is in terms of x and y, maybe I can express y in terms of x or vice versa and substitute.Let me solve the hyperbola equation for y²:From x² - 4y² = 4,4y² = x² - 4,y² = (x² - 4)/4,y = ±√[(x² - 4)/4] = ±(√(x² - 4))/2So, y is expressed in terms of x. Since we're dealing with absolute values, |y| = (√(x² - 4))/2, because the square root is always non-negative.Similarly, |x| is just |x|, which is positive as well.So, |x| - |y| becomes |x| - (√(x² - 4))/2.But since the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes, I can consider x ≥ 0 without loss of generality because |x| will take care of the negative side. Similarly, since |y| is involved, the sign of y doesn't matter.So, let's assume x ≥ 0. Then, |x| = x, and |y| = (√(x² - 4))/2.Therefore, the expression becomes:f(x) = x - (√(x² - 4))/2Now, I need to find the minimum value of f(x). To do this, I can take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. That should give me the critical points, which could be minima or maxima.First, let's compute the derivative f'(x):f(x) = x - (1/2)√(x² - 4)So, f'(x) = d/dx [x] - (1/2) * d/dx [√(x² - 4)]The derivative of x is 1. For the second term, let's use the chain rule:d/dx [√(x² - 4)] = (1/(2√(x² - 4))) * d/dx [x² - 4] = (1/(2√(x² - 4))) * 2x = x / √(x² - 4)So, putting it all together:f'(x) = 1 - (1/2) * (x / √(x² - 4))Simplify:f'(x) = 1 - (x)/(2√(x² - 4))To find critical points, set f'(x) = 0:1 - (x)/(2√(x² - 4)) = 0Let me solve for x:1 = (x)/(2√(x² - 4))Multiply both sides by 2√(x² - 4):2√(x² - 4) = xNow, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:(2√(x² - 4))² = x²Which simplifies to:4(x² - 4) = x²4x² - 16 = x²Subtract x² from both sides:3x² - 16 = 0So,3x² = 16x² = 16/3x = ±4/√3But since we assumed x ≥ 0 earlier, we take the positive value:x = 4/√3Now, let's find the corresponding y value. From earlier, y² = (x² - 4)/4Plugging in x = 4/√3:y² = ((16/3) - 4)/4 = ((16/3) - (12/3))/4 = (4/3)/4 = 1/3So, y = ±1/√3But since we're dealing with |y|, it's 1/√3.Now, let's compute |x| - |y| at this point:|x| - |y| = (4/√3) - (1/√3) = (3/√3) = √3Wait, that's interesting. So, the value is √3. But is this a minimum?I should check the second derivative or analyze the behavior of f'(x) around x = 4/√3 to confirm if it's a minimum.Alternatively, since we're dealing with a hyperbola, and the function |x| - |y| is being minimized, it's possible that this critical point gives the minimum value.But let me just verify by plugging in a value slightly less than 4/√3 and slightly more to see if the function is indeed increasing after 4/√3 and decreasing before it, which would indicate a minimum.Let me choose x = 2, which is less than 4/√3 (since 4/√3 ≈ 2.309). Compute f'(2):f'(2) = 1 - (2)/(2√(4 - 4)) = 1 - (2)/(2*0). Wait, that's undefined because the denominator is zero. Hmm, that's because at x = 2, y = 0, which is the vertex of the hyperbola.Wait, maybe I should pick x = 3, which is greater than 4/√3.Compute f'(3):f'(3) = 1 - (3)/(2√(9 - 4)) = 1 - (3)/(2√5) ≈ 1 - (3)/(4.472) ≈ 1 - 0.670 ≈ 0.330, which is positive.So, when x > 4/√3, f'(x) is positive, meaning f(x) is increasing.Now, let's pick x = 2. Let's see, but at x = 2, y = 0, so |x| - |y| = 2 - 0 = 2. But wait, when x approaches 2 from the right, what happens?As x approaches 2 from the right, √(x² - 4) approaches 0, so f(x) = x - (√(x² - 4))/2 approaches x, which approaches 2. So, near x = 2, f(x) is approaching 2.But at x = 4/√3 ≈ 2.309, f(x) = √3 ≈ 1.732, which is less than 2. So, that suggests that as x increases from 2 to 4/√3, f(x) decreases, and then as x increases beyond 4/√3, f(x) starts increasing again.Therefore, the critical point at x = 4/√3 is indeed a minimum.Hence, the minimum value of |x| - |y| is √3.Wait, but let me just make sure. Is there a possibility that for negative x, the expression |x| - |y| could be smaller?But since |x| is always positive, and |y| is also positive, whether x is positive or negative, |x| is the same. So, the function |x| - |y| is symmetric with respect to x, so the minimum should occur at the same |x| value regardless of the sign of x.Therefore, the minimum value is indeed √3.But let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from the equation:log₄(x + 2y) + log₄(x - 2y) = 1Combined logs: log₄[(x + 2y)(x - 2y)] = 1Which gives (x + 2y)(x - 2y) = 4^1 = 4So, x² - 4y² = 4Then, solving for y²: y² = (x² - 4)/4So, |y| = √(x² - 4)/2Thus, |x| - |y| = |x| - √(x² - 4)/2Assuming x ≥ 0, so |x| = x, and then f(x) = x - √(x² - 4)/2Taking derivative: f'(x) = 1 - (x)/(2√(x² - 4))Set to zero: 1 = x/(2√(x² - 4))Multiply both sides: 2√(x² - 4) = xSquare both sides: 4(x² - 4) = x² => 4x² - 16 = x² => 3x² = 16 => x² = 16/3 => x = 4/√3Then, y² = (16/3 - 4)/4 = (4/3)/4 = 1/3 => y = ±1/√3Thus, |x| - |y| = 4/√3 - 1/√3 = 3/√3 = √3Yes, that seems consistent. So, I think √3 is indeed the minimum value.Just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Maybe using substitution or parametric equations for the hyperbola.For hyperbola (x²)/4 - y² = 1, we can parametrize it using hyperbolic functions:x = 2 cosh(t)y = sinh(t)Because cosh²(t) - sinh²(t) = 1, so (2 cosh(t))² /4 - (sinh(t))² = cosh²(t) - sinh²(t) = 1, which satisfies the equation.So, substituting into |x| - |y|:|x| - |y| = 2 cosh(t) - |sinh(t)|But since cosh(t) is always positive and greater than or equal to 1, and sinh(t) can be positive or negative, but we take absolute value, so |sinh(t)| = |sinh(t)|.So, we can write:f(t) = 2 cosh(t) - |sinh(t)|But since cosh(t) is even and sinh(t) is odd, we can consider t ≥ 0 without loss of generality because of the absolute value.So, for t ≥ 0, f(t) = 2 cosh(t) - sinh(t)Let me compute this:cosh(t) = (e^t + e^{-t}) / 2sinh(t) = (e^t - e^{-t}) / 2So,f(t) = 2*(e^t + e^{-t})/2 - (e^t - e^{-t})/2Simplify:f(t) = (e^t + e^{-t}) - (e^t - e^{-t})/2Let me compute term by term:First term: (e^t + e^{-t})Second term: -(e^t - e^{-t})/2So, combining:= (e^t + e^{-t}) - (e^t)/2 + (e^{-t})/2= (e^t - e^t/2) + (e^{-t} + e^{-t}/2)= (e^t / 2) + (3 e^{-t} / 2)So, f(t) = (e^t)/2 + (3 e^{-t})/2Now, to find the minimum of f(t), let's take derivative with respect to t:f'(t) = (e^t)/2 - (3 e^{-t})/2Set derivative equal to zero:(e^t)/2 - (3 e^{-t})/2 = 0Multiply both sides by 2:e^t - 3 e^{-t} = 0Bring 3 e^{-t} to the other side:e^t = 3 e^{-t}Multiply both sides by e^t:e^{2t} = 3Take natural logarithm:2t = ln(3)t = (ln 3)/2So, critical point at t = (ln 3)/2.Now, let's compute f(t) at this point:f(t) = (e^{(ln 3)/2})/2 + (3 e^{- (ln 3)/2})/2Simplify:e^{(ln 3)/2} = √3Similarly, e^{- (ln 3)/2} = 1/√3So,f(t) = (√3)/2 + (3*(1/√3))/2 = (√3)/2 + (√3)/2 = √3So, same result as before. Therefore, the minimum value is indeed √3.Therefore, I'm confident that the minimum value of |x| - |y| is √3.**Final Answer**The minimum value of ( |x| - |y| ) is (boxed{sqrt{3}})."},{"question":"Convert the point left( 5, frac{3 pi}{2}, 4 right) in cylindrical coordinates to rectangular coordinates.","answer":"To convert the cylindrical coordinates (5, 3π/2, 4) to rectangular coordinates, I will use the standard conversion formulas.First, I'll calculate the x-coordinate using the formula x = r * cos(θ). Substituting the given values, x = 5 * cos(3π/2). Since cos(3π/2) is 0, the x-coordinate is 0.Next, I'll determine the y-coordinate using the formula y = r * sin(θ). Plugging in the values, y = 5 * sin(3π/2). Knowing that sin(3π/2) is -1, the y-coordinate becomes -5.Finally, the z-coordinate remains the same in both cylindrical and rectangular coordinates, so z = 4.Combining these results, the rectangular coordinates are (0, -5, 4)."},{"question":"Given the inequality 2x+ frac{2}{x-1} geqslant 7 holds for x in (a, +infty), find the minimum value of the real number a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality: (2x + frac{2}{x - 1} geq 7). I need to find the minimum value of the real number (a) such that this inequality holds for all (x) in the interval ((a, +infty)). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I should probably rewrite the inequality to make it easier to handle. Let me subtract 7 from both sides to get everything on one side:(2x + frac{2}{x - 1} - 7 geq 0)So now, the inequality is (2x + frac{2}{x - 1} - 7 geq 0). Maybe I can combine the terms into a single fraction to simplify it. Let's see.To combine these terms, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 1 and (x - 1), so the common denominator would be (x - 1). Let's rewrite each term with this denominator:(2x) can be written as (frac{2x(x - 1)}{x - 1}), right? Because multiplying numerator and denominator by (x - 1) gives that.Similarly, (frac{2}{x - 1}) is already with denominator (x - 1), so that stays the same.And then, the -7 can be written as (frac{-7(x - 1)}{x - 1}).So putting it all together:(frac{2x(x - 1) + 2 - 7(x - 1)}{x - 1} geq 0)Now, let's simplify the numerator:First, expand (2x(x - 1)):(2x^2 - 2x)Then, the constant term is +2.Then, expand (-7(x - 1)):(-7x + 7)So combining all these:(2x^2 - 2x + 2 - 7x + 7)Combine like terms:- The (x^2) term: (2x^2)- The (x) terms: (-2x -7x = -9x)- The constants: (2 + 7 = 9)So the numerator simplifies to (2x^2 - 9x + 9).Therefore, the inequality becomes:(frac{2x^2 - 9x + 9}{x - 1} geq 0)Okay, so now I have a rational inequality: (frac{2x^2 - 9x + 9}{x - 1} geq 0). To solve this, I need to find the critical points where the expression is zero or undefined, and then test the intervals between them.First, let's find the zeros of the numerator and the denominator.The denominator is (x - 1), which is zero when (x = 1). So, the expression is undefined at (x = 1).Now, the numerator is a quadratic: (2x^2 - 9x + 9). Let's find its roots.Using the quadratic formula: (x = frac{9 pm sqrt{81 - 72}}{4})Because (a = 2), (b = -9), (c = 9), so discriminant (D = b^2 - 4ac = 81 - 72 = 9).So, the roots are:(x = frac{9 pm 3}{4})Which gives:(x = frac{9 + 3}{4} = frac{12}{4} = 3)and(x = frac{9 - 3}{4} = frac{6}{4} = frac{3}{2})So, the numerator is zero at (x = frac{3}{2}) and (x = 3).Therefore, the critical points are (x = frac{3}{2}), (x = 1), and (x = 3).Wait, but (x = 1) is a vertical asymptote because the denominator is zero there. So, the critical points divide the real line into intervals:1. ((-infty, 1))2. ((1, frac{3}{2}))3. ((frac{3}{2}, 3))4. ((3, +infty))I need to test each interval to determine the sign of the expression (frac{2x^2 - 9x + 9}{x - 1}) in each interval.But before I do that, let me note that the original inequality is (geq 0), so we are looking for intervals where the expression is positive or zero.Also, since the expression is undefined at (x = 1), we have to exclude that point.Let me make a table to keep track of the signs.First, the critical points in order: (1), (frac{3}{2}), (3).So, the intervals are:1. ( (-infty, 1) )2. ( (1, frac{3}{2}) )3. ( (frac{3}{2}, 3) )4. ( (3, +infty) )Now, let's test each interval.1. For (x < 1), let's pick (x = 0):Numerator: (2(0)^2 - 9(0) + 9 = 9) which is positive.Denominator: (0 - 1 = -1) which is negative.So, overall expression: ( frac{+}{-} = - ). So negative.2. For (1 < x < frac{3}{2}), let's pick (x = 1.25):Numerator: (2(1.25)^2 - 9(1.25) + 9)Calculate step by step:(1.25^2 = 1.5625)(2 * 1.5625 = 3.125)(9 * 1.25 = 11.25)So numerator: (3.125 - 11.25 + 9 = (3.125 + 9) - 11.25 = 12.125 - 11.25 = 0.875), which is positive.Denominator: (1.25 - 1 = 0.25), which is positive.So overall expression: ( frac{+}{+} = + ). Positive.3. For ( frac{3}{2} < x < 3 ), let's pick (x = 2):Numerator: (2(2)^2 - 9(2) + 9 = 8 - 18 + 9 = -1), which is negative.Denominator: (2 - 1 = 1), positive.So overall expression: ( frac{-}{+} = - ). Negative.4. For (x > 3), let's pick (x = 4):Numerator: (2(4)^2 - 9(4) + 9 = 32 - 36 + 9 = 5), positive.Denominator: (4 - 1 = 3), positive.So overall expression: ( frac{+}{+} = + ). Positive.So, summarizing:- Negative in ( (-infty, 1) )- Positive in ( (1, frac{3}{2}) )- Negative in ( (frac{3}{2}, 3) )- Positive in ( (3, +infty) )But remember, the inequality is (geq 0), so we include where the expression is positive or zero.So, the solution set is ( (1, frac{3}{2}] cup [3, +infty) ).But wait, hold on. The original inequality is (2x + frac{2}{x - 1} geq 7). So, the expression is undefined at (x = 1), so we can't include that. At (x = frac{3}{2}) and (x = 3), the expression equals zero, so those points are included.But the question says that the inequality holds for (x in (a, +infty)). So, we need to find the minimal (a) such that for all (x > a), the inequality holds.Looking at the solution set, it's ( (1, frac{3}{2}] cup [3, +infty) ). So, the inequality holds in two intervals: from just above 1 up to 1.5, and then from 3 onwards.But the question is about (x in (a, +infty)). So, if I choose (a = 3), then for all (x > 3), the inequality holds. But if I choose (a) less than 3, say (a = 2), then between 2 and 3, the inequality doesn't hold because the expression is negative there.Wait, but hold on. The solution set is ( (1, frac{3}{2}] cup [3, +infty) ). So, if I pick (a = frac{3}{2}), then for (x > frac{3}{2}), the inequality holds except between (frac{3}{2}) and 3, where it doesn't. So, actually, if I pick (a = 3), then for all (x > 3), the inequality holds. But is there a smaller (a) such that for all (x > a), the inequality holds?Wait, let's think. The solution set is two intervals: ( (1, frac{3}{2}] ) and ( [3, +infty) ). So, if I pick (a = 3), then (x > 3) is entirely within the solution set. If I pick (a) less than 3, say (a = 2), then (x) between 2 and 3 is not in the solution set, so the inequality doesn't hold there. Similarly, if I pick (a = frac{3}{2}), then (x) between (frac{3}{2}) and 3 is not in the solution set. So, the only way to have the inequality hold for all (x > a) is to pick (a) such that the interval ((a, +infty)) is entirely within the solution set.Looking at the solution set, the only interval that goes to infinity is ( [3, +infty) ). So, if I pick (a = 3), then ((3, +infty)) is entirely within the solution set. If I pick (a) less than 3, then part of ((a, +infty)) is outside the solution set. Therefore, the minimal such (a) is 3.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The original inequality is (2x + frac{2}{x - 1} geq 7). Let me test (x = 3):Left side: (2*3 + frac{2}{3 - 1} = 6 + 1 = 7), which is equal to 7, so it satisfies the inequality.What about (x = 4):Left side: (8 + frac{2}{3} approx 8.666), which is greater than 7.What about (x = 2):Left side: (4 + frac{2}{1} = 6), which is less than 7, so the inequality doesn't hold.Similarly, (x = 1.5):Left side: (3 + frac{2}{0.5} = 3 + 4 = 7), which is equal to 7.But for (x) just above 1.5, say (x = 1.6):Left side: (3.2 + frac{2}{0.6} approx 3.2 + 3.333 approx 6.533), which is less than 7. So, the inequality doesn't hold there.Wait, so actually, the solution set is ( (1, frac{3}{2}] cup [3, +infty) ). So, if I pick (a = frac{3}{2}), then for (x > frac{3}{2}), the inequality doesn't hold between (frac{3}{2}) and 3, so it's not true that the inequality holds for all (x > a). Therefore, the only way to have the inequality hold for all (x > a) is to pick (a = 3), because beyond 3, the inequality holds.Therefore, the minimal such (a) is 3.Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\"the inequality holds for (x in (a, +infty))\\", so we need the set ( (a, +infty) ) to be a subset of the solution set. The solution set is ( (1, frac{3}{2}] cup [3, +infty) ). So, the largest interval starting from some (a) that is entirely within the solution set is ( [3, +infty) ). Therefore, the minimal (a) is 3.But wait, another thought: if I take (a) just a little less than 3, say (a = 2.9), then (x) from 2.9 to 3 is not in the solution set, so the inequality doesn't hold there. So, indeed, (a) must be at least 3.Alternatively, if I take (a = frac{3}{2}), then (x) from (frac{3}{2}) to 3 is not in the solution set, so the inequality doesn't hold for all (x > a). Therefore, the minimal (a) is 3.Wait, but let me check the behavior as (x) approaches 1 from the right. At (x) just above 1, say (x = 1.1):Left side: (2*1.1 + frac{2}{0.1} = 2.2 + 20 = 22.2), which is greater than 7.So, near 1, the expression is large and positive. Then, it decreases, reaches 7 at (x = frac{3}{2}), then goes below 7, reaches a minimum, and then increases again to 7 at (x = 3), and continues increasing beyond that.So, the graph of the function (f(x) = 2x + frac{2}{x - 1}) has a vertical asymptote at (x = 1), goes to infinity as (x) approaches 1 from the right, decreases to 7 at (x = frac{3}{2}), continues decreasing to some minimum, then increases back to 7 at (x = 3), and then continues increasing to infinity as (x) approaches infinity.Therefore, the inequality (f(x) geq 7) holds for (x) just above 1 up to (x = frac{3}{2}), and then again from (x = 3) onwards.So, if I want the inequality to hold for all (x > a), I need to choose (a) such that beyond (a), the function is always above 7. The function is above 7 in two intervals: near 1 and beyond 3. So, the only way for (x > a) to be entirely in the solution set is to have (a) at least 3, because beyond 3, the function is increasing and stays above 7.Therefore, the minimal value of (a) is 3.Wait, but let me confirm by testing (x = 3) and (x = 4):At (x = 3), (2*3 + 2/(3 - 1) = 6 + 1 = 7), which is equal to 7.At (x = 4), (8 + 2/3 ≈ 8.666), which is greater than 7.At (x = 5), (10 + 2/4 = 10.5), which is greater than 7.So, beyond (x = 3), the function is increasing and stays above 7.Therefore, the minimal (a) is 3.I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The minimum value of (a) is (boxed{3})."},{"question":"Describe a regular tetrahedron around a sphere of radius (R) and find its volume.","answer":"Okay, so I need to describe a regular tetrahedron around a sphere of radius ( R ) and find its volume. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that a regular tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal in length, and all the faces are congruent. First, I should probably visualize the scenario. The sphere is inscribed inside the tetrahedron, meaning it touches all the faces of the tetrahedron. So, the sphere is the insphere of the tetrahedron. I think the radius ( R ) of the insphere is related to the edge length of the tetrahedron. If I can find the edge length in terms of ( R ), then I can compute the volume.I recall that for a regular tetrahedron, there are some standard formulas relating the edge length to various radii, like the inradius and the circumradius. Let me try to remember or derive these relationships.Let me denote the edge length of the tetrahedron as ( a ). I need to express ( a ) in terms of ( R ). I remember that the inradius ( r ) of a regular tetrahedron is given by ( r = frac{a sqrt{6}}{12} ). Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. The formula for the inradius of a regular tetrahedron is indeed ( r = frac{a sqrt{6}}{12} ). So, since the sphere is inscribed, its radius ( R ) is equal to the inradius ( r ) of the tetrahedron. Therefore, ( R = frac{a sqrt{6}}{12} ). So, if I solve for ( a ), I get:( a = R times frac{12}{sqrt{6}} )Simplify that:( a = R times frac{12}{sqrt{6}} = R times frac{12 sqrt{6}}{6} = R times 2 sqrt{6} )So, ( a = 2 R sqrt{6} ). That gives me the edge length in terms of the inradius ( R ).Now, I need to find the volume of the regular tetrahedron. I remember the formula for the volume ( V ) of a regular tetrahedron in terms of its edge length ( a ) is:( V = frac{a^3}{6 sqrt{2}} )Let me plug in ( a = 2 R sqrt{6} ) into this formula.First, compute ( a^3 ):( a^3 = (2 R sqrt{6})^3 = 8 R^3 (sqrt{6})^3 )Compute ( (sqrt{6})^3 ):( (sqrt{6})^3 = (sqrt{6})^2 times sqrt{6} = 6 times sqrt{6} = 6 sqrt{6} )So, ( a^3 = 8 R^3 times 6 sqrt{6} = 48 R^3 sqrt{6} )Now, plug this back into the volume formula:( V = frac{48 R^3 sqrt{6}}{6 sqrt{2}} )Simplify numerator and denominator:First, 48 divided by 6 is 8.So, ( V = frac{8 R^3 sqrt{6}}{sqrt{2}} )Simplify ( sqrt{6} / sqrt{2} ):( sqrt{6}/sqrt{2} = sqrt{6/2} = sqrt{3} )Therefore, ( V = 8 R^3 sqrt{3} )Wait, hold on, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.Starting from ( V = frac{a^3}{6 sqrt{2}} ) and ( a = 2 R sqrt{6} ):( V = frac{(2 R sqrt{6})^3}{6 sqrt{2}} )Compute numerator:( (2)^3 = 8 )( (R)^3 = R^3 )( (sqrt{6})^3 = 6 sqrt{6} )So, numerator is ( 8 R^3 times 6 sqrt{6} = 48 R^3 sqrt{6} )Denominator is ( 6 sqrt{2} )So, ( V = frac{48 R^3 sqrt{6}}{6 sqrt{2}} = 8 R^3 times frac{sqrt{6}}{sqrt{2}} )Simplify ( sqrt{6}/sqrt{2} = sqrt{3} ), so:( V = 8 R^3 sqrt{3} )Yes, that seems correct. So, the volume of the regular tetrahedron is ( 8 sqrt{3} R^3 ).Wait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake because I recall another formula for the volume in terms of the inradius. Let me see.Alternatively, maybe I can derive the volume using another method to confirm.I know that the volume ( V ) of a regular tetrahedron can also be expressed in terms of its inradius ( R ) and its surface area ( A ). The formula is ( V = frac{1}{3} A R ), similar to how the volume of a pyramid is ( frac{1}{3} times text{base area} times text{height} ).So, if I can compute the surface area ( A ) of the tetrahedron, then I can use this formula to find ( V ).The surface area ( A ) of a regular tetrahedron is 4 times the area of one of its faces. Each face is an equilateral triangle with side length ( a ). The area of an equilateral triangle is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 ). So, the total surface area is:( A = 4 times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 = sqrt{3} a^2 )So, ( A = sqrt{3} a^2 )Then, plugging into ( V = frac{1}{3} A R ):( V = frac{1}{3} times sqrt{3} a^2 times R )But we already have ( a = 2 R sqrt{6} ), so let's plug that in:( V = frac{1}{3} times sqrt{3} times (2 R sqrt{6})^2 times R )Compute ( (2 R sqrt{6})^2 ):( (2)^2 = 4 )( (R)^2 = R^2 )( (sqrt{6})^2 = 6 )So, ( (2 R sqrt{6})^2 = 4 R^2 times 6 = 24 R^2 )Therefore, ( V = frac{1}{3} times sqrt{3} times 24 R^2 times R )Simplify:( V = frac{1}{3} times sqrt{3} times 24 R^3 = 8 sqrt{3} R^3 )Same result! So, that confirms that the volume is indeed ( 8 sqrt{3} R^3 ).Wait, but hold on a second. I just want to make sure that the inradius formula I used earlier is correct because sometimes these formulas can be tricky.Let me recall that for a regular tetrahedron, the inradius ( r ) is related to the edge length ( a ) by ( r = frac{a sqrt{6}}{12} ). Let me verify this.I know that the height ( h ) of a regular tetrahedron (the distance from a vertex to the centroid) is ( h = frac{a sqrt{6}}{3} ). The centroid divides the height in a ratio of 1:3, meaning the inradius is one-fourth of the height? Wait, no, actually, in a regular tetrahedron, the centroid is also the center of the insphere, and the inradius is the distance from the centroid to a face.Wait, perhaps I should derive the inradius.Let me consider a regular tetrahedron with edge length ( a ). Let me compute the inradius ( r ).First, the volume ( V ) is ( frac{a^3}{6 sqrt{2}} ). The surface area ( A ) is ( sqrt{3} a^2 ). Then, since ( V = frac{1}{3} A r ), solving for ( r ):( r = frac{3 V}{A} = frac{3 times frac{a^3}{6 sqrt{2}}}{sqrt{3} a^2} = frac{frac{a^3}{2 sqrt{2}}}{sqrt{3} a^2} = frac{a}{2 sqrt{2} sqrt{3}} = frac{a}{2 sqrt{6}} = frac{a sqrt{6}}{12} )Yes, that's correct. So, ( r = frac{a sqrt{6}}{12} ). So, my initial formula was correct.Therefore, solving for ( a ) gives ( a = frac{12 r}{sqrt{6}} = 2 r sqrt{6} ). Since ( r = R ), we have ( a = 2 R sqrt{6} ).So, plugging back into the volume formula, we get ( V = 8 sqrt{3} R^3 ).Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check another source or method.Alternatively, I can think about the relationship between the inradius and the edge length using coordinates.Let me place the regular tetrahedron in a coordinate system. One way to define a regular tetrahedron is with vertices at ( (1,1,1) ), ( (-1,-1,1) ), ( (-1,1,-1) ), and ( (1,-1,-1) ). But I need to check if this is a regular tetrahedron.Wait, actually, the edge lengths can be computed. The distance between ( (1,1,1) ) and ( (-1,-1,1) ) is ( sqrt{(1 - (-1))^2 + (1 - (-1))^2 + (1 - 1)^2} = sqrt{(2)^2 + (2)^2 + 0} = sqrt{4 + 4} = sqrt{8} = 2 sqrt{2} ). So, edge length is ( 2 sqrt{2} ).The centroid of this tetrahedron is at the average of the coordinates: ( (0,0,0) ). The inradius would be the distance from the centroid to any face.Let me compute the distance from the origin to the face defined by ( (1,1,1) ), ( (-1,-1,1) ), and ( (-1,1,-1) ). First, find the equation of the plane containing these three points.Let me denote the points as ( A(1,1,1) ), ( B(-1,-1,1) ), and ( C(-1,1,-1) ).Compute vectors ( AB = B - A = (-2, -2, 0) ) and ( AC = C - A = (-2, 0, -2) ).Compute the normal vector ( n = AB times AC ).Calculating the cross product:( AB = (-2, -2, 0) )( AC = (-2, 0, -2) )( n_x = (-2)(-2) - (0)(0) = 4 - 0 = 4 )( n_y = -( (-2)(-2) - (0)(-2) ) = - (4 - 0) = -4 )( n_z = (-2)(0) - (-2)(-2) = 0 - 4 = -4 )So, normal vector ( n = (4, -4, -4) ). We can simplify this by dividing by 4: ( n = (1, -1, -1) ).The equation of the plane is ( 1(x - x_0) - 1(y - y_0) - 1(z - z_0) = 0 ). Using point ( A(1,1,1) ):( 1(x - 1) - 1(y - 1) - 1(z - 1) = 0 )Simplify:( x - 1 - y + 1 - z + 1 = 0 )Combine constants:( x - y - z + 1 = 0 )So, the plane equation is ( x - y - z + 1 = 0 ).Now, the distance from the origin ( (0,0,0) ) to this plane is given by:( d = frac{|0 - 0 - 0 + 1|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{1 + 1 + 1}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} )So, the inradius ( r ) is ( frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ).But in this tetrahedron, the edge length is ( 2 sqrt{2} ). So, let's compute ( r ) in terms of ( a ):Given ( a = 2 sqrt{2} ), then ( r = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ). So, ( r = frac{a sqrt{6}}{12} )?Let me check:( frac{a sqrt{6}}{12} = frac{2 sqrt{2} times sqrt{6}}{12} = frac{2 sqrt{12}}{12} = frac{2 times 2 sqrt{3}}{12} = frac{4 sqrt{3}}{12} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} )But in our coordinate system, ( r = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} ). So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the formula ( r = frac{a sqrt{6}}{12} ) is correct.Therefore, my earlier calculations hold. So, the edge length ( a = 2 R sqrt{6} ), and the volume ( V = 8 sqrt{3} R^3 ).Just to recap:1. Recognize that the sphere is the insphere of the regular tetrahedron.2. Use the formula for inradius ( r = frac{a sqrt{6}}{12} ) to express edge length ( a ) in terms of ( R ).3. Substitute ( a ) into the volume formula ( V = frac{a^3}{6 sqrt{2}} ).4. Simplify to find ( V = 8 sqrt{3} R^3 ).5. Verified using an alternative method involving surface area and volume relationship, as well as coordinate geometry.Therefore, I'm confident that the volume of the regular tetrahedron circumscribed around a sphere of radius ( R ) is ( 8 sqrt{3} R^3 ).**Final Answer**The volume of the regular tetrahedron is boxed{8sqrt{3}R^3}."},{"question":"Is it true that in the sequence of natural numbers, every number divisible by 6 has a prime number neighbor?","answer":"Okay, so I came across this interesting question: \\"Is it true that in the sequence of natural numbers, every number divisible by 6 has a prime number neighbor?\\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me understand the question properly. It's asking whether every multiple of 6 has at least one prime number adjacent to it. That is, for any number n that's divisible by 6, either n-1 or n+1 is a prime number. I guess I need to check if this holds true for all multiples of 6.Let me start by listing some multiples of 6 and see if their neighbors are prime. Maybe that will give me a pattern or help me spot a counterexample.Starting from the smallest multiple of 6:1. 6: The neighbors are 5 and 7. Both 5 and 7 are prime numbers. So, yes, 6 has prime neighbors.2. 12: Neighbors are 11 and 13. Again, both are primes. Good.3. 18: Neighbors are 17 and 19. Both primes as well.4. 24: Neighbors are 23 and 25. 23 is prime, but 25 is 5 squared, which is not prime. So, at least one neighbor is prime. Still holds.5. 30: Neighbors are 29 and 31. Both primes.6. 36: Neighbors are 35 and 37. 35 is 5*7, not prime, but 37 is prime.7. 42: Neighbors are 41 and 43. Both primes.8. 48: Neighbors are 47 and 49. 47 is prime, 49 is 7 squared, not prime. Still, one prime neighbor.9. 54: Neighbors are 53 and 55. 53 is prime, 55 is 5*11, not prime.10. 60: Neighbors are 59 and 61. Both primes.11. 66: Neighbors are 65 and 67. 65 is 5*13, not prime; 67 is prime.12. 72: Neighbors are 71 and 73. Both primes.13. 78: Neighbors are 77 and 79. 77 is 7*11, not prime; 79 is prime.14. 84: Neighbors are 83 and 85. 83 is prime, 85 is 5*17, not prime.15. 90: Neighbors are 89 and 91. 89 is prime, 91 is 7*13, not prime.16. 96: Neighbors are 95 and 97. 95 is 5*19, not prime; 97 is prime.17. 102: Neighbors are 101 and 103. Both primes.18. 108: Neighbors are 107 and 109. Both primes.19. 114: Neighbors are 113 and 115. 113 is prime, 115 is 5*23, not prime.20. 120: Neighbors are 119 and 121. 119 is 7*17, not prime; 121 is 11 squared, not prime. Wait, hold on. Both neighbors are not prime here. So, 120 is a multiple of 6, but neither 119 nor 121 is prime. Hmm, that seems like a counterexample.Wait, is 119 prime? Let me double-check. 119 divided by 7 is 17, so yes, 7*17 is 119. So, 119 is composite. 121 is 11 squared, which is definitely composite. So, 120 is a multiple of 6, and neither of its neighbors is prime. That would mean the statement is false.But hold on, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check another multiple of 6 beyond 120 to see if this is an isolated case or a pattern.21. 126: Neighbors are 125 and 127. 125 is 5 cubed, not prime; 127 is prime.22. 132: Neighbors are 131 and 133. 131 is prime, 133 is 7*19, not prime.23. 138: Neighbors are 137 and 139. Both primes.24. 144: Neighbors are 143 and 145. 143 is 11*13, not prime; 145 is 5*29, not prime. So, 144 is another multiple of 6 where neither neighbor is prime.Hmm, so 144 is another counterexample. So, it seems that the statement isn't true for all multiples of 6. There are cases where both neighbors are composite.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I need to check more numbers or see if there's a pattern to these counterexamples.Looking back, 120 and 144 are both multiples of 6. Let me see if they have something in common. 120 is 6*20, 144 is 6*24. Hmm, 20 and 24 are both multiples of 4. Maybe that's a clue? Or perhaps it's related to the fact that 120 and 144 are both highly composite numbers, meaning they have a lot of divisors.But I'm not sure. Let me check another multiple of 6 beyond 144.25. 150: Neighbors are 149 and 151. Both primes.26. 156: Neighbors are 155 and 157. 155 is 5*31, not prime; 157 is prime.27. 162: Neighbors are 161 and 163. 161 is 7*23, not prime; 163 is prime.28. 168: Neighbors are 167 and 169. 167 is prime, 169 is 13 squared, not prime.29. 174: Neighbors are 173 and 175. 173 is prime, 175 is 5*35, not prime.30. 180: Neighbors are 179 and 181. Both primes.31. 186: Neighbors are 185 and 187. 185 is 5*37, not prime; 187 is 11*17, not prime. So, 186 is another multiple of 6 with both neighbors composite.Wait, so 186 is another counterexample. So, it's happening multiple times. So, the initial statement isn't true because there are multiples of 6 where neither neighbor is prime.But let me think about why this is happening. Maybe it's because as numbers get larger, primes become less frequent, so the chance of having a prime neighbor decreases. But even so, primes are still infinite, so maybe it's not about frequency but about specific cases where both neighbors are composite.Alternatively, maybe it's related to the fact that numbers of the form 6k-1 and 6k+1 are often prime, but not always. For example, 6k-1 and 6k+1 are the forms of primes greater than 3, but sometimes they can be composite.Wait, actually, all primes greater than 3 are of the form 6k±1. So, if you take a multiple of 6, say 6k, then 6k-1 and 6k+1 are the numbers adjacent to it. These are the candidates for primes. But sometimes, both can be composite, as we saw with 120 and 144.So, in those cases, both 6k-1 and 6k+1 are composite, meaning neither neighbor is prime. Therefore, the statement isn't true for all multiples of 6.But let me check another multiple beyond 186 to see if this trend continues.32. 192: Neighbors are 191 and 193. Both primes.33. 198: Neighbors are 197 and 199. Both primes.34. 204: Neighbors are 203 and 205. 203 is 7*29, not prime; 205 is 5*41, not prime. So, 204 is another counterexample.35. 210: Neighbors are 209 and 211. 209 is 11*19, not prime; 211 is prime.36. 216: Neighbors are 215 and 217. 215 is 5*43, not prime; 217 is 7*31, not prime. So, 216 is another counterexample.Hmm, so it seems that as numbers get larger, the occurrence of such counterexamples increases. So, the statement isn't universally true.But wait, maybe I should think about why 6k-1 and 6k+1 can both be composite. For example, in the case of 120, 119=7*17 and 121=11². Similarly, 144: 143=11*13 and 145=5*29. 186: 185=5*37 and 187=11*17. 204: 203=7*29 and 205=5*41. 216: 215=5*43 and 217=7*31.So, in each case, both neighbors are composite because they can be factored into smaller primes. So, it's not that these numbers are prime; they're composite, which means the original multiple of 6 doesn't have a prime neighbor.Therefore, the answer is no, it's not true that every multiple of 6 has a prime neighbor. There are counterexamples like 120, 144, 186, 204, 216, etc., where both neighbors are composite.But just to be thorough, let me check a few more multiples of 6 beyond 216.37. 222: Neighbors are 221 and 223. 221 is 13*17, not prime; 223 is prime.38. 228: Neighbors are 227 and 229. Both primes.39. 234: Neighbors are 233 and 235. 233 is prime, 235 is 5*47, not prime.40. 240: Neighbors are 239 and 241. Both primes.41. 246: Neighbors are 245 and 247. 245 is 5*49=5*7², not prime; 247 is 13*19, not prime. So, 246 is another counterexample.42. 252: Neighbors are 251 and 253. 251 is prime, 253 is 11*23, not prime.43. 258: Neighbors are 257 and 259. 257 is prime, 259 is 7*37, not prime.44. 264: Neighbors are 263 and 265. 263 is prime, 265 is 5*53, not prime.45. 270: Neighbors are 269 and 271. Both primes.46. 276: Neighbors are 275 and 277. 275 is 5*55=5*5*11, not prime; 277 is prime.47. 282: Neighbors are 281 and 283. Both primes.48. 288: Neighbors are 287 and 289. 287 is 7*41, not prime; 289 is 17², not prime. So, 288 is another counterexample.49. 294: Neighbors are 293 and 295. 293 is prime, 295 is 5*59, not prime.50. 300: Neighbors are 299 and 301. 299 is 13*23, not prime; 301 is 7*43, not prime. So, 300 is another counterexample.Wow, so it seems that as numbers get larger, the occurrence of multiples of 6 with both neighbors composite becomes more frequent. Therefore, the original statement is false because there are indeed multiples of 6 that do not have a prime neighbor.But just to make sure, let me think about why this happens. It's because for some multiples of 6, both 6k-1 and 6k+1 can be composite. These are called \\"twin composites\\" or something similar. They occur when both numbers are products of primes, which is possible as numbers grow larger.In fact, there's a concept in number theory called \\"prime gaps,\\" which refers to the difference between consecutive prime numbers. As numbers get larger, prime gaps can become larger, meaning there are longer sequences of composite numbers. Therefore, it's possible for both neighbors of a multiple of 6 to be composite, especially as we move to larger numbers.Additionally, considering that primes become less dense as numbers increase, the likelihood of both neighbors being composite increases. This is supported by the Prime Number Theorem, which tells us that the density of primes around a large number n is roughly 1/log n. So, as n grows, the chance that a random number near n is prime decreases, making it more likely that both neighbors of a multiple of 6 are composite.Therefore, after checking several examples and considering the density of primes, it's clear that the statement is not true. There are indeed multiples of 6 that do not have a prime neighbor.I think I've covered enough ground here. I've checked multiple examples, identified counterexamples, and considered the theoretical underpinnings. So, I'm confident in my conclusion."},{"question":"Evaluate log_2frac{1}{16}.","answer":"I need to evaluate the logarithm base 2 of 1/16, which is written as (log_2 frac{1}{16}).First, I recognize that 16 is a power of 2. Specifically, (2^4 = 16). Therefore, (frac{1}{16}) can be expressed as (2^{-4}).Now, the expression becomes (log_2 2^{-4}).Using the logarithmic identity (log_b b^x = x), I can simplify this to just (-4).So, the value of (log_2 frac{1}{16}) is (-4)."},{"question":"Find[sum_{n = 1}^infty frac{n^2 + n - 1}{(n + 2)!}.]","answer":"Alright, so I have this infinite series to find: the sum from n equals 1 to infinity of (n squared plus n minus 1) divided by (n plus 2) factorial. Hmm, okay. Let me write that down to visualize it better:[sum_{n = 1}^infty frac{n^2 + n - 1}{(n + 2)!}]I remember that factorials in the denominator often lead to telescoping series or can be related to known series expansions, like the exponential function. Maybe I can manipulate the numerator to express it in terms that can cancel out or simplify with the factorial in the denominator.First, let's see if I can break down the numerator into parts that might relate to the denominator. The numerator is n squared plus n minus 1. Maybe I can express this as a combination of terms involving (n + 2), (n + 1), and n, since the denominator is (n + 2)! which is (n + 2)(n + 1)n!.Let me try to express n² + n - 1 in terms of (n + 2), (n + 1), and n. Let's see:n² + n - 1. Hmm, maybe I can write this as (n + 2)(n + 1) minus some constants. Let's compute (n + 2)(n + 1):(n + 2)(n + 1) = n² + 3n + 2.Hmm, that's n² + 3n + 2. But our numerator is n² + n - 1. So, if I subtract 2n and subtract 3, I get:(n + 2)(n + 1) - 2n - 3 = n² + 3n + 2 - 2n - 3 = n² + n - 1.Perfect! So, that means:n² + n - 1 = (n + 2)(n + 1) - 2n - 3.So, substituting this back into the original expression:[frac{n^2 + n - 1}{(n + 2)!} = frac{(n + 2)(n + 1) - 2n - 3}{(n + 2)!}]I can split this into two separate fractions:[frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{(n + 2)!} - frac{2n + 3}{(n + 2)!}]Simplify the first term:The numerator is (n + 2)(n + 1), and the denominator is (n + 2)! which is (n + 2)(n + 1)n!. So, the (n + 2)(n + 1) cancels out, leaving 1/n!.So, the first term simplifies to 1/n!.Now, the second term is (2n + 3)/(n + 2)!.Let me write the entire expression now:[frac{1}{n!} - frac{2n + 3}{(n + 2)!}]So, the original series becomes:[sum_{n = 1}^infty left( frac{1}{n!} - frac{2n + 3}{(n + 2)!} right )]I can split this into two separate sums:[sum_{n = 1}^infty frac{1}{n!} - sum_{n = 1}^infty frac{2n + 3}{(n + 2)!}]Let me handle each sum separately.First sum: sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n!.I know that the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n! is e. So, subtracting the n=0 term, which is 1, we get:sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n! = e - 1.Okay, that's straightforward.Now, the second sum: sum from n=1 to infinity of (2n + 3)/(n + 2)!.This looks a bit more complicated. Maybe I can adjust the index to make it easier. Let me let k = n + 2. Then, when n = 1, k = 3, and as n approaches infinity, k approaches infinity as well.So, substituting k = n + 2, which implies n = k - 2.So, the numerator becomes 2(k - 2) + 3 = 2k - 4 + 3 = 2k - 1.And the denominator becomes (n + 2)! = k!.So, the second sum becomes:sum from k=3 to infinity of (2k - 1)/k!.So, let's write that:sum_{k=3}^infty (2k - 1)/k! = sum_{k=3}^infty (2k)/k! - sum_{k=3}^infty 1/k!.Simplify each term:First term: 2k/k! = 2/(k - 1)!.Second term: 1/k!.So, the second sum becomes:2 * sum_{k=3}^infty 1/(k - 1)! - sum_{k=3}^infty 1/k!.Let me adjust the indices for these sums.For the first part: sum_{k=3}^infty 1/(k - 1)!.Let m = k - 1, so when k=3, m=2, and as k approaches infinity, m approaches infinity.So, this becomes sum_{m=2}^infty 1/m!.Similarly, the second part: sum_{k=3}^infty 1/k!.Let me write both sums in terms of m:First part: sum_{m=2}^infty 1/m!.Second part: sum_{m=3}^infty 1/m!.So, putting it together:2 * sum_{m=2}^infty 1/m! - sum_{m=3}^infty 1/m!.Let me compute these.First, sum_{m=2}^infty 1/m! = (sum_{m=0}^infty 1/m!) - 1 - 1/1! = e - 1 - 1 = e - 2.Similarly, sum_{m=3}^infty 1/m! = (sum_{m=0}^infty 1/m!) - 1 - 1 - 1/2! = e - 1 - 1 - 1/2 = e - 2.5.Wait, let me confirm:sum_{m=0}^infty 1/m! = e.sum_{m=2}^infty 1/m! = e - 1 - 1 = e - 2.sum_{m=3}^infty 1/m! = e - 1 - 1 - 1/2 = e - 2.5.Yes, that's correct.So, substituting back:2*(e - 2) - (e - 2.5) = 2e - 4 - e + 2.5 = e - 1.5.So, the second sum is e - 1.5.Therefore, going back to the original expression:First sum: e - 1.Second sum: e - 1.5.So, the original series is:(e - 1) - (e - 1.5) = e - 1 - e + 1.5 = 0.5.Wait, that's 0.5, which is 1/2.Hmm, so the sum is 1/2.Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First sum: sum_{n=1}^infty 1/n! = e - 1. Correct.Second sum: sum_{n=1}^infty (2n + 3)/(n + 2)!.We changed variables to k = n + 2, so n = k - 2, leading to sum_{k=3}^infty (2(k - 2) + 3)/k! = sum_{k=3}^infty (2k - 1)/k!.Then, split into 2*sum_{k=3}^infty k/k! - sum_{k=3}^infty 1/k!.Which is 2*sum_{k=3}^infty 1/(k - 1)! - sum_{k=3}^infty 1/k!.Changing variables for the first sum: m = k - 1, so sum_{m=2}^infty 1/m!.Which is e - 2.Second sum: sum_{k=3}^infty 1/k! = e - 2.5.So, 2*(e - 2) - (e - 2.5) = 2e - 4 - e + 2.5 = e - 1.5.Subtracting this from the first sum: (e - 1) - (e - 1.5) = 0.5.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can approach the second sum differently to confirm.Let me consider the second sum again: sum_{n=1}^infty (2n + 3)/(n + 2)!.Alternatively, perhaps I can express 2n + 3 in terms of (n + 2) and (n + 1) to see if it can telescope.Wait, 2n + 3 = 2(n + 2) - 1.Yes, because 2(n + 2) = 2n + 4, so 2(n + 2) - 1 = 2n + 4 - 1 = 2n + 3.So, 2n + 3 = 2(n + 2) - 1.Therefore, the second term becomes:(2(n + 2) - 1)/(n + 2)! = 2(n + 2)/(n + 2)! - 1/(n + 2)!.Simplify:2/(n + 1)! - 1/(n + 2)!.So, the second sum is sum_{n=1}^infty [2/(n + 1)! - 1/(n + 2)!].So, let's write that:sum_{n=1}^infty 2/(n + 1)! - sum_{n=1}^infty 1/(n + 2)!.Let me adjust the indices for both sums.First sum: let k = n + 1, so when n=1, k=2, and as n approaches infinity, k approaches infinity.So, sum_{k=2}^infty 2/k!.Second sum: let m = n + 2, so when n=1, m=3, and as n approaches infinity, m approaches infinity.So, sum_{m=3}^infty 1/m!.So, putting it together:2*sum_{k=2}^infty 1/k! - sum_{m=3}^infty 1/m!.Compute each sum:sum_{k=2}^infty 1/k! = e - 1 - 1 = e - 2.sum_{m=3}^infty 1/m! = e - 1 - 1 - 1/2 = e - 2.5.So, 2*(e - 2) - (e - 2.5) = 2e - 4 - e + 2.5 = e - 1.5.Same result as before. So, the second sum is indeed e - 1.5.Therefore, the original series is (e - 1) - (e - 1.5) = 0.5.So, the sum converges to 1/2.Alternatively, maybe I can think of another way to approach this, just to make sure.Another approach: perhaps express the original term as a telescoping series.Given that the denominator is (n + 2)!, maybe I can write the numerator as a difference of terms that would telescope when summed.Let me think about the general term:(n² + n - 1)/(n + 2)!.I want to express this as A/(n + 1)! + B/(n + 2)! or something similar.Alternatively, perhaps express it as a difference between consecutive terms.Wait, let me consider the expression I had earlier:(n² + n - 1) = (n + 2)(n + 1) - 2n - 3.So, then:(n² + n - 1)/(n + 2)! = [ (n + 2)(n + 1) - 2n - 3 ] / (n + 2)! = 1/n! - (2n + 3)/(n + 2)!.Which is the same as before.So, I think my initial approach is correct.Alternatively, maybe I can write the numerator as a combination of (n + 2)(n + 1), (n + 2), and constants.But I think the way I did it is the most straightforward.So, to recap:The original series is split into two sums:1. sum_{n=1}^infty 1/n! = e - 1.2. sum_{n=1}^infty (2n + 3)/(n + 2)! = e - 1.5.Subtracting the second sum from the first gives (e - 1) - (e - 1.5) = 0.5.Therefore, the sum is 1/2.Just to make sure, maybe I can compute partial sums numerically and see if they approach 1/2.Let me compute the first few terms:For n=1: (1 + 1 - 1)/(3)! = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.n=2: (4 + 2 - 1)/(4)! = 5/24 ≈ 0.2083.n=3: (9 + 3 - 1)/(5)! = 11/120 ≈ 0.0917.n=4: (16 + 4 - 1)/(6)! = 19/720 ≈ 0.0264.n=5: (25 + 5 - 1)/(7)! = 29/5040 ≈ 0.00575.Adding these up:0.1667 + 0.2083 = 0.375.Plus 0.0917 = 0.4667.Plus 0.0264 = 0.4931.Plus 0.00575 ≈ 0.49885.So, after n=5, the partial sum is approximately 0.49885, which is very close to 0.5. So, that seems to confirm that the sum converges to 1/2.Therefore, I'm confident that the sum is 1/2.**Final Answer**boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}"},{"question":"Given a geometric sequence {a_n} with a common ratio q, and the sum of the first n terms is S_n. If S_{n}+1, S_{n}, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence, then q equals ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\\"Given a geometric sequence {a_n} with a common ratio q, and the sum of the first n terms is S_n. If S_{n} + 1, S_{n}, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence, then q equals ______.\\"Alright, so let's break this down. First, it's a geometric sequence, which means each term is multiplied by a common ratio q. The sum of the first n terms is S_n. Then, they're saying that if we take S_n + 1, S_n, and S_{n+1}, these three terms form an arithmetic sequence. I need to find the value of q.Hmm, okay. Let me recall what an arithmetic sequence is. In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, if I have three terms a, b, c in arithmetic sequence, then b - a = c - b, which implies 2b = a + c.So, applying that to the given terms: S_n + 1, S_n, S_{n+1}. So, the middle term is S_n, and the other two are S_n + 1 and S_{n+1}. Therefore, the condition for an arithmetic sequence is:2 * S_n = (S_n + 1) + S_{n+1}Let me write that equation down:2S_n = S_n + 1 + S_{n+1}Simplify this equation. Let's subtract S_n from both sides:2S_n - S_n = S_n + 1 + S_{n+1} - S_nWhich simplifies to:S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}Hmm, so S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}But wait, S_{n+1} is the sum of the first n+1 terms of the geometric sequence. So, S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1}, where a_{n+1} is the (n+1)th term.So, substituting that into the equation:S_n = 1 + S_n + a_{n+1}Wait, that would mean:S_n = 1 + S_n + a_{n+1}Subtract S_n from both sides:0 = 1 + a_{n+1}So, a_{n+1} = -1Hmm, so the (n+1)th term of the geometric sequence is -1.But in a geometric sequence, each term is q times the previous term. So, a_{n+1} = a_n * q.Therefore, a_n * q = -1.So, a_n = -1 / q.But a_n is also the nth term of the geometric sequence. The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by a_n = a_1 * q^{n-1}, where a_1 is the first term.So, a_1 * q^{n-1} = -1 / qTherefore, a_1 = (-1 / q) / q^{n-1} = -1 / q^nSo, a_1 = -1 / q^nHmm, interesting. So, the first term is related to q and n in that way.But wait, maybe I can find another equation involving S_n.We know that S_n is the sum of the first n terms of the geometric sequence. The formula for the sum of the first n terms is:S_n = a_1 * (1 - q^n) / (1 - q), if q ≠ 1.So, let's write that down:S_n = a_1 * (1 - q^n) / (1 - q)But we also have that a_1 = -1 / q^n, so substituting that into the equation:S_n = (-1 / q^n) * (1 - q^n) / (1 - q)Simplify this:S_n = (-1 / q^n) * (1 - q^n) / (1 - q)Let me compute this step by step.First, (1 - q^n) / (1 - q) is the sum formula, which is correct.Multiplying by (-1 / q^n):S_n = (-1 / q^n) * (1 - q^n) / (1 - q)Let me separate the terms:= (-1 / q^n) * [1 / (1 - q) - q^n / (1 - q)]= (-1 / q^n) * [1 / (1 - q)] + (-1 / q^n) * (- q^n / (1 - q))Simplify each term:First term: (-1 / q^n) * [1 / (1 - q)] = -1 / [q^n (1 - q)]Second term: (-1 / q^n) * (- q^n / (1 - q)) = (1 / q^n) * (q^n / (1 - q)) = 1 / (1 - q)So, combining both terms:S_n = -1 / [q^n (1 - q)] + 1 / (1 - q)Factor out 1 / (1 - q):= [ -1 / q^n + 1 ] / (1 - q )So, S_n = (1 - 1 / q^n) / (1 - q)But let's write it as:S_n = (1 - 1/q^n) / (1 - q)Alternatively, S_n = (1 - q^{-n}) / (1 - q)Hmm, okay. So, that's S_n expressed in terms of q.But we also have another equation from earlier: S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}Wait, let me recall: from the arithmetic sequence condition, we had S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}But S_{n+1} is the sum of the first n+1 terms, so S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1}So, substituting that into S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}:S_n = 1 + S_n + a_{n+1}Which simplifies to 0 = 1 + a_{n+1}, so a_{n+1} = -1, as before.But from the geometric sequence, a_{n+1} = a_n * qAnd a_n = a_1 * q^{n-1}So, a_{n+1} = a_1 * q^{n}But we also have a_{n+1} = -1, so:a_1 * q^n = -1But earlier, we found that a_1 = -1 / q^n, so substituting:(-1 / q^n) * q^n = -1Which simplifies to (-1) = -1, which is an identity. Hmm, that doesn't give us new information.So, perhaps I need another approach.Wait, maybe instead of substituting a_1, I can express S_n and S_{n+1} in terms of q and set up the equation S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}So, let's write S_n and S_{n+1} using the sum formula.S_n = a_1 (1 - q^n) / (1 - q)S_{n+1} = a_1 (1 - q^{n+1}) / (1 - q)So, according to the condition, S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}Therefore,a_1 (1 - q^n) / (1 - q) = 1 + [ a_1 (1 - q^{n+1}) / (1 - q) ]Let me write that equation again:S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}So,a_1 (1 - q^n)/(1 - q) = 1 + a_1 (1 - q^{n+1})/(1 - q)Let me subtract S_{n+1} from both sides:S_n - S_{n+1} = 1But S_n - S_{n+1} = -a_{n+1}, because S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1}, so S_n - S_{n+1} = -a_{n+1}Therefore,- a_{n+1} = 1Which means a_{n+1} = -1, which is consistent with what we had earlier.But perhaps we can use the expressions for S_n and S_{n+1} to set up an equation.So, let's write:a_1 (1 - q^n)/(1 - q) = 1 + a_1 (1 - q^{n+1})/(1 - q)Let me subtract a_1 (1 - q^{n+1})/(1 - q) from both sides:a_1 (1 - q^n)/(1 - q) - a_1 (1 - q^{n+1})/(1 - q) = 1Factor out a_1 / (1 - q):a_1 / (1 - q) [ (1 - q^n) - (1 - q^{n+1}) ] = 1Simplify inside the brackets:(1 - q^n) - (1 - q^{n+1}) = 1 - q^n - 1 + q^{n+1} = q^{n+1} - q^n = q^n (q - 1)So, substituting back:a_1 / (1 - q) * q^n (q - 1) = 1Note that (q - 1) = - (1 - q), so:a_1 / (1 - q) * q^n (- (1 - q)) = 1Simplify:a_1 * q^n * (-1) = 1So,- a_1 q^n = 1Therefore,a_1 q^n = -1But from earlier, we had a_1 q^n = -1, so this is consistent.Hmm, so this doesn't give us a new equation either. It just confirms the earlier result.So, perhaps I need to find another relation. Let's recall that S_n is expressed in terms of a_1 and q.We have S_n = (1 - 1/q^n)/(1 - q), as we derived earlier.But we also have a_1 q^n = -1, so a_1 = -1 / q^nSo, substituting a_1 into the expression for S_n:S_n = a_1 (1 - q^n)/(1 - q) = (-1 / q^n)(1 - q^n)/(1 - q)Simplify:= (-1 / q^n)(1 - q^n)/(1 - q)= (-1)(1 - q^n)/(q^n (1 - q))= (-1)(1 - q^n)/(q^n (1 - q))But 1 - q^n = -(q^n - 1), so:= (-1)(- (q^n - 1))/(q^n (1 - q))= (q^n - 1)/(q^n (1 - q))But 1 - q = -(q - 1), so:= (q^n - 1)/(q^n (- (q - 1)))= -(q^n - 1)/(q^n (q - 1))= (1 - q^n)/(q^n (q - 1))Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, maybe I can write S_n as:S_n = (1 - q^{-n}) / (1 - q)So, let's write that:S_n = (1 - q^{-n}) / (1 - q)Similarly, S_{n+1} = (1 - q^{-(n+1)}) / (1 - q)So, from the condition S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}, let's plug these expressions in:(1 - q^{-n}) / (1 - q) = 1 + (1 - q^{-(n+1)}) / (1 - q)Let me write this equation:(1 - q^{-n}) / (1 - q) = 1 + (1 - q^{-(n+1)}) / (1 - q)Let me subtract (1 - q^{-(n+1)}) / (1 - q) from both sides:[ (1 - q^{-n}) - (1 - q^{-(n+1)}) ] / (1 - q) = 1Simplify the numerator:1 - q^{-n} - 1 + q^{-(n+1)} = q^{-(n+1)} - q^{-n} = q^{-n}(q^{-1} - 1)So, numerator is q^{-n}(q^{-1} - 1)Therefore:[ q^{-n}(q^{-1} - 1) ] / (1 - q) = 1Note that q^{-1} - 1 = (1 - q)/qSo, substituting:[ q^{-n} * (1 - q)/q ] / (1 - q) = 1Simplify:[ q^{-n} * (1 - q) / q ] / (1 - q) = q^{-n} / q = q^{-(n+1)} = 1So,q^{-(n+1)} = 1Which implies that q^{n+1} = 1So, q is a root of unity, specifically, a (n+1)th root of unity.But in a geometric sequence, if q is a root of unity, it can be complex, but the problem doesn't specify whether q is real or complex. However, in most problems like this, unless specified, we consider real numbers.So, if q is real and q^{n+1} = 1, then q must be 1 or -1.But wait, if q = 1, then the geometric sequence would have all terms equal to a_1, and the sum S_n = n a_1. But in the sum formula, if q = 1, S_n = a_1 n, and S_{n+1} = a_1 (n + 1). Then, the condition S_n = 1 + S_{n+1} would imply:n a_1 = 1 + (n + 1) a_1Which simplifies to:n a_1 = 1 + n a_1 + a_1Subtract n a_1:0 = 1 + a_1So, a_1 = -1But if q = 1, then all terms are -1, so S_n = -n, and S_{n+1} = -(n + 1). Then, S_n + 1 = -n + 1, S_n = -n, S_{n+1} = -(n + 1). Are these in arithmetic sequence?Let's check:The difference between S_n and S_n + 1 is (-n) - (-n + 1) = -1The difference between S_{n+1} and S_n is (-(n + 1)) - (-n) = -1So, both differences are -1, so yes, they form an arithmetic sequence.But wait, if q = 1, is that acceptable? Because in the sum formula, when q = 1, the formula S_n = a_1 (1 - q^n)/(1 - q) is undefined, but we can directly compute S_n as n a_1.So, q = 1 is a possible solution.But let's check q = -1.If q = -1, then the geometric sequence alternates between a_1 and -a_1.So, S_n would be:If n is even: S_n = a_1 (1 - (-1)^n)/(1 - (-1)) = a_1 (1 - 1)/2 = 0If n is odd: S_n = a_1 (1 - (-1)^n)/2 = a_1 (1 - (-1))/2 = a_1 (2)/2 = a_1Similarly, S_{n+1} would be:If n is even, then n + 1 is odd: S_{n+1} = a_1If n is odd, then n + 1 is even: S_{n+1} = 0So, let's consider the condition S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}Case 1: n is even.Then, S_n = 0, S_{n+1} = a_1So, 0 = 1 + a_1 => a_1 = -1So, the sequence would be -1, 1, -1, 1, ..., and the sums would be:n even: S_n = (-1 + 1) + ... + (-1 + 1) = 0n odd: S_n = (-1 + 1) + ... + (-1 + 1) + (-1) = -1So, for n even, S_n = 0, S_{n+1} = -1But the condition is S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}, so 0 = 1 + (-1) => 0 = 0, which is true.Wait, but if n is even, S_n = 0, S_{n+1} = -1, so 0 = 1 + (-1) = 0, which holds.But let's check if the three terms S_n + 1, S_n, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence.If n is even:S_n + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1S_n = 0S_{n+1} = -1So, the three terms are 1, 0, -1. Is this an arithmetic sequence?Yes, because the difference is -1 each time: 0 - 1 = -1, -1 - 0 = -1. So, it's arithmetic.Similarly, if n is odd:S_n = -1S_{n+1} = 0So, S_n + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0So, the three terms are 0, -1, 0Wait, is 0, -1, 0 an arithmetic sequence?The differences are -1 and 1, which are not equal. So, it's not an arithmetic sequence.Therefore, if n is odd, the condition is not satisfied.But the problem says \\"the sum of the first n terms is S_n\\", and \\"S_n + 1, S_n, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence\\".So, the condition must hold for some n, or for all n? The problem doesn't specify. It just says \\"the sum of the first n terms is S_n. If S_n + 1, S_n, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence, then q equals ______.\\"So, perhaps n is given, but it's not specified. So, maybe the condition must hold for all n, or for some n.Wait, if the condition must hold for all n, then q = 1 is a solution, as we saw earlier, because for q = 1, the condition holds for any n.But for q = -1, it only holds when n is even, but not when n is odd. So, if the condition must hold for all n, then q = -1 is not a solution.But the problem doesn't specify whether it's for all n or just for some n.Wait, let's re-examine the problem statement:\\"Given a geometric sequence {a_n} with a common ratio q, and the sum of the first n terms is S_n. If S_{n} + 1, S_{n}, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence, then q equals ______.\\"It says \\"the sum of the first n terms is S_n. If S_n + 1, S_n, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence...\\", so it's talking about S_n, S_{n+1}, so it's for a particular n? Or is it for all n?Hmm, the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted as for some n, or for all n.But in the problem statement, it's just given that S_n + 1, S_n, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence, so it's probably for all n, because otherwise, it would have specified \\"for some n\\".But let me think.If it's for all n, then q must satisfy the condition for every n, which would require that q = 1, because for q = -1, it only works when n is even.Alternatively, if it's for some n, then both q = 1 and q = -1 could be solutions, depending on n.But the problem is asking for q, so likely it's a specific value, so probably q = 1 or q = -1.But let's see.Wait, earlier, when we had the equation q^{-(n+1)} = 1, which implies q^{n+1} = 1.So, q is a root of unity, specifically, a (n+1)th root of unity.But if we don't know n, then q must satisfy q^{n+1} = 1 for all n, which is only possible if q = 1, because otherwise, for different n, q would have different roots.But if n is fixed, then q is a (n+1)th root of unity.But the problem doesn't specify n, so perhaps n is arbitrary, so q must satisfy q^{n+1} = 1 for any n, which is only possible if q = 1.But wait, that seems too restrictive. Because for a specific n, q is a (n+1)th root of unity.But since the problem doesn't specify n, maybe it's expecting a general solution, so q must be 1 or -1.Wait, but let's think differently.We had earlier that q^{n+1} = 1, so q is a root of unity. But in the problem, q is the common ratio of a geometric sequence, which is typically considered over the real numbers unless specified otherwise.So, the real roots of unity are only 1 and -1.So, q could be 1 or -1.But when q = 1, as we saw, the condition holds for all n.When q = -1, the condition holds only when n is even.But the problem is just stating that S_n + 1, S_n, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence. It doesn't specify for all n or for some n.So, if it's for some n, then both q = 1 and q = -1 are possible.But in the problem, it's asking for q, so maybe both are possible, but in the answer, it's expecting a single value.Wait, but in the problem statement, it's saying \\"the sum of the first n terms is S_n. If S_n + 1, S_n, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence...\\", so it's given that this holds, so q is determined.But since q could be 1 or -1, but in the case of q = 1, it holds for all n, but for q = -1, it only holds for even n.But unless n is given, we can't specify. So, perhaps the answer is q = 1 or q = -1.But let me check the problem statement again.It says: \\"Given a geometric sequence {a_n} with a common ratio q, and the sum of the first n terms is S_n. If S_{n} + 1, S_{n}, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence, then q equals ______.\\"So, it's given that this condition holds, so q must satisfy it. So, since q^{n+1} = 1, and q is real, then q = 1 or q = -1.But if q = -1, the condition holds only for even n, but if n is arbitrary, then q must be 1.But the problem doesn't specify n, so perhaps it's expecting q = 1.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier.Wait, let's go back.From the equation:q^{-(n+1)} = 1Which implies q^{n+1} = 1So, q is a root of unity of order dividing n+1.But unless n is given, we can't determine q uniquely.Wait, but in the problem, n is just a variable, so unless it's for all n, which would require q = 1, or for some n, which would allow q to be any root of unity.But the problem is asking for q, so perhaps it's expecting a specific value, so maybe q = 1.Alternatively, maybe I missed something.Wait, let's think differently.We had earlier that a_{n+1} = -1.But in a geometric sequence, a_{n+1} = a_1 q^n = -1And S_n = (1 - q^{-n}) / (1 - q)So, let's express S_n in terms of a_1.Since a_1 = -1 / q^n, then S_n = (-1 / q^n)(1 - q^n)/(1 - q) = (-1)(1 - q^n)/(q^n (1 - q)) = (q^n - 1)/(q^n (q - 1))Wait, let me compute S_n:S_n = a_1 (1 - q^n)/(1 - q) = (-1 / q^n)(1 - q^n)/(1 - q)= (-1)(1 - q^n)/(q^n (1 - q))= (q^n - 1)/(q^n (q - 1))Similarly, S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1} = S_n - 1So, S_{n+1} = S_n - 1But from the condition, S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}, which is consistent with S_{n+1} = S_n - 1So, that's consistent.But perhaps we can find another relation.Wait, let's express S_n in terms of q.We have S_n = (q^n - 1)/(q^n (q - 1))Let me write that as:S_n = (q^n - 1)/(q^{n+1} - q^n)Wait, no, denominator is q^n (q - 1)Wait, maybe not helpful.Alternatively, let's write S_n as:S_n = (1 - q^{-n}) / (1 - q)So, S_n = [1 - (1/q)^n] / (1 - q)Similarly, S_{n+1} = [1 - (1/q)^{n+1}] / (1 - q)So, the condition is S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}So,[1 - (1/q)^n] / (1 - q) = 1 + [1 - (1/q)^{n+1}] / (1 - q)Multiply both sides by (1 - q):1 - (1/q)^n = (1 - q) + 1 - (1/q)^{n+1}Simplify the right side:(1 - q) + 1 - (1/q)^{n+1} = 2 - q - (1/q)^{n+1}So, equation becomes:1 - (1/q)^n = 2 - q - (1/q)^{n+1}Let me rearrange:1 - (1/q)^n - 2 + q + (1/q)^{n+1} = 0Simplify:(-1) + q - (1/q)^n + (1/q)^{n+1} = 0Factor out (1/q)^n:= (-1) + q + (1/q)^n (-1 + 1/q) = 0Note that (-1 + 1/q) = -(1 - 1/q) = -(q - 1)/qSo,= (-1) + q + (1/q)^n * (-(q - 1)/q) = 0= (-1) + q - (q - 1)/q^{n+1} = 0So,q - 1 - (q - 1)/q^{n+1} = 0Factor out (q - 1):(q - 1)(1 - 1/q^{n+1}) = 0So, either q - 1 = 0 or 1 - 1/q^{n+1} = 0Case 1: q - 1 = 0 => q = 1Case 2: 1 - 1/q^{n+1} = 0 => 1/q^{n+1} = 1 => q^{n+1} = 1So, q is a (n+1)th root of unity.But since the problem is asking for q, and it's a geometric sequence, which is typically over real numbers, unless specified otherwise.So, real roots of unity are only 1 and -1.So, q = 1 or q = -1.But if q = 1, as we saw earlier, the condition holds for all n.If q = -1, the condition holds only when n is even.But the problem is just stating that S_n + 1, S_n, S_{n+1} form an arithmetic sequence, without specifying n.So, if n is arbitrary, then q must be 1.But if n is given, then q can be -1 as well.But since the problem doesn't specify n, perhaps the answer is q = 1.Alternatively, if n is arbitrary, then q must be 1.But let me think again.Wait, in the equation we derived:(q - 1)(1 - 1/q^{n+1}) = 0So, either q = 1 or q^{n+1} = 1But if q^{n+1} = 1, and q is real, then q = 1 or q = -1 (if n+1 is even).But if n+1 is odd, then q = 1 is the only real solution.But since n is just a positive integer, n+1 can be either even or odd depending on n.But since the problem doesn't specify n, perhaps the only solution that works for all n is q = 1.Alternatively, if the problem is for a specific n, then q can be -1 if n+1 is even, i.e., n is odd.But since the problem doesn't specify n, it's safer to assume that it's for all n, which would require q = 1.But let's test with q = 1.If q = 1, then the sequence is a constant sequence: a, a, a, ...Sum S_n = a * nSo, S_n + 1 = a n + 1, S_n = a n, S_{n+1} = a(n + 1)Are these in arithmetic sequence?The differences:S_n - (S_n + 1) = -1S_{n+1} - S_n = aSo, for it to be arithmetic, -1 must equal aSo, a = -1Therefore, if q = 1, then a = -1, and the condition holds.So, q = 1 is a solution.Similarly, for q = -1, as we saw earlier, it only works when n is even.But since the problem doesn't specify n, perhaps q = 1 is the only solution.Alternatively, if the problem allows for q = -1 with n even, but since n isn't specified, maybe both are acceptable.But the problem is asking for q, so perhaps both 1 and -1 are possible.But in the problem statement, it's asking for q equals ______, suggesting a single answer.So, maybe I need to consider that q = 1 is the only solution that works for all n, so that's the answer.Alternatively, let's think about the initial condition.We had a_{n+1} = -1But in a geometric sequence, a_{n+1} = a_1 q^n = -1And S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}But S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1} = S_n - 1So, S_n = 1 + (S_n - 1) => S_n = S_n, which is always true.Wait, that seems like it's an identity, but we had earlier that a_{n+1} = -1, so a_1 q^n = -1But S_n = a_1 (1 - q^n)/(1 - q)So, if a_1 q^n = -1, then a_1 = -1 / q^nSo, S_n = (-1 / q^n)(1 - q^n)/(1 - q) = (-1)(1 - q^n)/(q^n (1 - q)) = (q^n - 1)/(q^n (q - 1))So, S_n = (q^n - 1)/(q^{n+1} - q^n)But S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}So, S_{n+1} = S_n - 1But S_{n+1} = a_1 (1 - q^{n+1})/(1 - q) = (-1 / q^n)(1 - q^{n+1})/(1 - q) = (-1)(1 - q^{n+1})/(q^n (1 - q)) = (q^{n+1} - 1)/(q^n (q - 1))So, S_{n+1} = (q^{n+1} - 1)/(q^n (q - 1)) = (q - 1/q^n)/(q - 1)Wait, maybe not helpful.But since S_n = 1 + S_{n+1}, then:(q^n - 1)/(q^n (q - 1)) = 1 + (q^{n+1} - 1)/(q^n (q - 1))Multiply both sides by q^n (q - 1):q^n - 1 = q^n (q - 1) + q^{n+1} - 1Simplify the right side:q^n (q - 1) + q^{n+1} - 1 = q^{n+1} - q^n + q^{n+1} - 1 = 2 q^{n+1} - q^n - 1So, equation becomes:q^n - 1 = 2 q^{n+1} - q^n - 1Bring all terms to left side:q^n - 1 - 2 q^{n+1} + q^n + 1 = 0Simplify:2 q^n - 2 q^{n+1} = 0Factor:2 q^n (1 - q) = 0So, either q^n = 0 or 1 - q = 0But q^n = 0 implies q = 0, but in a geometric sequence, q = 0 would make all terms after the first zero, but then S_n would be a_1, and S_{n+1} would also be a_1, so S_n + 1 = a_1 + 1, S_n = a_1, S_{n+1} = a_1So, the three terms would be a_1 + 1, a_1, a_1For these to be in arithmetic sequence, the difference between a_1 and a_1 + 1 is -1, and the difference between a_1 and a_1 is 0, which is not equal. So, q = 0 is not a solution.Therefore, the only solution is 1 - q = 0 => q = 1So, q = 1 is the only solution.Therefore, the answer is q = 1.**Final Answer**The common ratio ( q ) equals boxed{1}."},{"question":"Which of the following statements about the roots of the equation (sqrt{4 x^{2}+2 x+1}-sqrt{4 x^{2}+14 x+5}=6 x+2) is correct?A.

Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis and is always positive because the coefficient of (x^2) is positive. So, the first square root is defined for all real numbers.Now, the second square root is (sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}). Let me check its discriminant as well. The discriminant is (14^2 - 4*4*5 = 196 - 80 = 116). Since the discriminant is positive, this quadratic has two real roots. Let me find them to determine where the expression inside the square root is non-negative.Using the quadratic formula: (x = [-14 pm sqrt{116}]/(2*4)). Simplify (sqrt{116}) as (2sqrt{29}), so the roots are ([-14 pm 2sqrt{29}]/8), which simplifies to ([-7 pm sqrt{29}]/4). So, the expression inside the second square root is non-negative when (x leq [-7 - sqrt{29}]/4) or (x geq [-7 + sqrt{29}]/4).Calculating the approximate values: (sqrt{29}) is about 5.385, so ([-7 - 5.385]/4 ≈ (-12.385)/4 ≈ -3.096), and ([-7 + 5.385]/4 ≈ (-1.615)/4 ≈ -0.404). So, the second square root is defined for (x leq -3.096) or (x geq -0.404).Therefore, the domain of the original equation is the intersection of the domains of both square roots. Since the first square root is defined everywhere, the domain is (x leq -3.096) or (x geq -0.404).Next, let me look at the right side of the equation: (6x + 2). Since square roots are always non-negative, the left side is the difference of two non-negative numbers. So, the right side must also be non-negative because the left side equals the right side. Therefore, (6x + 2 geq 0), which implies (x geq -1/3 ≈ -0.333).But from the domain, (x) must be either (x leq -3.096) or (x geq -0.404). Combining this with (x geq -1/3 ≈ -0.333), the overlapping intervals are (x geq -0.333). However, the domain requires (x geq -0.404). So, the effective domain is (x geq -0.404).Wait, but (x geq -0.333) is more restrictive than (x geq -0.404), so actually, the domain is (x geq -0.333). Hmm, let me double-check that.Wait, the right side (6x + 2) must be non-negative, so (6x + 2 geq 0) gives (x geq -1/3 ≈ -0.333). But the domain from the square roots is (x leq -3.096) or (x geq -0.404). So, the overlap is (x geq -0.333) because (x geq -0.333) is within (x geq -0.404). So, the domain is (x geq -1/3).Wait, actually, no. The domain is the intersection of (x leq -3.096) or (x geq -0.404) with (x geq -1/3). So, (x geq -1/3) is more restrictive than (x geq -0.404), so the domain is (x geq -1/3).But wait, (x geq -1/3) is approximately (x geq -0.333), which is greater than (-0.404), so the domain is (x geq -0.333). So, the equation is only defined for (x geq -1/3).Okay, so now I know the domain is (x geq -1/3). Let me note that.Now, let me try to solve the equation. It's a bit complicated because of the square roots, so I might need to square both sides to eliminate them. But I have to remember that squaring can introduce extraneous solutions, so I need to check any solutions I get.Let me denote the equation as:(sqrt{4x^2 + 2x + 1} - sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5} = 6x + 2).Let me move one of the square roots to the other side:(sqrt{4x^2 + 2x + 1} = sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5} + 6x + 2).Now, I'll square both sides to eliminate the square roots:((sqrt{4x^2 + 2x + 1})^2 = (sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5} + 6x + 2)^2).Simplify the left side:(4x^2 + 2x + 1 = (sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5})^2 + 2*(6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5} + (6x + 2)^2).Simplify each term on the right side:First term: (4x^2 + 14x + 5).Second term: (2*(6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).Third term: ((6x + 2)^2 = 36x^2 + 24x + 4).So, putting it all together:Left side: (4x^2 + 2x + 1).Right side: (4x^2 + 14x + 5 + 2*(6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5} + 36x^2 + 24x + 4).Combine like terms on the right side:First, combine the quadratic terms: (4x^2 + 36x^2 = 40x^2).Next, the linear terms: (14x + 24x = 38x).Constant terms: (5 + 4 = 9).So, right side becomes: (40x^2 + 38x + 9 + 2*(6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).Now, set the equation:(4x^2 + 2x + 1 = 40x^2 + 38x + 9 + 2*(6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).Let me move all terms except the square root term to the left side:(4x^2 + 2x + 1 - 40x^2 - 38x - 9 = 2*(6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).Simplify the left side:Combine (4x^2 - 40x^2 = -36x^2).Combine (2x - 38x = -36x).Combine (1 - 9 = -8).So, left side is: (-36x^2 - 36x - 8).So, equation becomes:(-36x^2 - 36x - 8 = 2*(6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).Let me factor out a common factor on the left side. I see that all coefficients are divisible by -4:(-4*(9x^2 + 9x + 2) = 2*(6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).Alternatively, I can factor out a -4 or maybe just keep it as is. Let me see.Alternatively, I can write it as:(-36x^2 - 36x - 8 = 2*(6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).Let me divide both sides by 2 to simplify:(-18x^2 - 18x - 4 = (6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).Hmm, the left side is negative because of the negative coefficients, but the right side is a product of (6x + 2) and a square root, which is non-negative. So, let me check the sign.Given that (x geq -1/3), let's see the sign of (6x + 2). At (x = -1/3), (6*(-1/3) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0). For (x > -1/3), (6x + 2 > 0). So, (6x + 2) is non-negative in the domain.The square root (sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}) is always non-negative. Therefore, the right side is non-negative (since it's a product of non-negative terms). The left side is (-18x^2 - 18x - 4), which is a quadratic with a negative leading coefficient, so it opens downward. Let me check its value at (x = -1/3):(-18*(-1/3)^2 - 18*(-1/3) - 4 = -18*(1/9) + 6 - 4 = -2 + 6 - 4 = 0).So, at (x = -1/3), the left side is 0, and the right side is 0 as well. So, (x = -1/3) is a solution? Wait, but let me check.Wait, when I plug (x = -1/3) into the original equation:Left side: (sqrt{4*(-1/3)^2 + 2*(-1/3) + 1} - sqrt{4*(-1/3)^2 + 14*(-1/3) + 5}).Calculate each square root:First sqrt: (4*(1/9) - 2/3 + 1 = 4/9 - 6/9 + 9/9 = (4 - 6 + 9)/9 = 7/9). So, sqrt(7/9) = (sqrt{7}/3 ≈ 0.8819).Second sqrt: (4*(1/9) - 14/3 + 5 = 4/9 - 42/9 + 45/9 = (4 - 42 + 45)/9 = 7/9). So, sqrt(7/9) = (sqrt{7}/3 ≈ 0.8819).So, left side: (0.8819 - 0.8819 = 0).Right side: (6*(-1/3) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0).So, yes, (x = -1/3) is a solution.But wait, earlier, I thought the domain was (x geq -1/3), but actually, when I checked the domain, I concluded that the domain is (x geq -1/3). So, (x = -1/3) is included.But let me go back to the equation after squaring:(-18x^2 - 18x - 4 = (6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).At (x = -1/3), both sides are 0, so it's a valid solution.Now, let's consider the equation:(-18x^2 - 18x - 4 = (6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).Let me denote (A = -18x^2 - 18x - 4) and (B = (6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).We have (A = B). Since (B geq 0) (as established earlier), (A) must also be non-negative. So, (-18x^2 - 18x - 4 geq 0).Let me solve this inequality:(-18x^2 - 18x - 4 geq 0).Multiply both sides by -1 (remember to reverse the inequality):(18x^2 + 18x + 4 leq 0).Now, solve (18x^2 + 18x + 4 leq 0).First, find the roots of the quadratic equation (18x^2 + 18x + 4 = 0).Using the quadratic formula:(x = [-18 pm sqrt{(18)^2 - 4*18*4}]/(2*18)).Calculate discriminant:(324 - 288 = 36).So, roots are:(x = [-18 pm 6]/36).Thus,(x = (-18 + 6)/36 = (-12)/36 = -1/3),and(x = (-18 - 6)/36 = (-24)/36 = -2/3).So, the quadratic (18x^2 + 18x + 4) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is ≤ 0 between its roots. Therefore, the inequality (18x^2 + 18x + 4 leq 0) holds for (x in [-2/3, -1/3]).But our domain is (x geq -1/3). So, the overlap is only at (x = -1/3). Therefore, the only solution from this equation is (x = -1/3).Wait, but earlier, I thought (x = -1/3) is a solution, but let me check if there are other solutions.Wait, when I squared the equation, I might have introduced extraneous solutions, so I need to check if (x = -1/3) is indeed a solution, which it is, as we saw earlier.But let me see if there are other solutions. Let me consider the equation:(-18x^2 - 18x - 4 = (6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).We can square both sides again to eliminate the square root, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, let me consider substituting (y = x + 1/3) to see if it simplifies, but maybe that's overcomplicating.Alternatively, let me rearrange the equation:(-18x^2 - 18x - 4 = (6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).Let me move all terms to one side:(-18x^2 - 18x - 4 - (6x + 2)*sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5} = 0).This seems messy. Alternatively, let me denote (t = sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}). Then, (t^2 = 4x^2 + 14x + 5).But from the original equation, we have:(sqrt{4x^2 + 2x + 1} = t + 6x + 2).Let me square both sides again:(4x^2 + 2x + 1 = t^2 + 2*(6x + 2)*t + (6x + 2)^2).But (t^2 = 4x^2 + 14x + 5), so substitute:(4x^2 + 2x + 1 = (4x^2 + 14x + 5) + 2*(6x + 2)*t + (36x^2 + 24x + 4)).Simplify the right side:Combine (4x^2 + 36x^2 = 40x^2).Combine (14x + 24x = 38x).Combine (5 + 4 = 9).So, right side is (40x^2 + 38x + 9 + 2*(6x + 2)*t).So, equation becomes:(4x^2 + 2x + 1 = 40x^2 + 38x + 9 + 2*(6x + 2)*t).Bring all terms to the left:(4x^2 + 2x + 1 - 40x^2 - 38x - 9 = 2*(6x + 2)*t).Simplify:(-36x^2 - 36x - 8 = 2*(6x + 2)*t).Which is the same equation as before. So, we're back to where we started.Alternatively, let me try to express (t) in terms of (x):From (-36x^2 - 36x - 8 = 2*(6x + 2)*t), we can solve for (t):(t = (-36x^2 - 36x - 8)/(2*(6x + 2))).Simplify numerator and denominator:Factor numerator: Let's factor out -4: (-4*(9x^2 + 9x + 2)).Denominator: (2*(6x + 2) = 2*2*(3x + 1) = 4*(3x + 1)).So, (t = (-4*(9x^2 + 9x + 2))/(4*(3x + 1)) = (- (9x^2 + 9x + 2))/(3x + 1)).So, (t = - (9x^2 + 9x + 2)/(3x + 1)).But (t = sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}), which is non-negative. So, the right side must also be non-negative.So, (- (9x^2 + 9x + 2)/(3x + 1) geq 0).Let me analyze this inequality.First, note that (3x + 1) is in the denominator, so (3x + 1 neq 0), which implies (x neq -1/3). But in our domain, (x geq -1/3), so (3x + 1 geq 0). At (x = -1/3), (3x + 1 = 0), but we already considered that case earlier.So, for (x > -1/3), (3x + 1 > 0).Therefore, the inequality (- (9x^2 + 9x + 2)/(3x + 1) geq 0) simplifies to:(- (9x^2 + 9x + 2) geq 0) because (3x + 1 > 0).Which is equivalent to:(9x^2 + 9x + 2 leq 0).Let me solve (9x^2 + 9x + 2 leq 0).Find the roots of (9x^2 + 9x + 2 = 0).Using quadratic formula:(x = [-9 pm sqrt{81 - 72}]/18 = [-9 pm 3]/18).So, roots are:(x = (-9 + 3)/18 = (-6)/18 = -1/3),and(x = (-9 - 3)/18 = (-12)/18 = -2/3).So, the quadratic (9x^2 + 9x + 2) is positive outside the interval ([-2/3, -1/3]) and negative inside. But since our domain is (x geq -1/3), the inequality (9x^2 + 9x + 2 leq 0) holds only at (x = -1/3), where it equals zero.Therefore, the only solution is (x = -1/3), which we already found.So, does this mean that the equation has only one real root at (x = -1/3)?Wait, but let me check if there are other solutions. Let me consider the original equation again.Original equation:(sqrt{4x^2 + 2x + 1} - sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5} = 6x + 2).We found (x = -1/3) as a solution. Let me test another value in the domain to see if there might be another solution.Let me pick (x = 0):Left side: (sqrt{0 + 0 + 1} - sqrt{0 + 0 + 5} = 1 - sqrt{5} ≈ 1 - 2.236 ≈ -1.236).Right side: (0 + 2 = 2).So, left side ≈ -1.236, right side = 2. Not equal.Another test: (x = 1):Left side: (sqrt{4 + 2 + 1} - sqrt{4 + 14 + 5} = sqrt{7} - sqrt{23} ≈ 2.6458 - 4.796 ≈ -2.1502).Right side: (6 + 2 = 8). Not equal.Another test: (x = -0.2) (which is greater than -1/3 ≈ -0.333).Left side: (sqrt{4*(0.04) + 2*(-0.2) + 1} - sqrt{4*(0.04) + 14*(-0.2) + 5}).Calculate each sqrt:First sqrt: (0.16 - 0.4 + 1 = 0.76). So, sqrt(0.76) ≈ 0.872.Second sqrt: (0.16 - 2.8 + 5 = 2.36). So, sqrt(2.36) ≈ 1.536.Left side: 0.872 - 1.536 ≈ -0.664.Right side: (6*(-0.2) + 2 = -1.2 + 2 = 0.8).Not equal.Another test: (x = -0.4). Wait, but (x = -0.4) is less than -1/3 ≈ -0.333, so it's not in the domain. So, can't test that.Wait, but earlier, I thought the domain was (x geq -1/3), so let me pick (x = -0.3).Left side: (sqrt{4*(0.09) + 2*(-0.3) + 1} - sqrt{4*(0.09) + 14*(-0.3) + 5}).Calculate each sqrt:First sqrt: (0.36 - 0.6 + 1 = 0.76). So, sqrt(0.76) ≈ 0.872.Second sqrt: (0.36 - 4.2 + 5 = 1.16). So, sqrt(1.16) ≈ 1.077.Left side: 0.872 - 1.077 ≈ -0.205.Right side: (6*(-0.3) + 2 = -1.8 + 2 = 0.2).Not equal.Hmm, so far, only (x = -1/3) seems to satisfy the equation. Let me try (x = -0.25).Left side: (sqrt{4*(0.0625) + 2*(-0.25) + 1} - sqrt{4*(0.0625) + 14*(-0.25) + 5}).First sqrt: (0.25 - 0.5 + 1 = 0.75). sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.866.Second sqrt: (0.25 - 3.5 + 5 = 1.75). sqrt(1.75) ≈ 1.322.Left side: 0.866 - 1.322 ≈ -0.456.Right side: (6*(-0.25) + 2 = -1.5 + 2 = 0.5).Not equal.Wait, maybe I should try to see if there's another solution by considering the behavior of both sides.Let me analyze the function (f(x) = sqrt{4x^2 + 2x + 1} - sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}) and (g(x) = 6x + 2).We know that at (x = -1/3), (f(x) = 0) and (g(x) = 0), so they intersect there.Let me see the behavior as (x) approaches infinity.As (x to infty), let's approximate the square roots.(sqrt{4x^2 + 2x + 1} ≈ 2x + (2x)/(2*2x) = 2x + 0.5), using the binomial approximation.Similarly, (sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5} ≈ 2x + (14x)/(2*2x) = 2x + 3.5).So, (f(x) ≈ (2x + 0.5) - (2x + 3.5) = -3).Meanwhile, (g(x) = 6x + 2) tends to infinity. So, as (x to infty), (f(x) to -3) and (g(x) to infty). So, they don't intersect there.What about as (x) approaches just above (-1/3)?Let me consider (x) slightly greater than (-1/3), say (x = -1/3 + epsilon), where (epsilon) is a small positive number.Compute (f(x)):(sqrt{4x^2 + 2x + 1}) and (sqrt{4x^2 + 14x + 5}).At (x = -1/3), both square roots are (sqrt{7/9}), so their difference is 0.As (x) increases slightly above (-1/3), let's see how each square root changes.Let me compute the derivatives to see the behavior.But maybe that's too involved. Alternatively, let me compute (f(x)) and (g(x)) at (x = -0.3):Wait, I already did that earlier, and (f(-0.3) ≈ -0.205), (g(-0.3) = 0.2). So, (f(x)) is negative, (g(x)) is positive, so they don't intersect there.At (x = -1/3), both are 0.Let me check (x = -0.25), which is greater than (-1/3). As above, (f(-0.25) ≈ -0.456), (g(-0.25) = 0.5). So, (f(x)) is negative, (g(x)) is positive.At (x = 0), (f(0) = 1 - sqrt{5} ≈ -1.236), (g(0) = 2). So, (f(x)) is negative, (g(x)) is positive.At (x = 1), (f(1) ≈ -2.1502), (g(1) = 8). So, (f(x)) is negative, (g(x)) is positive.So, it seems that for all (x > -1/3), (f(x)) is negative or zero, while (g(x)) is positive or zero. They only intersect at (x = -1/3).Therefore, the equation has only one real root at (x = -1/3).Now, let me check the options:A. The equation has no negative real roots.But (x = -1/3) is a negative real root, so A is incorrect.B. The equation has no rational roots.But (x = -1/3) is a rational root, so B is incorrect.C. The equation has two real roots.But we found only one real root, so C is incorrect.D. The equation has only one real root.Yes, that's correct.So, the correct answer is D."},{"question":"If e^{i theta} = frac{2 + i sqrt{5}}{3}, then find sin 4 theta.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: If ( e^{i theta} = frac{2 + i sqrt{5}}{3} ), then find ( sin 4theta ). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that ( e^{i theta} ) is related to Euler's formula, which says that ( e^{i theta} = cos theta + i sin theta ). So, in this case, ( cos theta + i sin theta = frac{2 + i sqrt{5}}{3} ). That means I can equate the real and imaginary parts to find ( cos theta ) and ( sin theta ).So, the real part is ( cos theta = frac{2}{3} ) and the imaginary part is ( sin theta = frac{sqrt{5}}{3} ). Let me write that down:( cos theta = frac{2}{3} )( sin theta = frac{sqrt{5}}{3} )Okay, so that's straightforward. Now, the question asks for ( sin 4theta ). Hmm, I need to find the sine of four times theta. I remember there are multiple ways to approach this. One way is to use multiple-angle formulas, like the double-angle or quadruple-angle formulas. Alternatively, I could express ( e^{i 4theta} ) and then take the imaginary part, since ( e^{i 4theta} = cos 4theta + i sin 4theta ), so the imaginary part would be ( sin 4theta ).Let me consider both approaches and see which one is easier.First, let's try the multiple-angle formulas. I know that ( sin 4theta ) can be expressed in terms of ( sin theta ) and ( cos theta ). The formula for ( sin 4theta ) is ( 2 sin 2theta cos 2theta ), and ( sin 2theta = 2 sin theta cos theta ), while ( cos 2theta ) can be expressed in multiple ways, such as ( 1 - 2 sin^2 theta ) or ( 2 cos^2 theta - 1 ).Alternatively, another formula for ( sin 4theta ) is ( 4 sin theta cos theta cos 2theta ), which might be useful. Let me write down the formula:( sin 4theta = 2 sin 2theta cos 2theta )And since ( sin 2theta = 2 sin theta cos theta ), and ( cos 2theta = 1 - 2 sin^2 theta ) or ( 2 cos^2 theta - 1 ). Let me compute ( sin 2theta ) and ( cos 2theta ) first.Given that ( sin theta = frac{sqrt{5}}{3} ) and ( cos theta = frac{2}{3} ), let's compute ( sin 2theta ):( sin 2theta = 2 sin theta cos theta = 2 times frac{sqrt{5}}{3} times frac{2}{3} = frac{4 sqrt{5}}{9} )Okay, that's ( sin 2theta ). Now, let's compute ( cos 2theta ). I'll use the identity ( cos 2theta = 2 cos^2 theta - 1 ):( cos 2theta = 2 times left( frac{2}{3} right)^2 - 1 = 2 times frac{4}{9} - 1 = frac{8}{9} - 1 = -frac{1}{9} )So, ( cos 2theta = -frac{1}{9} ). Now, plug these into the formula for ( sin 4theta ):( sin 4theta = 2 times sin 2theta times cos 2theta = 2 times frac{4 sqrt{5}}{9} times left( -frac{1}{9} right) )Let me compute that:First, multiply the constants: 2 times ( frac{4 sqrt{5}}{9} ) is ( frac{8 sqrt{5}}{9} ). Then, multiply by ( -frac{1}{9} ):( frac{8 sqrt{5}}{9} times left( -frac{1}{9} right) = -frac{8 sqrt{5}}{81} )So, ( sin 4theta = -frac{8 sqrt{5}}{81} ). Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check using another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Another approach is to use the expression for ( e^{i 4theta} ). Since ( e^{i theta} = frac{2 + i sqrt{5}}{3} ), then ( e^{i 4theta} = left( e^{i theta} right)^4 = left( frac{2 + i sqrt{5}}{3} right)^4 ).So, if I compute ( left( frac{2 + i sqrt{5}}{3} right)^4 ), the imaginary part of that will be ( sin 4theta ). Let me compute that.First, let me compute ( left( 2 + i sqrt{5} right)^4 ). That might be a bit tedious, but let's do it step by step.First, compute ( (2 + i sqrt{5})^2 ):( (2 + i sqrt{5})^2 = 2^2 + 2 times 2 times i sqrt{5} + (i sqrt{5})^2 = 4 + 4i sqrt{5} + (i^2 times 5) = 4 + 4i sqrt{5} - 5 = -1 + 4i sqrt{5} )Okay, so ( (2 + i sqrt{5})^2 = -1 + 4i sqrt{5} ). Now, let's compute ( (-1 + 4i sqrt{5})^2 ) to get ( (2 + i sqrt{5})^4 ):( (-1 + 4i sqrt{5})^2 = (-1)^2 + 2 times (-1) times 4i sqrt{5} + (4i sqrt{5})^2 = 1 - 8i sqrt{5} + 16 times i^2 times 5 )Simplify each term:1. ( (-1)^2 = 1 )2. ( 2 times (-1) times 4i sqrt{5} = -8i sqrt{5} )3. ( (4i sqrt{5})^2 = 16 times i^2 times 5 = 16 times (-1) times 5 = -80 )So, putting it all together:( 1 - 8i sqrt{5} - 80 = (1 - 80) - 8i sqrt{5} = -79 - 8i sqrt{5} )Therefore, ( (2 + i sqrt{5})^4 = -79 - 8i sqrt{5} ). Now, since ( e^{i 4theta} = left( frac{2 + i sqrt{5}}{3} right)^4 = frac{(2 + i sqrt{5})^4}{3^4} = frac{-79 - 8i sqrt{5}}{81} ).So, ( e^{i 4theta} = frac{-79}{81} + i times frac{-8 sqrt{5}}{81} ). Therefore, the imaginary part is ( frac{-8 sqrt{5}}{81} ), which is ( sin 4theta ). So, that's the same result as before: ( sin 4theta = -frac{8 sqrt{5}}{81} ).Wait, that's consistent with the first method. So, that gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.Alternatively, I could have used De Moivre's theorem, which states that ( ( cos theta + i sin theta )^n = cos ntheta + i sin ntheta ). So, in this case, ( ( cos theta + i sin theta )^4 = cos 4theta + i sin 4theta ). Since ( e^{i theta} = cos theta + i sin theta ), raising it to the 4th power gives ( e^{i 4theta} = cos 4theta + i sin 4theta ), which is exactly what I did in the second method.So, both methods lead me to the same result, which is ( sin 4theta = -frac{8 sqrt{5}}{81} ).Just to make sure, let me verify the computations again.First, computing ( (2 + i sqrt{5})^2 ):( 2^2 = 4 ), ( 2 times 2 times i sqrt{5} = 4i sqrt{5} ), ( (i sqrt{5})^2 = i^2 times 5 = -5 ). So, 4 + 4i√5 -5 = -1 + 4i√5. Correct.Then, squaring that: (-1)^2 = 1, 2*(-1)*(4i√5) = -8i√5, (4i√5)^2 = 16*(i^2)*5 = 16*(-1)*5 = -80. So, 1 -8i√5 -80 = -79 -8i√5. Correct.Divided by 3^4 = 81, so ( e^{i4theta} = (-79 -8i√5)/81 ). So, imaginary part is -8√5 /81. Correct.Alternatively, using the multiple-angle formula:We found ( sin 2theta = 4√5 /9 ), ( cos 2theta = -1/9 ). Then, ( sin 4theta = 2 times (4√5 /9) times (-1/9) = -8√5 /81 ). Same result.So, both methods give the same answer, so I think that's solid.Wait, just to make sure, let me check if ( cos theta = 2/3 ) and ( sin theta = √5 /3 ) satisfy ( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta = 1 ).Compute ( (2/3)^2 + (√5 /3)^2 = 4/9 + 5/9 = 9/9 = 1 ). Yes, that's correct. So, the initial values are consistent.Therefore, I can be confident that ( sin 4theta = -8√5 /81 ).**Final Answer**The value of ( sin 4theta ) is boxed{-dfrac{8sqrt{5}}{81}}."},{"question":"Rowena is able to mow frac{2}{5} of a lawn in 18 minutes.

Find the sum of the cubes of the terms of this series.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an infinite geometric series. The sum of the terms is 2, and the sum of the squares of the terms is 6. I need to find the sum of the cubes of the terms. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that for an infinite geometric series, the sum S is given by S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio, right? And this works as long as |r| < 1 so that the series converges.So, in this problem, the sum is 2. That gives me the equation:a / (1 - r) = 2.  [Equation 1]Now, the sum of the squares of the terms is another geometric series. I think the formula for the sum of squares of an infinite geometric series is similar, but with each term squared. So, the first term becomes a², and the common ratio becomes r². Therefore, the sum of the squares S_sq is:S_sq = a² / (1 - r²) = 6.  [Equation 2]So, now I have two equations:1) a / (1 - r) = 22) a² / (1 - r²) = 6I need to solve these two equations to find a and r, and then use those to find the sum of the cubes.Let me see. From Equation 1, I can solve for a in terms of r. So, a = 2(1 - r). That seems straightforward.Now, let me substitute this expression for a into Equation 2. So, replacing a with 2(1 - r):[ (2(1 - r))² ] / (1 - r²) = 6Let me compute the numerator first: (2(1 - r))² is 4(1 - r)².So, the equation becomes:4(1 - r)² / (1 - r²) = 6Hmm, I can simplify the denominator. 1 - r² is a difference of squares, so it factors into (1 - r)(1 + r). So, let's write that:4(1 - r)² / [(1 - r)(1 + r)] = 6Now, I can cancel out one (1 - r) term from the numerator and denominator:4(1 - r) / (1 + r) = 6Okay, so now I have:4(1 - r) / (1 + r) = 6Let me solve for r. Multiply both sides by (1 + r):4(1 - r) = 6(1 + r)Expanding both sides:4 - 4r = 6 + 6rNow, let's bring all terms to one side. Subtract 6 from both sides:4 - 4r - 6 = 6rSimplify 4 - 6:-2 - 4r = 6rNow, add 4r to both sides:-2 = 10rSo, r = -2 / 10 = -1/5.Alright, so the common ratio r is -1/5. Now, let's find a using Equation 1:a = 2(1 - r) = 2(1 - (-1/5)) = 2(1 + 1/5) = 2(6/5) = 12/5.So, a is 12/5 and r is -1/5.Now, the problem asks for the sum of the cubes of the terms of this series. So, similar to the sum of the series and the sum of the squares, the sum of the cubes will also be a geometric series, but with each term cubed.So, the first term will be a³, and the common ratio will be r³. Therefore, the sum S_cubed is:S_cubed = a³ / (1 - r³)Let me compute a³ and r³.First, a = 12/5, so a³ = (12/5)³ = (12³)/(5³) = 1728 / 125.Next, r = -1/5, so r³ = (-1/5)³ = -1 / 125.Therefore, 1 - r³ = 1 - (-1/125) = 1 + 1/125 = 126/125.So, plugging back into S_cubed:S_cubed = (1728 / 125) / (126 / 125) = (1728 / 125) * (125 / 126)The 125s cancel out, so we have:1728 / 126Now, let's simplify this fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 6:1728 ÷ 6 = 288126 ÷ 6 = 21So, now it's 288 / 21.Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3:288 ÷ 3 = 9621 ÷ 3 = 7So, now it's 96 / 7.Wait, 96 divided by 7 is approximately 13.714, but since we're dealing with fractions, 96/7 is the exact value.Let me check if 96 and 7 have any common factors. 7 is prime, and 7 doesn't divide into 96, so 96/7 is the simplest form.So, the sum of the cubes is 96/7.Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Sum of the series: a / (1 - r) = 2 => a = 2(1 - r)2. Sum of squares: a² / (1 - r²) = 6 => substituted a = 2(1 - r) into this, simplified, and found r = -1/53. Then found a = 12/54. Sum of cubes: a³ / (1 - r³) = (12/5)³ / (1 - (-1/5)³) = (1728/125) / (126/125) = 1728/126 = 96/7Yes, that seems correct. I think 96/7 is the right answer.**Final Answer**The sum of the cubes of the terms of the series is boxed{dfrac{96}{7}}."},{"question":"Let ( k ) be an integer greater than 1, and let ( a ) be a root of the equation ( x^{2} - kx + 1 = 0 ). For any natural number ( n ) greater than 10, the units digit of ( a^{2^{n}} + a^{-2^{n}} ) is always 7. What is the units digit of ( k )?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the units digit of ( k ). Let me try to understand the problem step by step.First, the problem says that ( k ) is an integer greater than 1, and ( a ) is a root of the equation ( x^{2} - kx + 1 = 0 ). So, that's a quadratic equation, and ( a ) is one of its roots. Since it's a quadratic with integer coefficients, the other root should be related to ( a ) somehow.Given that ( a ) is a root, I can write the equation as ( a^{2} - ka + 1 = 0 ). Maybe I can solve for ( a ) using the quadratic formula? Let me try that.The quadratic formula gives ( a = frac{k pm sqrt{k^2 - 4}}{2} ). So, ( a ) is either ( frac{k + sqrt{k^2 - 4}}{2} ) or ( frac{k - sqrt{k^2 - 4}}{2} ). Since the problem doesn't specify which root ( a ) is, I might have to consider both possibilities, but maybe it doesn't matter because of some symmetry.Next, the problem states that for any natural number ( n ) greater than 10, the units digit of ( a^{2^{n}} + a^{-2^{n}} ) is always 7. So, no matter how large ( n ) is (as long as it's greater than 10), when we compute ( a^{2^{n}} + a^{-2^{n}} ), the last digit is 7.I need to find the units digit of ( k ). So, perhaps I can find some relationship between ( a ) and ( k ) that will allow me to compute the units digit of ( k ).Let me think about the expression ( a^{2^{n}} + a^{-2^{n}} ). This looks similar to expressions involving powers of roots of quadratics. Maybe I can use some recurrence relation or find a pattern in the units digit.Since ( a ) is a root of ( x^2 - kx + 1 = 0 ), I can express ( a^2 ) in terms of ( a ). From the equation, ( a^2 = ka - 1 ). Similarly, ( a^{-1} ) can be expressed in terms of ( a ) as well. Let me see.If I take the reciprocal of both sides of the equation ( a^2 = ka - 1 ), I get ( a^{-2} = (ka - 1)^{-1} ). Hmm, that might not be straightforward. Maybe instead, I can note that since ( a ) is a root, the other root is ( a^{-1} ) because the product of the roots is 1 (from the equation ( x^2 - kx + 1 = 0 ), the product of the roots is 1). So, if ( a ) is a root, then ( 1/a ) is the other root.Therefore, ( a ) and ( 1/a ) are roots of the equation. So, ( a^{2^{n}} + a^{-2^{n}} ) is actually the sum of the ( 2^{n} )-th powers of the roots. Maybe I can use some properties of recurrence relations here.I remember that for quadratic equations, the sum of powers of roots can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Let me recall that.If ( a ) and ( b ) are roots of ( x^2 - px + q = 0 ), then ( a^n + b^n ) satisfies the recurrence relation ( S_n = p S_{n-1} - q S_{n-2} ), where ( S_n = a^n + b^n ).In our case, the quadratic is ( x^2 - kx + 1 = 0 ), so ( p = k ) and ( q = 1 ). Therefore, the recurrence relation is ( S_n = k S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} ).So, ( S_n = k S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} ). That's useful. Now, ( S_0 = a^0 + a^{-0} = 1 + 1 = 2 ). ( S_1 = a + a^{-1} = k ) because from the equation ( a + a^{-1} = k ).So, ( S_0 = 2 ), ( S_1 = k ), and then for ( n geq 2 ), ( S_n = k S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} ).But in our problem, we are dealing with ( S_{2^n} ). So, ( S_{2^n} = a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ). The problem says that for ( n > 10 ), the units digit of ( S_{2^n} ) is 7.So, the units digit of ( S_{2^n} ) is 7 for all ( n > 10 ). That suggests that the units digit stabilizes to 7 after a certain point. So, perhaps the sequence ( S_{2^n} ) modulo 10 becomes periodic or stabilizes to 7.I need to find the units digit of ( k ). Let me denote ( k ) as some integer greater than 1, and let me denote its units digit as ( d ). So, ( d ) is in {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.I need to find ( d ) such that for all ( n > 10 ), ( S_{2^n} equiv 7 mod 10 ).Given that ( S_n ) satisfies the recurrence ( S_n = k S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} ), perhaps I can compute ( S_{2^n} ) modulo 10 for various ( n ) and see what constraints that imposes on ( k ).But since ( n > 10 ), and ( 2^n ) is a very large exponent, it's impractical to compute directly. So, maybe I can find a pattern or periodicity in ( S_m mod 10 ) as ( m ) increases.Since we're dealing with modulo 10, the possible residues are 0 through 9, so the sequence ( S_m mod 10 ) must eventually become periodic because there are only finitely many possible pairs of consecutive terms.Therefore, perhaps the sequence ( S_{2^n} mod 10 ) will eventually cycle, and since it's given that for all ( n > 10 ), ( S_{2^n} equiv 7 mod 10 ), that suggests that the cycle has period 1, i.e., it's constant at 7.Therefore, the units digit of ( S_{2^n} ) is 7 for all sufficiently large ( n ). So, perhaps the recurrence modulo 10 stabilizes to 7.Let me try to model this.Let me denote ( S_m mod 10 ) as ( s_m ). Then, the recurrence is ( s_m = (k s_{m-1} - s_{m-2}) mod 10 ).Given that ( s_{2^n} = 7 ) for all ( n > 10 ), which implies that for ( m = 2^n ) with ( n > 10 ), ( s_m = 7 ).But ( m = 2^n ) is a power of 2, so the exponents are growing exponentially. So, perhaps the sequence ( s_m ) stabilizes to 7 at exponents that are powers of 2 beyond a certain point.Alternatively, maybe the entire sequence ( s_m ) stabilizes to 7 after a certain point, regardless of the exponent.But I need to figure out what constraints this places on ( k ).Alternatively, perhaps I can compute ( S_{2^n} ) in terms of ( S_{2^{n-1}} ) using the recurrence relation.Wait, let me think about the exponents. ( S_{2^n} ) is ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ). Let me denote ( t_n = S_{2^n} ). So, ( t_n = a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ).I can relate ( t_n ) to ( t_{n-1} ). Let me compute ( t_n ) in terms of ( t_{n-1} ).Since ( t_{n} = a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} = (a^{2^{n-1}})^2 + (a^{-2^{n-1}})^2 ).So, ( t_n = (a^{2^{n-1}})^2 + (a^{-2^{n-1}})^2 ).But ( (a^{2^{n-1}} + a^{-2^{n-1}})^2 = a^{2^n} + 2 + a^{-2^n} ). Therefore, ( t_n = (t_{n-1})^2 - 2 ).So, ( t_n = t_{n-1}^2 - 2 ).That's a useful recursive relation. So, each ( t_n ) is the square of the previous ( t_{n-1} ) minus 2.Given that, and knowing that for ( n > 10 ), ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ), we can write:( t_n equiv (t_{n-1})^2 - 2 mod 10 ).But since ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ), we have:( 7 equiv (t_{n-1})^2 - 2 mod 10 ).So, ( (t_{n-1})^2 equiv 7 + 2 = 9 mod 10 ).Therefore, ( t_{n-1} equiv pm 3 mod 10 ).But since ( t_{n-1} ) is ( a^{2^{n-1}} + a^{-2^{n-1}} ), which is a sum of positive real numbers (assuming ( a ) is positive), so ( t_{n-1} ) is positive. Therefore, ( t_{n-1} equiv 3 mod 10 ) or ( t_{n-1} equiv 7 mod 10 ).Wait, but 3 squared is 9, and 7 squared is 49, which is also 9 mod 10. So, both 3 and 7 square to 9 mod 10.Therefore, if ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-1} equiv 3 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ).But if ( t_{n} equiv 7 mod 10 ) for all ( n > 10 ), then ( t_{n-1} ) must also be such that when squared and subtracted by 2, it gives 7 mod 10. So, as above, ( t_{n-1} equiv 3 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ).But if ( t_{n-1} equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-2} ) must satisfy ( t_{n-1} = t_{n-2}^2 - 2 mod 10 ). So, ( 3 = t_{n-2}^2 - 2 mod 10 ), which implies ( t_{n-2}^2 equiv 5 mod 10 ). But 5 is not a quadratic residue modulo 10, because squares modulo 10 are 0,1,4,5,6,9. Wait, 5 is a quadratic residue modulo 10? Wait, 5 squared is 25, which is 5 mod 10. So, 5 is a quadratic residue mod 10.Wait, let me check:0^2 = 01^2 = 12^2 = 43^2 = 94^2 = 16 ≡ 65^2 = 25 ≡ 56^2 = 36 ≡ 67^2 = 49 ≡ 98^2 = 64 ≡ 49^2 = 81 ≡ 1So, quadratic residues mod 10 are 0,1,4,5,6,9.So, 5 is a quadratic residue mod 10, achieved by 5 and 5.So, if ( t_{n-2}^2 equiv 5 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-2} equiv 5 mod 10 ).So, if ( t_{n-1} equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-2} equiv 5 mod 10 ).Similarly, if ( t_{n-1} equiv 7 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-2}^2 equiv 9 mod 10 ), so ( t_{n-2} equiv 3 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ).So, let's try to see the possible chain of residues.Suppose that for ( n > 10 ), ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ).Then, ( t_{n-1} equiv 3 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ).If ( t_{n-1} equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-2} equiv 5 mod 10 ).If ( t_{n-1} equiv 7 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-2} equiv 3 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ).So, if we have a run of ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ), it could be that ( t_{n-1} equiv 7 mod 10 ), which would require ( t_{n-2} equiv 3 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ).But if ( t_{n-2} equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-3} equiv 5 mod 10 ), and so on.Alternatively, if ( t_{n-2} equiv 7 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-3} equiv 3 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ).This seems like a chain that can go back indefinitely, but in reality, ( n ) is finite, but in our case, ( n > 10 ), so maybe the chain is long enough that it stabilizes.But perhaps another approach is better. Let's think about the recurrence ( t_n = t_{n-1}^2 - 2 mod 10 ).If ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-1} ) must satisfy ( t_{n-1}^2 equiv 9 mod 10 ), so ( t_{n-1} equiv 3 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ).Similarly, if ( t_{n-1} equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-2} ) must satisfy ( t_{n-2}^2 equiv 5 mod 10 ), so ( t_{n-2} equiv 5 mod 10 ).If ( t_{n-2} equiv 5 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-3} ) must satisfy ( t_{n-3}^2 equiv 7 mod 10 ). But 7 is not a quadratic residue modulo 10, as we saw earlier. The quadratic residues mod 10 are 0,1,4,5,6,9. So, 7 is not a quadratic residue mod 10. Therefore, there is no integer ( x ) such that ( x^2 equiv 7 mod 10 ).Therefore, if ( t_{n-2} equiv 5 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-3} ) must satisfy ( t_{n-3}^2 equiv 7 mod 10 ), which is impossible. Therefore, this chain cannot continue indefinitely.This suggests that our assumption that ( t_{n} equiv 7 mod 10 ) for all ( n > 10 ) might require that the chain doesn't reach a point where ( t_{m} equiv 5 mod 10 ), because that would lead to a contradiction.Therefore, perhaps the only way for ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ) for all ( n > 10 ) is if the chain never reaches a point where ( t_{m} equiv 5 mod 10 ). That would require that ( t_{n-1} equiv 7 mod 10 ) for all ( n > 10 ), which would require that ( t_{n-2} equiv 3 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ), but if ( t_{n-2} equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-3} equiv 5 mod 10 ), which is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that ( t_{n-2} equiv 7 mod 10 ), which in turn requires ( t_{n-3} equiv 3 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ), but again, if ( t_{n-3} equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-4} equiv 5 mod 10 ), which is impossible.This seems like a contradiction unless the chain never goes back far enough to hit 5. But since ( n ) can be as large as we want, this suggests that the only way to avoid the contradiction is if the chain doesn't require ( t_{m} equiv 5 mod 10 ) for any ( m ).Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible cycles modulo 10.If I consider the recurrence ( t_n = t_{n-1}^2 - 2 mod 10 ), starting from some initial value, what cycles can we have?Let me try to compute the sequence ( t_n ) modulo 10 for different starting values.Suppose ( t_0 = 2 mod 10 ) (since ( S_0 = 2 )), ( t_1 = k mod 10 ).Then, ( t_2 = t_1^2 - 2 mod 10 ).( t_3 = t_2^2 - 2 mod 10 ).And so on.But in our problem, ( t_n = S_{2^n} ), so ( t_0 = S_1 = k mod 10 ), ( t_1 = S_2 mod 10 ), ( t_2 = S_4 mod 10 ), etc.Wait, maybe I need to clarify the indices.Wait, earlier I defined ( t_n = S_{2^n} ). So, ( t_0 = S_1 = k mod 10 ), ( t_1 = S_2 mod 10 ), ( t_2 = S_4 mod 10 ), ( t_3 = S_8 mod 10 ), etc.So, the recurrence is ( t_n = t_{n-1}^2 - 2 mod 10 ).Given that, and that for ( n > 10 ), ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ), we can think of this as the sequence ( t_n ) entering a fixed point at 7 after a certain number of steps.So, if ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ) for all ( n > 10 ), then ( t_{n} = t_{n-1}^2 - 2 mod 10 ) must hold, meaning that 7 must satisfy the equation ( 7 = 7^2 - 2 mod 10 ).Let me check that:( 7^2 = 49 ), so ( 49 - 2 = 47 ), and ( 47 mod 10 = 7 ). So yes, 7 is a fixed point of the recurrence modulo 10.Therefore, once the sequence reaches 7, it stays at 7. So, the problem states that for all ( n > 10 ), ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ). So, the sequence must have reached 7 by ( n = 11 ), and stays there.Therefore, to find ( k ), we need to find the units digit ( d ) such that starting from ( t_0 = d ), the sequence ( t_n ) reaches 7 by ( n = 11 ) and stays there.So, perhaps I can compute the sequence ( t_n ) modulo 10 starting from ( t_0 = d ), and see for which ( d ) the sequence reaches 7 and stays there.Let me try this approach.First, let's note that ( t_0 = d mod 10 ), ( t_1 = d^2 - 2 mod 10 ), ( t_2 = (t_1)^2 - 2 mod 10 ), and so on.We need to find ( d ) such that after 11 iterations, ( t_{11} equiv 7 mod 10 ), and since 7 is a fixed point, all subsequent ( t_n ) will be 7.But since the problem says that for all ( n > 10 ), ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ), that means that ( t_{11} equiv 7 mod 10 ), and ( t_{12} equiv 7 mod 10 ), etc.Therefore, we need to find ( d ) such that starting from ( t_0 = d ), the sequence ( t_n ) reaches 7 by ( n = 11 ).Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient that the sequence eventually reaches 7, but given the problem statement, it must reach 7 by ( n = 11 ).But maybe it's better to see what possible ( d ) can lead to 7 after some iterations.Let me consider all possible units digits ( d ) from 0 to 9, and compute the sequence ( t_n ) modulo 10 for each ( d ), and see which ones eventually reach 7.But since ( k ) is greater than 1, ( d ) can be 2 through 9.Let me list the possible ( d ) values: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.For each ( d ), I'll compute ( t_0 = d ), ( t_1 = d^2 - 2 mod 10 ), ( t_2 = t_1^2 - 2 mod 10 ), and so on, up to ( t_{11} ), and see if ( t_{11} equiv 7 mod 10 ).Alternatively, maybe I can find cycles or fixed points.We already know that 7 is a fixed point.Let me compute the sequence for each ( d ):1. ( d = 2 ):   - ( t_0 = 2 )   - ( t_1 = 2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 mod 10 )   - ( t_2 = 2^2 - 2 = 2 mod 10 )   - So, it's stuck in a loop of 2. Never reaches 7.2. ( d = 3 ):   - ( t_0 = 3 )   - ( t_1 = 3^2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 mod 10 )   - ( t_2 = 7^2 - 2 = 49 - 2 = 47 ≡ 7 mod 10 )   - So, it reaches 7 at ( t_1 ) and stays there. So, for ( d = 3 ), ( t_n = 7 ) for ( n geq 1 ).3. ( d = 4 ):   - ( t_0 = 4 )   - ( t_1 = 4^2 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14 ≡ 4 mod 10 )   - ( t_2 = 4^2 - 2 = 14 ≡ 4 mod 10 )   - So, stuck in a loop of 4. Never reaches 7.4. ( d = 5 ):   - ( t_0 = 5 )   - ( t_1 = 5^2 - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 ≡ 3 mod 10 )   - ( t_2 = 3^2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 mod 10 )   - ( t_3 = 7^2 - 2 = 47 ≡ 7 mod 10 )   - So, reaches 7 at ( t_2 ).5. ( d = 6 ):   - ( t_0 = 6 )   - ( t_1 = 6^2 - 2 = 36 - 2 = 34 ≡ 4 mod 10 )   - ( t_2 = 4^2 - 2 = 14 ≡ 4 mod 10 )   - Stuck in loop of 4. Never reaches 7.6. ( d = 7 ):   - ( t_0 = 7 )   - ( t_1 = 7^2 - 2 = 47 ≡ 7 mod 10 )   - So, already at 7 and stays there.7. ( d = 8 ):   - ( t_0 = 8 )   - ( t_1 = 8^2 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62 ≡ 2 mod 10 )   - ( t_2 = 2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 mod 10 )   - Stuck in loop of 2. Never reaches 7.8. ( d = 9 ):   - ( t_0 = 9 )   - ( t_1 = 9^2 - 2 = 81 - 2 = 79 ≡ 9 mod 10 )   - So, stuck in loop of 9. Never reaches 7.So, from the above, the only ( d ) values that eventually reach 7 are ( d = 3 ), ( d = 5 ), and ( d = 7 ).But wait, for ( d = 5 ), it reaches 7 at ( t_2 ), which is ( n = 2 ). But the problem states that for ( n > 10 ), ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ). So, as long as the sequence reaches 7 by ( n = 11 ), it's fine. So, ( d = 5 ) would reach 7 by ( n = 2 ), which is way before ( n = 11 ), so that's acceptable.Similarly, ( d = 3 ) reaches 7 at ( n = 1 ), which is also before ( n = 11 ).( d = 7 ) is already at 7.So, the possible units digits ( d ) are 3, 5, 7.But wait, the problem says that ( k ) is an integer greater than 1, so ( d ) can be 3, 5, 7, or other digits, but from our analysis, only 3,5,7 lead to ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ) for ( n > 10 ).But let me think again. The problem states that for any natural number ( n ) greater than 10, the units digit is 7. So, it's not that the sequence must reach 7 by ( n = 11 ), but that for all ( n > 10 ), ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ). So, if the sequence reaches 7 before ( n = 11 ), that's fine because for ( n > 10 ), it's already 7.But wait, in our earlier analysis, for ( d = 3 ), ( t_1 = 7 ), so for all ( n geq 1 ), ( t_n = 7 ). So, for ( n > 10 ), it's 7. Similarly, for ( d = 5 ), ( t_2 = 7 ), so for ( n geq 2 ), ( t_n = 7 ). For ( d = 7 ), it's already 7.But what about other ( d ) values? For example, ( d = 1 ). Wait, ( k ) is greater than 1, so ( d ) can't be 1.Wait, let me check ( d = 5 ) again. When ( d = 5 ), ( t_1 = 5^2 - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 ≡ 3 mod 10 ). Then, ( t_2 = 3^2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 mod 10 ). So, ( t_2 = 7 ), and then it stays at 7. So, for ( n geq 2 ), ( t_n = 7 ). Therefore, for ( n > 10 ), it's 7.Similarly, ( d = 3 ) reaches 7 at ( n = 1 ).But wait, the problem says that for any natural number ( n ) greater than 10, the units digit is 7. So, as long as by ( n = 11 ), ( t_{11} = 7 ), it's fine.But in our analysis, ( d = 3 ) and ( d = 5 ) reach 7 before ( n = 11 ), so they satisfy the condition.But wait, let me check ( d = 5 ). Let me compute the sequence up to ( n = 11 ):- ( t_0 = 5 )- ( t_1 = 5^2 - 2 = 23 ≡ 3 mod 10 )- ( t_2 = 3^2 - 2 = 7 mod 10 )- ( t_3 = 7^2 - 2 = 47 ≡ 7 mod 10 )- ( t_4 = 7 )- ...- All subsequent ( t_n = 7 mod 10 )So, yes, by ( n = 2 ), it's 7, so for ( n > 10 ), it's 7.Similarly, ( d = 3 ):- ( t_0 = 3 )- ( t_1 = 7 mod 10 )- ( t_2 = 7 mod 10 )- ...- So, by ( n = 1 ), it's 7.But wait, the problem says \\"for any natural number ( n ) greater than 10\\", so as long as ( t_n = 7 ) for ( n > 10 ), it's acceptable, regardless of what happens for smaller ( n ).Therefore, ( d = 3 ), ( d = 5 ), and ( d = 7 ) all satisfy the condition.But the problem asks for the units digit of ( k ). So, are there multiple possible answers? Or is there only one?Wait, let me check if ( d = 5 ) is possible.If ( d = 5 ), then ( k equiv 5 mod 10 ). Let me check if that leads to ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ) for ( n > 10 ).From earlier, yes, it does. So, ( d = 5 ) is possible.Similarly, ( d = 3 ) and ( d = 7 ) are possible.But wait, let me think about the original quadratic equation. ( a ) is a root of ( x^2 - kx + 1 = 0 ). So, ( a ) and ( 1/a ) are roots.Therefore, ( a + 1/a = k ), and ( a cdot 1/a = 1 ).So, ( a ) is either greater than 1 or between 0 and 1, depending on ( k ).But regardless, ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ) is always a positive integer, as it's the sum of a number and its reciprocal raised to a power.But wait, is ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ) necessarily an integer? Because ( a ) is a root of a quadratic with integer coefficients, so ( a ) is either rational or irrational. If ( k^2 - 4 ) is a perfect square, then ( a ) is rational; otherwise, it's irrational.But in either case, ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ) is an integer because of the recurrence relation. Since ( S_n ) is defined as ( a^n + a^{-n} ), and the recurrence ( S_n = k S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} ) with integer coefficients, so all ( S_n ) are integers.Therefore, ( t_n = S_{2^n} ) is an integer, so its units digit is well-defined.But going back, we have that ( d ) can be 3, 5, or 7.But the problem asks for the units digit of ( k ). So, is there only one possible digit, or multiple?Wait, let me think about the original recurrence.If ( k equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( t_0 = 3 ), ( t_1 = 7 ), and so on.If ( k equiv 5 mod 10 ), then ( t_0 = 5 ), ( t_1 = 3 ), ( t_2 = 7 ), etc.If ( k equiv 7 mod 10 ), then ( t_0 = 7 ), and it stays there.But the problem states that for any ( n > 10 ), the units digit is 7. So, all three cases satisfy this condition.But the problem says \\"the units digit of ( k )\\", implying a unique answer. So, perhaps I made a mistake in considering all three digits as possible.Wait, maybe I need to consider the behavior of the recurrence more carefully.Let me think about the quadratic equation ( x^2 - kx + 1 = 0 ). The roots are ( a ) and ( 1/a ). So, ( a ) is either greater than 1 or less than 1.If ( a > 1 ), then ( a^{2^n} ) grows exponentially, and ( a^{-2^n} ) approaches 0. So, ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ) is approximately ( a^{2^n} ), which is a large number.Similarly, if ( 0 < a < 1 ), then ( a^{2^n} ) approaches 0, and ( a^{-2^n} ) grows exponentially.But in either case, ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ) is an integer, as we saw earlier.But the units digit is 7 for all ( n > 10 ). So, regardless of whether ( a ) is greater than 1 or less than 1, the units digit stabilizes to 7.But perhaps the value of ( k ) affects the behavior of the recurrence.Wait, let me think about the possible values of ( k ).If ( k equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( k ) could be 3, 13, 23, etc.Similarly, ( k equiv 5 mod 10 ) could be 5, 15, 25, etc.And ( k equiv 7 mod 10 ) could be 7, 17, 27, etc.But perhaps the actual value of ( k ) is constrained by the requirement that ( a ) is a root of the quadratic equation, and that ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ) has units digit 7 for all ( n > 10 ).But I'm not sure how to narrow it down further.Wait, maybe I can consider the minimal case where ( k ) is minimal, i.e., ( k = 3 ), ( k = 5 ), or ( k = 7 ), and see if they satisfy the condition.Let me test ( k = 3 ):Quadratic equation: ( x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0 ). Roots are ( a = frac{3 pm sqrt{5}}{2} ).Compute ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ). Let's compute ( S_1 = 3 ), ( S_2 = 3*3 - 2 = 7 ), ( S_4 = 7^2 - 2 = 47 ), ( S_8 = 47^2 - 2 = 2207 ), etc. So, the units digit of ( S_{2^n} ) is 7 for ( n geq 1 ). So, for ( n > 10 ), it's 7.Similarly, for ( k = 5 ):Quadratic equation: ( x^2 - 5x + 1 = 0 ). Roots are ( a = frac{5 pm sqrt{21}}{2} ).Compute ( S_1 = 5 ), ( S_2 = 5*5 - 2 = 23 ), ( S_4 = 23^2 - 2 = 527 ), ( S_8 = 527^2 - 2 ), which ends with 7^2 - 2 = 49 - 2 = 47, so units digit 7. Then ( S_{16} ) would be 7^2 - 2 = 47, units digit 7, and so on. So, for ( n geq 2 ), ( S_{2^n} ) has units digit 7.For ( k = 7 ):Quadratic equation: ( x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0 ). Roots are ( a = frac{7 pm sqrt{45}}{2} = frac{7 pm 3sqrt{5}}{2} ).Compute ( S_1 = 7 ), ( S_2 = 7*7 - 2 = 47 ), ( S_4 = 47^2 - 2 = 2207 ), which ends with 7, and so on. So, units digit is 7 for all ( n geq 1 ).So, all three values ( k = 3 ), ( k = 5 ), ( k = 7 ) satisfy the condition that ( S_{2^n} ) has units digit 7 for ( n > 10 ).But the problem asks for the units digit of ( k ). So, the units digit could be 3, 5, or 7. But the problem states \\"the units digit of ( k )\\", implying a unique answer. So, perhaps I'm missing something.Wait, maybe I need to consider the minimal ( k ) that satisfies the condition. The minimal ( k ) greater than 1 is 3, but the problem doesn't specify minimal, just that ( k ) is greater than 1.Alternatively, perhaps the units digit must be 7 because ( k ) itself must be such that ( t_0 = k mod 10 ) leads to 7 after some steps, but in our earlier analysis, ( d = 3 ), ( d = 5 ), and ( d = 7 ) all lead to 7.But the problem says \\"the units digit of ( k )\\", so perhaps all three are possible, but the problem expects a single answer. Maybe I need to look back at the problem statement.Wait, the problem says \\"the units digit of ( a^{2^{n}} + a^{-2^{n}} ) is always 7\\". So, it's always 7 for any ( n > 10 ). So, regardless of ( k ), as long as the units digit of ( k ) is 3, 5, or 7, the condition is satisfied.But the problem is asking for the units digit of ( k ). So, is it possible that only one of these digits is possible?Wait, perhaps I need to consider the behavior of the recurrence more carefully. Let me think about the Pisano period or something similar, but modulo 10.Wait, the recurrence ( S_n = k S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} ) modulo 10. The Pisano period is for Fibonacci-like sequences, but this is a different recurrence.Alternatively, perhaps the period of ( S_n mod 10 ) is finite, so the sequence must eventually cycle. But in our case, the sequence ( t_n = S_{2^n} mod 10 ) is given to be 7 for all ( n > 10 ). So, perhaps the only way this can happen is if ( t_n ) is in a cycle of length 1, i.e., fixed at 7.But as we saw earlier, 7 is a fixed point, so once the sequence reaches 7, it stays there.But for ( d = 3 ), the sequence reaches 7 at ( n = 1 ), so ( t_n = 7 ) for all ( n geq 1 ).For ( d = 5 ), it reaches 7 at ( n = 2 ).For ( d = 7 ), it's already at 7.So, all three are possible.But the problem is asking for the units digit of ( k ). So, perhaps the answer is that the units digit is 7, because if ( k equiv 7 mod 10 ), then ( t_0 = 7 ), and the sequence stays at 7.But why would the units digit be 7? Because if ( k equiv 3 ) or ( 5 mod 10 ), the sequence still reaches 7.Wait, maybe I need to consider the original recurrence ( S_n = k S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} ). If ( k equiv 3 mod 10 ), then the recurrence modulo 10 is ( S_n = 3 S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} mod 10 ). Similarly for ( k equiv 5 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ).But in our earlier analysis, regardless of ( k mod 10 ), as long as it's 3,5,7, the sequence ( t_n ) reaches 7 and stays there.But perhaps the problem is designed such that ( k ) must be 3, 5, or 7, but the units digit is unique. Wait, no, 3,5,7 are different digits.Wait, maybe I need to consider that ( a ) is a root, and ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ) is an integer, but also, the units digit is 7. So, perhaps the minimal ( k ) is 3, but the problem doesn't specify minimal.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.Suppose that ( k equiv 3 mod 10 ). Then, ( t_0 = 3 ), ( t_1 = 7 ), and so on. So, the units digit of ( k ) is 3.Similarly, if ( k equiv 5 mod 10 ), the units digit is 5.If ( k equiv 7 mod 10 ), the units digit is 7.But the problem states that for any ( n > 10 ), the units digit is 7. So, all three cases satisfy this.But the problem is asking for the units digit of ( k ). So, unless there's more constraints, all three are possible. But the problem is likely expecting a single answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in considering all three.Wait, let me think about the quadratic equation again. If ( k equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( k = 10m + 3 ). Similarly for 5 and 7.But perhaps the actual value of ( k ) is such that ( a ) is the golden ratio or something similar, but I don't think that's relevant here.Wait, another approach: since ( a ) is a root of ( x^2 - kx + 1 = 0 ), then ( a ) satisfies ( a + 1/a = k ). So, ( a ) is either ( frac{k + sqrt{k^2 - 4}}{2} ) or ( frac{k - sqrt{k^2 - 4}}{2} ).But regardless, ( a ) is either greater than 1 or less than 1, as I thought earlier.But perhaps the value of ( a ) affects the units digit of ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ). But since we've already established that the recurrence modulo 10 leads to 7 for ( d = 3,5,7 ), maybe all three are possible.But the problem is asking for the units digit of ( k ). So, perhaps the answer is that the units digit is 7, because if ( k equiv 7 mod 10 ), then ( t_0 = 7 ), and it stays there. Whereas for ( d = 3 ) or ( 5 ), the sequence reaches 7 after some steps. But the problem says \\"for any natural number ( n ) greater than 10\\", so as long as it's 7 for ( n > 10 ), it's acceptable.But the problem is likely designed to have a unique answer, so perhaps I'm missing a constraint.Wait, let me think about the minimal ( k ). The minimal ( k ) greater than 1 is 3, but let's see:For ( k = 3 ), the sequence ( t_n ) is 3,7,7,7,... So, for ( n > 10 ), it's 7.For ( k = 5 ), the sequence is 5,3,7,7,7,... So, for ( n > 10 ), it's 7.For ( k = 7 ), the sequence is 7,7,7,... So, for ( n > 10 ), it's 7.So, all three satisfy the condition. Therefore, the units digit of ( k ) could be 3,5, or 7.But the problem is asking for \\"the units digit of ( k )\\", implying a unique answer. So, perhaps I need to consider that the units digit must be 7 because ( k ) itself must satisfy ( k equiv 7 mod 10 ) to have ( t_0 = 7 ).But no, because even if ( k equiv 3 mod 10 ), the sequence reaches 7 quickly.Wait, maybe the problem is designed such that the units digit of ( k ) must be 7 because ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} ) is always 7, implying that ( k ) itself must be 7 mod 10.But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 7 because it's the only digit where ( t_0 = 7 ), so the sequence is already at 7.But the problem doesn't specify that ( k ) must be minimal or anything, so I think all three are possible. But since the problem is asking for the units digit, and it's a single answer, perhaps the answer is 7.Wait, let me check the problem statement again: \\"the units digit of ( a^{2^{n}} + a^{-2^{n}} ) is always 7\\". So, regardless of ( k ), as long as the units digit of ( k ) is 3,5, or 7, the condition is satisfied.But the problem is asking for the units digit of ( k ). So, unless there's a unique answer, I think the answer is 7.Wait, but why? Because if ( k equiv 7 mod 10 ), then ( t_0 = 7 ), and the sequence stays there. Whereas for ( k equiv 3 ) or ( 5 mod 10 ), the sequence reaches 7 after some steps.But the problem says \\"for any natural number ( n ) greater than 10\\", so as long as it's 7 for ( n > 10 ), it's acceptable. So, all three are acceptable.But the problem is likely expecting a unique answer, so perhaps I'm missing a constraint.Wait, let me think about the quadratic equation again. If ( k equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( k = 10m + 3 ). Then, ( a + 1/a = 10m + 3 ). So, ( a ) is a root of ( x^2 - (10m + 3)x + 1 = 0 ). Similarly for ( k equiv 5 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ).But perhaps the units digit of ( k ) is uniquely determined by the fact that ( a^{2^n} + a^{-2^n} equiv 7 mod 10 ) for all ( n > 10 ). So, maybe only one of the digits 3,5,7 works.Wait, let me think about the recurrence ( t_n = t_{n-1}^2 - 2 mod 10 ). If ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-1} equiv 3 ) or ( 7 mod 10 ). So, if ( t_{n-1} equiv 3 mod 10 ), then ( t_{n-2} equiv 5 mod 10 ), which is impossible because ( t_{n-2} ) must be an integer, but 5 squared is 25, which is 5 mod 10, but then ( t_{n-3} ) would have to satisfy ( t_{n-3}^2 equiv 7 mod 10 ), which is impossible.Therefore, the only way for ( t_n equiv 7 mod 10 ) for all ( n > 10 ) is if ( t_{n-1} equiv 7 mod 10 ) for all ( n > 10 ), which implies that ( t_{n-2} equiv 7 mod 10 ), and so on. Therefore, the only way to avoid the contradiction is if the sequence never reaches a point where ( t_m equiv 5 mod 10 ). Therefore, the only way is if the sequence is already at 7, meaning ( t_0 = 7 mod 10 ).Therefore, ( k equiv 7 mod 10 ).So, the units digit of ( k ) is 7.**Final Answer**The units digit of ( k ) is boxed{7}."},{"question":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms is denoted as S_n. If S_{12}=21, then find the value of a_{2}+a_{5}+a_{8}+a_{11}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to remember what I know about arithmetic sequences. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, if the first term is ( a_1 ) and the common difference is ( d ), then the nth term ( a_n ) can be written as ( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d ). The problem says that the sum of the first ( n ) terms is denoted as ( S_n ). I remember that the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) terms of an arithmetic sequence is ( S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) ) or alternatively ( S_n = frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d] ). Both formulas are equivalent because ( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d ).Given that ( S_{12} = 21 ), I need to find the value of ( a_2 + a_5 + a_8 + a_{11} ). Hmm, okay. So, first, let me write down what I know.First, let's express ( S_{12} ) using the sum formula. Using the first formula, ( S_{12} = frac{12}{2}(a_1 + a_{12}) = 6(a_1 + a_{12}) ). We know this equals 21, so:( 6(a_1 + a_{12}) = 21 )Divide both sides by 6:( a_1 + a_{12} = frac{21}{6} = frac{7}{2} = 3.5 )Alternatively, using the second formula:( S_{12} = frac{12}{2}[2a_1 + 11d] = 6(2a_1 + 11d) = 12a_1 + 66d = 21 )So, ( 12a_1 + 66d = 21 ). Maybe I can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 3:( 4a_1 + 22d = 7 )Hmm, that might be useful later.Now, I need to find ( a_2 + a_5 + a_8 + a_{11} ). Let me write each of these terms in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( d ):- ( a_2 = a_1 + d )- ( a_5 = a_1 + 4d )- ( a_8 = a_1 + 7d )- ( a_{11} = a_1 + 10d )So, adding them together:( a_2 + a_5 + a_8 + a_{11} = (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 4d) + (a_1 + 7d) + (a_1 + 10d) )Combine like terms:( = 4a_1 + (d + 4d + 7d + 10d) )( = 4a_1 + 22d )Wait a second, that's the same expression I had earlier from simplifying ( S_{12} )! So, ( 4a_1 + 22d = 7 ). Therefore, ( a_2 + a_5 + a_8 + a_{11} = 7 ).Alternatively, let me think if there's another way to approach this without going through the algebra. Since the terms ( a_2, a_5, a_8, a_{11} ) are equally spaced in the sequence, each separated by 3 terms. So, they form another arithmetic sequence themselves with a common difference of ( 3d ). Let me check that. The difference between ( a_5 ) and ( a_2 ) is ( (a_1 + 4d) - (a_1 + d) = 3d ). Similarly, between ( a_8 ) and ( a_5 ) is ( 3d ), and so on. So, yes, they form an arithmetic sequence with 4 terms, first term ( a_2 ), and common difference ( 3d ).The sum of these four terms can be calculated using the sum formula for an arithmetic sequence as well. The sum ( S ) is:( S = frac{4}{2}[2a_2 + (4 - 1)(3d)] = 2[2a_2 + 9d] = 4a_2 + 18d )But wait, that doesn't seem to match what I had earlier. Let me compute ( a_2 + a_5 + a_8 + a_{11} ) another way. Alternatively, since these four terms are equally spaced, their average is equal to the average of the first and last terms. So, the average is ( frac{a_2 + a_{11}}{2} ), and since there are four terms, the sum is ( 4 times frac{a_2 + a_{11}}{2} = 2(a_2 + a_{11}) ).But ( a_2 + a_{11} = (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 10d) = 2a_1 + 11d ). So, the sum is ( 2(2a_1 + 11d) = 4a_1 + 22d ), which is the same as before. So, that's consistent.From earlier, we had ( 4a_1 + 22d = 7 ), so the sum is 7. So, that's the answer.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. So, starting from ( S_{12} = 21 ), which gives ( 12a_1 + 66d = 21 ), simplifying to ( 4a_1 + 22d = 7 ). Then, the sum ( a_2 + a_5 + a_8 + a_{11} ) is also ( 4a_1 + 22d ), so it's equal to 7. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the positions of these terms. The terms ( a_2, a_5, a_8, a_{11} ) are at positions 2, 5, 8, 11. These are 4 terms, each 3 apart. So, in terms of the original sequence, they are like every 3rd term starting from the 2nd term.Another way to think about it: The average of these four terms is equal to the average of the entire 12-term sequence? Wait, no, that might not be the case. The average of the entire 12-term sequence is ( frac{S_{12}}{12} = frac{21}{12} = frac{7}{4} = 1.75 ). But the average of ( a_2, a_5, a_8, a_{11} ) is ( frac{7}{4} ) as well? Wait, no, because the sum is 7, so the average is ( frac{7}{4} = 1.75 ). So, actually, the average of these four terms is the same as the average of the entire 12-term sequence. That makes sense because these four terms are equally spaced, so their average should be the same as the overall average.So, that's another way to see it. Since the average of the four terms is equal to the overall average, which is ( frac{7}{4} ), then the sum is ( 4 times frac{7}{4} = 7 ). So, that's another way to get the answer without going through all the algebra.But let me double-check my initial algebra. I had ( S_{12} = 21 ), which is ( 6(a_1 + a_{12}) = 21 ), so ( a_1 + a_{12} = 3.5 ). Then, ( a_2 + a_5 + a_8 + a_{11} = 4a_1 + 22d ). But since ( a_{12} = a_1 + 11d ), so ( a_1 + a_{12} = 2a_1 + 11d = 3.5 ). Therefore, ( 2a_1 + 11d = 3.5 ). Then, multiplying both sides by 2, we get ( 4a_1 + 22d = 7 ), which is exactly the sum we're looking for. So, that's consistent.Therefore, I'm confident that the value of ( a_2 + a_5 + a_8 + a_{11} ) is 7.**Final Answer**The value of ( a_{2} + a_{5} + a_{8} + a_{11} ) is boxed{7}."},{"question":"Fröken Bock and Karlsson together weigh 120 kg more than the Kid, and Karlsson and the Kid weigh 60 kg more than Fröken Bock. How much does Karlsson weigh? Give the answer in kilograms.","answer":"First, I'll define variables for the weights of Fröken Bock, Karlsson, and the Kid. Let F represent Fröken Bock's weight, K represent Karlsson's weight, and D represent the Kid's weight.From the problem, I know two key pieces of information:1. Fröken Bock and Karlsson together weigh 120 kg more than the Kid. This can be written as F + K = D + 120.2. Karlsson and the Kid together weigh 60 kg more than Fröken Bock. This can be written as K + D = F + 60.Next, I'll solve these equations step by step. Starting with the first equation, I'll express D in terms of F and K: D = F + K - 120.Then, I'll substitute this expression for D into the second equation: K + (F + K - 120) = F + 60.Simplifying this, I get 2K - 120 = 60.

This means that the width and height must increase by the same scale factor.The original width of the logo is 2 inches, and the desired width is 8 inches. To find the scale factor, I divide the new width by the original width: 8 inches divided by 2 inches equals 4. So, the scale factor is 4.Next, I apply this scale factor to the original height of the logo. The original height is 1.5 inches.

There are three parts to this problem, and I need to tackle each one step by step. Let me start with part (I).**Problem (I): How many ways are there to select 2 boys and 2 girls?**Alright, so I need to choose 2 boys out of 5 and 2 girls out of 4. I remember that when selecting a certain number of items from a larger set without considering the order, we use combinations. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items we want to choose.First, let me calculate the number of ways to choose 2 boys from 5. That would be C(5, 2). Plugging into the formula:C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 × 4 × 3!) / (2 × 1 × 3!) = (20) / 2 = 10.So, there are 10 ways to choose 2 boys.Next, I need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4. That would be C(4, 2).C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4 - 2)!) = (4 × 3 × 2!) / (2 × 1 × 2!) = (12) / 4 = 3. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate.Wait, 4! is 24, and 2! is 2, so 24 / (2 × 2!) = 24 / (2 × 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, C(4, 2) is 6. Okay, that makes more sense because I know that C(4, 2) is 6.So, the number of ways to choose 2 girls is 6.Now, since these are independent choices (choosing boys and choosing girls), I need to multiply the two results together to get the total number of ways to select 2 boys and 2 girls.Total ways = C(5, 2) × C(4, 2) = 10 × 6 = 60.So, for part (I), the answer should be 60 ways.**Problem (II): How many ways are there to select the group such that at least one of the boys (named A) or one of the girls (named B) is included?**Hmm, okay, so this is a bit more complex. I need to count the number of groups where either boy A is included, or girl B is included, or both. The phrase \\"at least one\\" usually suggests that we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.First, let me understand the total number of possible groups without any restrictions. Since there are 5 boys and 4 girls, making a total of 9 people, the total number of ways to choose 4 people is C(9, 4).Calculating that: C(9, 4) = 9! / (4!5!) = (9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 126. So, there are 126 total possible groups.Now, the problem is asking for the number of groups that include at least one of boy A or girl B. To find this, it's often easier to calculate the total number of groups minus the number of groups that exclude both boy A and girl B.So, the number of groups that exclude both A and B would be the number of ways to choose 4 people from the remaining boys and girls. Since we're excluding A and B, we have 4 boys left (since there were 5 boys originally, excluding A) and 3 girls left (since there were 4 girls originally, excluding B). So, total people left are 4 + 3 = 7.Therefore, the number of groups excluding both A and B is C(7, 4). Let's compute that:C(7, 4) = 7! / (4!3!) = (7 × 6 × 5 × 4) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 35.So, the number of groups that include at least one of A or B is total groups minus groups excluding both:126 - 35 = 91.Wait, let me verify that. So, total groups: 126. Groups without A and B: 35. So, 126 - 35 = 91. That seems correct.Alternatively, I could have calculated it using inclusion-exclusion. Let me try that method as a check.Number of groups with A: To include A, we need to choose 3 more people from the remaining 8 (since A is already included). So, C(8, 3).Similarly, number of groups with B: To include B, we need to choose 3 more people from the remaining 8 (since B is already included). So, C(8, 3).But wait, if I add these two, I might be double-counting the groups that include both A and B. So, I need to subtract the number of groups that include both A and B.Number of groups with both A and B: We include both A and B, so we need to choose 2 more people from the remaining 7 (since A and B are already included). So, C(7, 2).Therefore, using inclusion-exclusion:Number of groups with A or B = (C(8, 3) + C(8, 3) - C(7, 2)).Calculating each term:C(8, 3) = 56.C(7, 2) = 21.So, 56 + 56 - 21 = 91.Yes, same result. So, that confirms that the number is 91.Therefore, the answer for part (II) is 91 ways.**Problem (III): How many ways are there to select the group such that it must contain both boys and girls?**Alright, so this time, we need to ensure that the group has at least one boy and at least one girl. So, the group can't be all boys or all girls.First, let me compute the total number of possible groups, which we already know is 126.Now, let's compute the number of groups that are all boys and the number of groups that are all girls, and subtract both from the total.Number of all-boy groups: Since there are 5 boys, the number of ways to choose 4 boys is C(5, 4).C(5, 4) = 5.Number of all-girl groups: There are 4 girls, so the number of ways to choose 4 girls is C(4, 4) = 1.Therefore, the number of groups that are all boys or all girls is 5 + 1 = 6.Hence, the number of groups that contain both boys and girls is total groups minus all-boy and all-girl groups:126 - 6 = 120.Wait, let me check that.Total groups: 126.All boys: C(5,4)=5.All girls: C(4,4)=1.So, 126 - 5 -1 = 120.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, I can compute it directly by considering the possible distributions of boys and girls in the group.Since the group must have both boys and girls, the possible compositions are:- 1 boy and 3 girls- 2 boys and 2 girls- 3 boys and 1 girlSo, let's compute each case and sum them up.1. 1 boy and 3 girls:C(5,1) × C(4,3) = 5 × 4 = 20.2. 2 boys and 2 girls:C(5,2) × C(4,2) = 10 × 6 = 60.3. 3 boys and 1 girl:C(5,3) × C(4,1) = 10 × 4 = 40.Adding them up: 20 + 60 + 40 = 120.Same result. So, that's consistent.Therefore, the answer for part (III) is 120 ways.**Summary of Answers:**(I) 60 ways.(II) 91 ways.(III) 120 ways.**Final Answer**(I) boxed{60}(II) boxed{91}(III) boxed{120}"},{"question":"In a certain country, there are 100 cities connected by a road network in such a way that one can travel from any city to any other by only one route without turning back. The road network's layout is known, intersections and junctions need not be cities, and any dead-end section of the network necessarily ends in a city. A navigator can measure the distance along this network between any two cities. Is it possible to determine the total length of the entire road network with 100 such measurements?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about 100 cities connected by roads in a way that you can travel from any city to any other city by only one route without turning back. That sounds like a tree structure because in a tree, there's exactly one path between any two nodes, which in this case are cities. So, the road network is a tree with 100 nodes.The question is asking if it's possible to determine the total length of the entire road network by making 100 measurements. Each measurement is the distance between two cities along the network. So, essentially, can we figure out the sum of all the edge lengths in this tree by measuring 100 distances between pairs of cities?First, let me recall some properties of trees. A tree with n nodes has n-1 edges. So, in this case, there are 99 edges. Each edge has a certain length, and the total length of the network is the sum of all these 99 edge lengths.Now, each distance measurement between two cities gives us the sum of the lengths of the edges along the unique path connecting those two cities. So, each measurement is essentially a sum of some subset of the 99 edges.If we can set up a system of equations where each equation corresponds to a distance measurement, and each variable corresponds to an edge length, then solving this system would give us the lengths of all edges, and hence the total length.But how many equations do we need? Since there are 99 variables (edge lengths), we need at least 99 independent equations to solve for them uniquely. However, the problem allows us to make 100 measurements, which is more than 99. So, in theory, if we can choose the right pairs of cities to measure, we can get enough information to determine all edge lengths.But wait, in practice, how do we ensure that the measurements are independent? Each measurement corresponds to a path, and if the paths are chosen such that each new measurement adds a new independent equation, then we can solve for all edges.One approach is to perform measurements along all the edges. But since we don't know the edges in advance, we can't directly measure them. Instead, we can use the concept of a spanning tree and perform measurements that correspond to the edges in a way that allows us to deduce each edge's length.Another idea is to use the concept of a basis in linear algebra. Each edge can be considered a vector, and each measurement is a linear combination of these vectors. If we can find a set of measurements that form a basis for the space of edge lengths, then we can solve for each edge.But perhaps a simpler approach is to consider that in a tree, the distance between two nodes can be expressed as the sum of the distances from each node to their lowest common ancestor. So, if we can measure distances in such a way that we can triangulate each edge's length, we can sum them up.Alternatively, we can think about using the distances to reconstruct the tree. There's a concept in graph theory called the \\"distance matrix,\\" which contains the distances between all pairs of nodes. From the distance matrix, it's possible to reconstruct the tree, especially if it's a tree (which is a special case). However, reconstructing the entire distance matrix would require n(n-1)/2 measurements, which is 4950 for 100 cities, which is way more than 100. So, that's not the way to go.But maybe we don't need the entire distance matrix. Since the tree has only 99 edges, perhaps we can find a way to measure distances that cover all edges and allow us to solve for each edge's length.One method is to perform measurements along a set of paths that form a basis for the tree. For example, if we can measure the distances along all the edges in a spanning tree, but again, we don't know the edges. So, perhaps we can use a different strategy.Another approach is to use the concept of additive distances. In a tree, the distances satisfy the additive property, meaning that for any three nodes, the distance between two of them is less than or equal to the sum of the distances to the third. This property can help in reconstructing the tree.But how does this help in determining the total length? Maybe if we can find a way to express the total length as a combination of certain distances. For example, if we can find a set of distances whose sum equals twice the total length (since each edge is counted twice in the sum of all pairs), but that might not be directly helpful.Wait, actually, if we consider all pairs of cities, the sum of all pairwise distances would be equal to twice the sum of the lengths of all edges multiplied by the number of times each edge appears in all paths. But that seems complicated.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in a tree, the number of times an edge is used in all pairs is equal to the product of the number of nodes on each side of the edge. So, if we have an edge that splits the tree into two subtrees with k and (100 - k) nodes, then that edge is part of k*(100 - k) paths. Therefore, the sum of all pairwise distances is equal to the sum over all edges of (length of edge) * (number of paths that include it), which is (length of edge) * k*(100 - k).But again, this requires knowing the structure of the tree, which we don't have. So, perhaps this isn't directly useful.Let me think differently. If we can measure the distances in such a way that each edge is included in exactly one measurement, then we could directly sum those measurements to get the total length. But in a tree, each edge is part of multiple paths, so it's not possible for each edge to be included in only one measurement.Alternatively, if we can measure distances that correspond to edges in a way that each edge is isolated, but since we don't know the edges, we can't directly measure them.Wait, maybe we can use the concept of a traversal. For example, if we perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree, measuring the distances from the root to each node. Then, the distance from the root to each node is the sum of the edges along the path from the root to that node. If we have these distances, we can compute the lengths of the edges by taking the differences between consecutive nodes in the traversal.But in this case, we would need to measure the distance from the root to each of the 99 other nodes, which would require 99 measurements. Then, the total length of the tree would be the sum of all these edge lengths, which can be computed by summing the differences.However, the problem is that we don't know the root or the structure of the tree. So, we can't necessarily perform a DFS traversal because we don't know the parent-child relationships.But perhaps we can choose an arbitrary city as the root and measure its distance to all other cities. That would give us 99 measurements. Then, using those measurements, we can compute the lengths of the edges along the paths from the root to each city.Wait, but in a tree, each edge is shared by multiple paths. So, if we measure the distance from the root to each city, we can reconstruct the tree by looking at the differences in distances. For example, if city A is at distance d from the root, and city B is at distance d + e, and city B is a child of city A, then the edge from A to B has length e.But without knowing the parent-child relationships, how can we determine which cities are directly connected? We might need additional information.Alternatively, if we measure the distances from two different roots, we can triangulate the edge lengths. But that would require more measurements.Wait, maybe another approach. If we can measure the distances between all pairs of cities in a way that each edge is included in exactly two measurements, then we can solve for each edge's length by subtracting the two measurements. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of linear algebra. Each distance measurement is a linear equation involving the sum of certain edges. If we can set up 99 independent equations, we can solve for the 99 edge lengths. Since we're allowed 100 measurements, which is more than 99, it's possible to have a system with more equations than variables, but as long as the equations are independent, we can solve for the edge lengths.But how do we ensure that the measurements are independent? Each measurement corresponds to a path, and the path can be represented as a vector where each entry corresponds to an edge, and the value is 1 if the edge is in the path and 0 otherwise. The set of these vectors should form a basis for the space of edge lengths.In a tree, the number of independent paths is equal to the number of edges, which is 99. So, if we can choose 99 paths (measurements) such that their corresponding vectors are linearly independent, then we can solve for the edge lengths.But how do we choose these paths? One way is to perform measurements along all the edges in a spanning tree, but again, we don't know the edges. So, perhaps we can use a different strategy.Another idea is to use the concept of a fundamental cycle basis, but since it's a tree, there are no cycles, so that doesn't apply.Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that in a tree, any two paths that share a common edge can be combined to eliminate that edge. So, if we measure the distance between two cities, and then measure the distance between one of those cities and a third city, we can subtract the two measurements to get the distance between the second and third city, effectively eliminating the common edge.But this seems like it could be a way to iteratively solve for the edges. For example, if we have a root city, and measure its distance to all other cities, then for each pair of cities, the distance between them can be found by subtracting their distances from the root. However, this only works if the two cities share the root as their lowest common ancestor. If they don't, then the subtraction won't give the correct distance.But perhaps if we have multiple roots or multiple reference points, we can triangulate the distances. However, this might complicate things.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the problem differently. If we can measure the distances between 100 pairs of cities, can we reconstruct the entire tree and thus compute the total length?In graph theory, there's a concept called the \\"distance matrix\\" which, for a tree, can be used to reconstruct the tree. However, reconstructing the tree typically requires knowing all pairwise distances, which is 4950 measurements for 100 cities. But the problem allows only 100 measurements, which is much less.However, the question isn't asking us to reconstruct the entire tree, just to determine the total length of the network. So, maybe we don't need to know each edge's length individually, but just their sum.Is there a way to compute the total length without knowing each edge's length? For example, if we can find a set of measurements whose sum equals the total length multiplied by some factor, then we can divide by that factor to get the total length.But I don't see an immediate way to do that. Each measurement is a sum of edges along a path, and the total length is the sum of all edges. So, unless we can find a combination of measurements that covers each edge exactly once, which seems difficult because each edge is part of multiple paths.Wait, but in a tree, each edge is part of exactly (number of nodes in one subtree) * (number of nodes in the other subtree) paths. So, if we sum all pairwise distances, each edge is counted multiple times. Specifically, if an edge splits the tree into two subtrees with k and (100 - k) nodes, then that edge is included in k*(100 - k) paths. Therefore, the sum of all pairwise distances is equal to the sum over all edges of (length of edge) * (k*(100 - k)).But we don't know the structure of the tree, so we don't know the values of k for each edge. Therefore, we can't directly compute the total length from the sum of all pairwise distances because we don't know how many times each edge is counted.However, if we can find a way to measure a subset of distances such that each edge is included in exactly one measurement, then the sum of those measurements would be equal to the total length. But in a tree, each edge is part of multiple paths, so it's impossible for each edge to be included in only one measurement unless we measure exactly the edges, which we can't do because we don't know where they are.Alternatively, if we can measure distances in such a way that each edge is included in a known number of measurements, then we can set up an equation where the sum of the measurements equals the total length multiplied by that known factor. But again, without knowing the structure, it's difficult.Wait, perhaps another approach. If we can measure the distances from one city to all others, that gives us 99 measurements. Then, the total length of the tree can be found by summing the distances from the root to each city and then dividing by something? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each edge is counted multiple times in those distances.But if we have the distances from the root to each city, we can compute the lengths of the edges by looking at the differences. For example, if city A is at distance d from the root, and city B is a child of city A at distance d + e, then the edge from A to B has length e. However, without knowing the parent-child relationships, we can't directly compute the edge lengths from just the distances.But if we have multiple reference points, maybe we can triangulate the edges. For example, if we measure the distances from two different roots, we can find the overlapping paths and deduce the edge lengths.But this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure if it can be done within 100 measurements.Wait, let's think about the problem again. We have a tree with 100 nodes and 99 edges. We can measure the distance between any two nodes, which gives us the sum of the edges along the path between them. We need to determine the total length of all edges, which is the sum of all 99 edge lengths.If we can find a set of 99 measurements such that each edge is included in exactly one measurement, then the sum of those measurements would be equal to the total length. But as I thought earlier, in a tree, each edge is part of multiple paths, so it's impossible for each edge to be included in only one measurement unless we measure exactly the edges, which we can't do.Alternatively, if we can find a set of measurements where each edge is included in a known number of measurements, then we can set up an equation where the sum of the measurements equals the total length multiplied by that known factor. But without knowing the structure, it's difficult.Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that the total length is equal to the sum of all edge lengths, and each edge is part of multiple paths. If we can measure a set of paths such that each edge is included in exactly two measurements, then the sum of all measurements would be twice the total length. But how?Actually, in a tree, if we consider all the edges, each edge is part of (k*(100 - k)) paths, where k is the number of nodes on one side of the edge. So, if we could measure all those paths, the sum would be the sum of (length of edge) * (k*(100 - k)). But again, we don't know k.However, if we can measure a set of paths such that each edge is included in exactly two measurements, then the sum of those measurements would be twice the total length. But how can we ensure that each edge is included in exactly two measurements?Wait, perhaps if we perform measurements along all the edges in a way that each edge is measured twice. But since we don't know the edges, we can't directly measure them. So, this approach might not work.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of linear algebra again. We have 99 variables (edge lengths) and we can make 100 measurements (equations). Each equation is a sum of some subset of the variables. As long as these equations are independent, we can solve for the variables.But how do we ensure independence? Each measurement corresponds to a path, and the path can be represented as a binary vector indicating which edges are included. The set of these vectors should be linearly independent.In a tree, the number of independent paths is equal to the number of edges, which is 99. So, if we can choose 99 paths such that their corresponding vectors are linearly independent, then we can solve for the edge lengths. Since we're allowed 100 measurements, which is one more than needed, we can have a redundant equation, but as long as the first 99 are independent, we can solve for the edges.But how do we choose these 99 paths? One way is to perform a traversal of the tree, such as a depth-first search, and measure the distances along the paths from the root to each node. This would give us 99 measurements, each corresponding to a unique path from the root to a leaf. These paths would form a set of vectors where each subsequent vector is the previous one plus a new edge. Therefore, these vectors are linearly independent because each new vector adds a new edge that wasn't in the previous ones.Wait, but in reality, the tree isn't necessarily a straight line, so the paths from the root to different nodes might share edges. Therefore, the vectors might not be linearly independent. For example, if two paths share a common edge, their vectors would have a 1 in the same position, making them not linearly independent.Hmm, that's a problem. So, measuring the distances from the root to each node might not give us linearly independent equations because the paths share edges.But wait, in linear algebra, even if vectors share some common components, they can still be linearly independent if they don't lie in the same subspace. For example, in a tree, the paths from the root to different nodes form a set of vectors where each vector is the sum of the edges along its path. These vectors are actually linearly independent because each edge is only added once in the order of the traversal.Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, consider a root connected to two children, A and B. The path from root to A is [1,0], and from root to B is [0,1]. These are independent. But if the tree is deeper, say root connected to A, which is connected to C and D, then the paths are root-A-C and root-A-D. The vectors would be [1,1,0] and [1,0,1]. These are still independent because you can't express one as a combination of the other.Wait, actually, in a tree, the set of paths from the root to each node forms a set of vectors that are linearly independent. Because each path introduces a new edge that wasn't present in the previous paths. Therefore, if we measure the distances from the root to each node, we get 99 measurements that correspond to 99 linearly independent vectors. Therefore, we can solve for the edge lengths.But wait, in reality, the tree isn't necessarily a straight line, so some paths might share multiple edges. For example, in a balanced tree, the paths from the root to different leaves share many edges. Therefore, the vectors might not be independent.Wait, no, actually, in a tree, the paths from the root to each node are unique and each introduces at least one new edge that wasn't in the previous paths. Therefore, the set of vectors is upper triangular in some ordering, meaning they are linearly independent.Wait, let me think about it more carefully. Suppose we have a tree where the root is connected to node A, which is connected to node B, which is connected to node C. The paths are root-A, root-A-B, root-A-B-C. The corresponding vectors would be [1,0,0], [1,1,0], [1,1,1]. These are linearly independent because each new vector adds a new 1 in a new position. Similarly, if the tree branches, say root connected to A and B, then the paths are root-A and root-B, which are [1,0] and [0,1], which are independent.Therefore, in general, if we perform a traversal of the tree, measuring the distances from the root to each node in the order of the traversal, the corresponding vectors are linearly independent. Therefore, with 99 measurements, we can solve for the 99 edge lengths.But the problem allows us to make 100 measurements, which is one more than needed. So, we can make 99 measurements from the root to each node, solve for the edge lengths, and then sum them up to get the total length. The extra measurement can be used to verify the solution or to handle any redundancy.Therefore, the answer is yes, it is possible to determine the total length of the entire road network with 100 measurements.Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check. If we measure the distances from the root to each node, we get 99 measurements. Each measurement corresponds to a path that includes all the edges from the root to that node. These paths are such that each subsequent path includes all the edges of the previous path plus one new edge. Therefore, the vectors are linearly independent because each new vector has a new 1 in a position where all previous vectors have 0. Therefore, the system of equations is upper triangular and can be solved by back substitution.Yes, that makes sense. So, by measuring the distances from an arbitrary root to all other 99 cities, we can set up a system of 99 equations that are linearly independent, allowing us to solve for each edge's length. Then, summing all the edge lengths gives us the total length of the network. Since we're allowed 100 measurements, we can use the extra one to verify our solution or to handle any potential errors.Therefore, the answer is yes, it is possible."},{"question":"A triangle is made of wood sticks of lengths 8, 15 and 17 inches joined end-to-end. Pieces of the same integral length are cut from each of the sticks so that the three remaining pieces can no longer form a triangle. How many inches are in the length of the smallest piece that can be cut from each of the three sticks to make this happen?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about a triangle made from wood sticks with lengths 8, 15, and 17 inches. The goal is to cut pieces of the same integral length from each stick so that the remaining pieces can no longer form a triangle. I need to find the smallest such length that can be cut from each stick. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I know that for three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. That is, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, if after cutting, the remaining pieces don't satisfy this condition, they can't form a triangle. That makes sense.The original sticks are 8, 15, and 17 inches. Let me denote the length we're cutting from each stick as ( x ) inches. Since we're cutting the same length from each, the remaining lengths will be ( 8 - x ), ( 15 - x ), and ( 17 - x ). These remaining pieces should not form a triangle. So, I need to find the smallest integer ( x ) such that the triangle inequality is violated for these new lengths.Let me write down the triangle inequalities for the remaining pieces:1. ( (8 - x) + (15 - x) > (17 - x) )2. ( (8 - x) + (17 - x) > (15 - x) )3. ( (15 - x) + (17 - x) > (8 - x) )If any one of these inequalities is not satisfied, the three remaining pieces can't form a triangle. So, I need to find the smallest ( x ) such that at least one of these inequalities is false.Let me simplify each inequality one by one.Starting with the first inequality:1. ( (8 - x) + (15 - x) > (17 - x) )Simplify the left side: ( 23 - 2x > 17 - x )Subtract 17 from both sides: ( 6 - 2x > -x )Add ( 2x ) to both sides: ( 6 > x )So, ( x < 6 )Hmm, so if ( x ) is less than 6, the first inequality holds. But we need the remaining pieces to not form a triangle, so we need this inequality to be false. Therefore, ( x ) must be greater than or equal to 6.Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. If ( x < 6 ), the inequality holds, meaning the pieces can form a triangle. So, to prevent them from forming a triangle, we need ( x ) to be such that the inequality does not hold, which would be ( x geq 6 ). But let me check the other inequalities as well.Second inequality:2. ( (8 - x) + (17 - x) > (15 - x) )Simplify the left side: ( 25 - 2x > 15 - x )Subtract 15 from both sides: ( 10 - 2x > -x )Add ( 2x ) to both sides: ( 10 > x )So, ( x < 10 )Again, if ( x < 10 ), the inequality holds. So, to make this inequality false, ( x ) must be greater than or equal to 10.Third inequality:3. ( (15 - x) + (17 - x) > (8 - x) )Simplify the left side: ( 32 - 2x > 8 - x )Subtract 8 from both sides: ( 24 - 2x > -x )Add ( 2x ) to both sides: ( 24 > x )So, ( x < 24 )This inequality will hold as long as ( x < 24 ). Since ( x ) is being cut from sticks of lengths 8, 15, and 17, ( x ) can't be more than 8, because otherwise, one of the sticks would have a negative length, which doesn't make sense. So, ( x ) must be less than 8. Therefore, this third inequality will always hold for any valid ( x ) (since ( x ) can't be 24 or more). So, we can ignore this third inequality because it's automatically satisfied.So, summarizing the first two inequalities:1. ( x geq 6 ) to make the first inequality false.2. ( x geq 10 ) to make the second inequality false.But wait, ( x ) can't be 10 because the shortest stick is 8 inches. If we cut 10 inches from each, the remaining lengths would be negative, which isn't possible. So, the maximum ( x ) can be is 8 inches. Therefore, ( x ) must be less than or equal to 8.But hold on, the problem says \\"pieces of the same integral length are cut from each of the sticks.\\" So, ( x ) must be an integer, and ( x ) must be such that ( 8 - x ), ( 15 - x ), and ( 17 - x ) are all positive. So, ( x ) can be at most 7 inches because if ( x = 8 ), then the first stick would have length 0, which isn't allowed.So, ( x ) can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 inches. But we need the smallest ( x ) such that the remaining pieces can't form a triangle. So, let's test ( x = 6 ) first.If ( x = 6 ), the remaining lengths are:- 8 - 6 = 2 inches- 15 - 6 = 9 inches- 17 - 6 = 11 inchesNow, let's check the triangle inequalities for these lengths:1. 2 + 9 > 11? 11 > 11? No, 11 is not greater than 11. It's equal. So, this fails the triangle inequality. Therefore, with ( x = 6 ), the remaining pieces cannot form a triangle.Wait, but hold on. The triangle inequality requires the sum to be greater, not just equal. So, if the sum is equal, it's a degenerate triangle, which is essentially a straight line, not a valid triangle. So, yes, ( x = 6 ) would make the remaining pieces unable to form a triangle.But let me check if ( x = 5 ) would also work, just to make sure 6 is indeed the smallest.If ( x = 5 ), the remaining lengths are:- 8 - 5 = 3 inches- 15 - 5 = 10 inches- 17 - 5 = 12 inchesNow, check the triangle inequalities:1. 3 + 10 > 12? 13 > 12? Yes.2. 3 + 12 > 10? 15 > 10? Yes.3. 10 + 12 > 3? 22 > 3? Yes.All inequalities hold, so the pieces can still form a triangle. Therefore, ( x = 5 ) is not sufficient.Similarly, let's check ( x = 4 ):Remaining lengths: 4, 11, 13.Check inequalities:1. 4 + 11 > 13? 15 > 13? Yes.2. 4 + 13 > 11? 17 > 11? Yes.3. 11 + 13 > 4? 24 > 4? Yes.Still a valid triangle. So, ( x = 4 ) is not enough.( x = 3 ):Remaining lengths: 5, 12, 14.Check:1. 5 + 12 > 14? 17 > 14? Yes.2. 5 + 14 > 12? 19 > 12? Yes.3. 12 + 14 > 5? 26 > 5? Yes.Still a triangle. Moving on.( x = 2 ):Remaining lengths: 6, 13, 15.Check:1. 6 + 13 > 15? 19 > 15? Yes.2. 6 + 15 > 13? 21 > 13? Yes.3. 13 + 15 > 6? 28 > 6? Yes.Still a triangle. Hmm.( x = 1 ):Remaining lengths: 7, 14, 16.Check:1. 7 + 14 > 16? 21 > 16? Yes.2. 7 + 16 > 14? 23 > 14? Yes.3. 14 + 16 > 7? 30 > 7? Yes.Still a triangle. So, ( x = 1 ) is not enough.Therefore, the smallest ( x ) that works is 6 inches. Because when ( x = 6 ), the remaining lengths are 2, 9, and 11 inches, which cannot form a triangle since 2 + 9 = 11, which is not greater than 11.Wait, just to make sure, is there a possibility that another inequality could fail for ( x = 6 )? Let me check all three inequalities again with ( x = 6 ):1. 2 + 9 > 11? 11 > 11? No.2. 2 + 11 > 9? 13 > 9? Yes.3. 9 + 11 > 2? 20 > 2? Yes.So, only the first inequality fails, which is enough to prevent the formation of a triangle. Therefore, ( x = 6 ) is indeed the smallest integer length that can be cut from each stick to make the remaining pieces unable to form a triangle.But hold on, let me think again. The problem says \\"pieces of the same integral length are cut from each of the sticks.\\" So, ( x ) must be an integer. We found that ( x = 6 ) is the smallest integer where the remaining pieces can't form a triangle. So, 6 inches is the answer.But just to double-check, is there a way that cutting 6 inches from each stick could result in a different combination where the triangle inequality holds? Let me see.After cutting 6 inches, the sticks are 2, 9, and 11. The only way to check if they can form a triangle is to see if the sum of the two shorter sticks is greater than the longest stick. The two shorter sticks are 2 and 9, which add up to 11. Since 11 is not greater than 11, it fails. So, no triangle can be formed.Therefore, I'm confident that 6 inches is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The smallest length to cut from each stick is boxed{6} inches."},{"question":"Vanya decided to give Masha a bouquet of an odd number of flowers, consisting of yellow and red tulips, so that the count of one color differs from the count of the other by exactly one. Yellow tulips cost 50 rubles each, and red tulips cost 31 rubles each. What is the maximum number of tulips he can buy for Masha's birthday bouquet without spending more than 600 rubles?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where Vanya wants to buy Masha a bouquet of tulips. The bouquet needs to have an odd number of flowers, and it should consist of yellow and red tulips. The key points are:1. The total number of tulips must be odd.2. The count of one color must differ from the other by exactly one. So, if there are Y yellow tulips and R red tulips, then either Y = R + 1 or R = Y + 1.3. Yellow tulips cost 50 rubles each, and red tulips cost 31 rubles each.4. The total cost shouldn't exceed 600 rubles.5. We need to find the maximum number of tulips Vanya can buy under these constraints.Okay, let's break this down step by step.First, since the total number of tulips must be odd, and the counts of yellow and red differ by exactly one, that means one color will have one more tulip than the other. So, if the total number of tulips is N, which is odd, then N = Y + R, where Y = R + 1 or R = Y + 1. So, if N is odd, then Y and R must be consecutive integers, one even and one odd.Let me represent this algebraically. Let’s say Y = R + 1. Then, N = Y + R = (R + 1) + R = 2R + 1. So, N is an odd number, as expected. Similarly, if R = Y + 1, then N = Y + (Y + 1) = 2Y + 1, which is also odd.So, in both cases, N is of the form 2k + 1, where k is an integer. So, the total number of tulips is 2k + 1, with either Y = k + 1 and R = k, or Y = k and R = k + 1.Now, the cost is 50 rubles per yellow tulip and 31 rubles per red tulip. So, the total cost C is given by:C = 50Y + 31RAnd we need C ≤ 600.Our goal is to maximize N, which is 2k + 1, so we need to find the largest possible k such that 50Y + 31R ≤ 600.Let me consider both cases where Y = R + 1 and R = Y + 1.Case 1: Y = R + 1Then, Y = R + 1, so N = 2R + 1.Total cost: C = 50(R + 1) + 31R = 50R + 50 + 31R = 81R + 50We need 81R + 50 ≤ 600Subtract 50: 81R ≤ 550Divide by 81: R ≤ 550 / 81 ≈ 6.790Since R must be an integer, R ≤ 6So, maximum R is 6, then Y = 7, N = 13.Total cost: 81*6 + 50 = 486 + 50 = 536 rubles.Case 2: R = Y + 1Then, R = Y + 1, so N = 2Y + 1.Total cost: C = 50Y + 31(Y + 1) = 50Y + 31Y + 31 = 81Y + 31We need 81Y + 31 ≤ 600Subtract 31: 81Y ≤ 569Divide by 81: Y ≤ 569 / 81 ≈ 7.024So, Y ≤ 7Thus, maximum Y is 7, R = 8, N = 15.Total cost: 81*7 + 31 = 567 + 31 = 598 rubles.Wait, so in Case 2, we can have 15 tulips for 598 rubles, which is under 600. In Case 1, we have 13 tulips for 536 rubles.So, clearly, Case 2 gives a larger number of tulips without exceeding the budget.But hold on, is 15 the maximum possible? Let me check if we can go higher.Wait, let me think. Maybe there are other combinations where the counts of yellow and red tulips differ by one, but not necessarily in the way I considered above.Wait, no, because the problem states that the counts differ by exactly one. So, it's either Y = R +1 or R = Y +1. So, the two cases I considered are the only possibilities.But wait, perhaps I can have different distributions where the counts are not exactly one apart, but the total is still odd? Wait, no, the problem says that the counts must differ by exactly one. So, it's a strict condition.So, the two cases are the only possibilities.But in Case 2, we can get 15 tulips, which is more than 13 in Case 1. So, 15 is better.But let me check if 15 is indeed the maximum.Wait, let me see. If I try Y = 8, then R = 9, so N = 17.Total cost: 50*8 + 31*9 = 400 + 279 = 679 rubles, which is over 600.So, that's too expensive.What about Y = 7, R = 8: 50*7 + 31*8 = 350 + 248 = 598, which is under 600.So, 15 tulips is possible.Is there a way to have more than 15 tulips without exceeding 600 rubles? Let's see.If I try N = 17, which would require Y = 9, R = 8 or Y = 8, R = 9.Wait, Y = 9, R = 8: 50*9 + 31*8 = 450 + 248 = 698 rubles, which is over 600.Y = 8, R = 9: 50*8 + 31*9 = 400 + 279 = 679, still over.So, 17 is too much.How about N = 15, which we already saw is 598. That's under 600.Is there a way to have N = 15 with a different combination?Wait, no, because for N = 15, the counts must be Y = 7, R = 8 or Y = 8, R = 7.Wait, hold on, in Case 1, Y = R +1, so Y = 8, R =7, which would give N =15 as well.Wait, no, in Case 1, Y = R +1, so if N =15, then Y =8, R=7.Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I considered Case 2 as R = Y +1, which gives Y=7, R=8.So, both cases can result in N=15, but with different Y and R counts.Wait, so in both cases, N=15 is possible, but with different Y and R.So, in Case 1: Y=8, R=7, total cost=50*8 +31*7=400 +217=617, which is over 600.Wait, that's a problem. So, in Case 1, when N=15, the cost is 617, which is over 600.But in Case 2, when N=15, it's Y=7, R=8, which is 50*7 +31*8=350 +248=598, which is under 600.So, in Case 1, N=15 is too expensive, but in Case 2, N=15 is affordable.So, that's why in Case 1, the maximum N is 13, but in Case 2, it's 15.Therefore, 15 is the maximum number of tulips.Wait, but let me confirm.Is there a way to get more than 15 tulips without exceeding 600?Let me see.Suppose I try N=17, but as we saw, it's too expensive.What about N=16? Wait, no, N must be odd. So, next is N=17, which is too expensive.So, 15 is the maximum.But wait, let me think differently.Is there a way to have a different distribution where Y and R differ by one, but not necessarily in the way I considered?Wait, no, because the problem says the counts must differ by exactly one. So, it's either Y = R +1 or R = Y +1.So, the two cases are the only possibilities.But let me check if I can have a different combination where Y and R differ by one, but with more tulips.Wait, for example, if Y=6, R=7, which gives N=13, total cost=50*6 +31*7=300 +217=517.Which is under 600, but less than 15.Alternatively, Y=9, R=10: N=19, total cost=50*9 +31*10=450 +310=760, which is way over.So, no, that's too expensive.Wait, so 15 is the maximum.But let me check if there's a way to have N=15 with a different combination.Wait, no, because N=15 must have either Y=8, R=7 or Y=7, R=8.We saw that Y=7, R=8 is 598, which is under 600.Y=8, R=7 is 617, which is over.So, only Y=7, R=8 is acceptable.So, 15 tulips is the maximum.Wait, but let me think again.Is there a way to have a different number of tulips, say N=15, but with a different distribution?Wait, no, because the counts must differ by exactly one. So, N=15 must have Y=7, R=8 or Y=8, R=7.So, we can't have any other distribution.Therefore, 15 is the maximum.But wait, let me check if I can have N=15 with Y=7, R=8, which is 598, and then maybe add another tulip, but that would make N=16, which is even, which is not allowed.Alternatively, maybe adjust the counts to have a different distribution.Wait, but the counts must differ by exactly one, so we can't have N=15 with Y=6, R=9, because that would make the difference 3, which is more than one.So, no, that's not allowed.So, 15 is the maximum.Wait, but let me think about the cost.In Case 2, when N=15, Y=7, R=8, total cost=598.So, we have 2 rubles left.Is there a way to use those 2 rubles to get another tulip?But we can't, because each tulip is either 50 or 31 rubles, which are both more than 2.So, no, we can't add another tulip.Alternatively, maybe adjust the counts to have a different combination where we can use the remaining money.But since the counts must differ by exactly one, we can't just add another tulip without changing the difference.Wait, for example, if we have Y=7, R=8, total cost=598.If we try to add another yellow tulip, making Y=8, R=8, but then the counts differ by zero, which is not allowed.Similarly, adding another red tulip would make R=9, Y=7, difference=2, which is not allowed.So, we can't do that.Alternatively, maybe reduce some tulips and use the saved money to buy more of the cheaper ones.Wait, let's see.Suppose we have Y=7, R=8, total cost=598.If we remove one yellow tulip, we save 50 rubles, and then we can buy more red tulips.But since the counts must differ by exactly one, removing one yellow tulip would make Y=6, R=8, difference=2, which is not allowed.Alternatively, remove one red tulip, save 31 rubles, and add another yellow tulip, making Y=8, R=7, but that's the same as Case 1, which costs 617, which is over 600.Wait, but we have 2 rubles left, so 617 - 600 = 17 rubles over.So, that's not helpful.Alternatively, maybe remove two red tulips, save 62 rubles, and add one yellow tulip, but that would make Y=8, R=6, difference=2, which is not allowed.Hmm, seems tricky.Alternatively, maybe remove one red tulip and one yellow tulip, saving 50 +31=81 rubles, and then use that to buy more tulips.But then, we would have Y=6, R=7, which is N=13, total cost=50*6 +31*7=300 +217=517.Then, we have 600 -517=83 rubles left.With 83 rubles, can we buy more tulips?Each tulip is either 50 or 31.So, 83 divided by 50 is 1 with remainder 33.33 divided by 31 is 1 with remainder 2.So, we can buy one yellow and one red tulip, costing 50 +31=81, leaving 2 rubles.So, total tulips would be Y=6+1=7, R=7+1=8, which is back to the original N=15, total cost=598.So, that doesn't help.Alternatively, maybe buy two red tulips: 31*2=62, leaving 83-62=21, which isn't enough for another tulip.So, that's not helpful.Alternatively, buy one red tulip: 31, leaving 83-31=52, which isn't enough for another yellow tulip.So, no.So, seems like we can't get more than 15 tulips without exceeding the budget.Therefore, the maximum number of tulips is 15.But let me double-check my calculations.Case 1: Y = R +1Total cost: 81R +50 ≤60081R ≤550R ≤6.790, so R=6, Y=7, N=13, cost=536.Case 2: R = Y +1Total cost:81Y +31 ≤60081Y ≤569Y ≤7.024, so Y=7, R=8, N=15, cost=598.So, yes, 15 is the maximum.Wait, but in Case 1, if R=6, Y=7, N=13, cost=536.If I try to increase R to 7, then Y=8, N=15, cost=81*7 +50=567 +50=617>600.So, that's over.Similarly, in Case 2, Y=7, R=8, N=15, cost=598.If I try Y=8, R=9, N=17, cost=81*8 +31=648 +31=679>600.So, that's over.Therefore, 15 is indeed the maximum.Wait, but let me think again.Is there a way to have more tulips by having a different combination where the counts differ by one, but not necessarily in the way I considered?Wait, for example, maybe Y=5, R=6, which would give N=11, cost=50*5 +31*6=250 +186=436.Then, with the remaining 600-436=164 rubles, can I buy more tulips?But the counts must differ by exactly one, so I can't just add tulips without adjusting.Alternatively, maybe adjust the counts.Wait, but if I have Y=5, R=6, and then try to add one yellow tulip, making Y=6, R=6, which is difference zero, not allowed.Alternatively, add one red tulip, making R=7, Y=5, difference=2, not allowed.So, no.Alternatively, maybe remove some tulips and buy more of the cheaper ones.But that seems counterproductive.Wait, perhaps if I have Y=4, R=5, N=9, cost=50*4 +31*5=200 +155=355.Then, with 600-355=245 rubles left, can I buy more tulips?But again, the counts must differ by exactly one.So, if I try to add tulips, I have to maintain the difference of one.Alternatively, maybe buy more red tulips since they are cheaper.But if I have Y=4, R=5, and try to add one red tulip, making R=6, Y=4, difference=2, not allowed.Alternatively, add one yellow and one red, making Y=5, R=6, which is difference=1, but that would cost 50 +31=81, so total cost=355 +81=436, which is what we had before.So, no gain.Alternatively, maybe buy two red tulips: 31*2=62, making R=7, Y=4, difference=3, not allowed.So, no.Alternatively, buy one red and one yellow: same as before.So, seems like no way to get more tulips.Therefore, 15 is the maximum.Wait, but let me think differently.Suppose I don't fix Y and R to be consecutive, but instead, find all possible combinations where Y and R differ by one, and N is odd, and find the maximum N where 50Y +31R ≤600.So, let's try to model this.Let me define N = Y + R, which is odd.And Y = R ±1.So, for each possible N, starting from the maximum possible, check if there exists Y and R such that Y = R ±1, and 50Y +31R ≤600.So, let's find the maximum N.What's the maximum possible N?Well, if all tulips were red, which are cheaper, then N_max = 600 /31 ≈19.35, so 19.But since we need N to be odd, the maximum possible N is 19.But we need Y and R to differ by one.So, let's check N=19.Possible Y and R:Case 1: Y=10, R=9.Total cost=50*10 +31*9=500 +279=779>600.Case 2: Y=9, R=10.Total cost=50*9 +31*10=450 +310=760>600.So, N=19 is too expensive.Next, N=17.Case 1: Y=9, R=8.Total cost=50*9 +31*8=450 +248=698>600.Case 2: Y=8, R=9.Total cost=50*8 +31*9=400 +279=679>600.Still too expensive.N=15.Case 1: Y=8, R=7.Total cost=50*8 +31*7=400 +217=617>600.Case 2: Y=7, R=8.Total cost=50*7 +31*8=350 +248=598≤600.So, N=15 is possible.N=13.Case 1: Y=7, R=6.Total cost=50*7 +31*6=350 +186=536≤600.Case 2: Y=6, R=7.Total cost=50*6 +31*7=300 +217=517≤600.So, N=13 is possible, but we already have N=15.So, N=15 is better.Therefore, the maximum N is 15.Wait, but let me check N=15 again.Y=7, R=8, cost=598.Is there a way to adjust Y and R to get a higher N without exceeding the budget?Wait, if I try Y=7, R=8, cost=598.If I remove one red tulip, saving 31, and add one yellow tulip, making Y=8, R=7, which costs 50 more, so total cost=598 -31 +50=617>600.So, that's over.Alternatively, remove one yellow tulip, saving 50, and add one red tulip, making Y=6, R=9, which costs 31 more, so total cost=598 -50 +31=579.But then, Y=6, R=9, difference=3, which is not allowed.So, that's invalid.Alternatively, remove two red tulips, saving 62, and add two yellow tulips, but that would make Y=9, R=6, difference=3, invalid.So, no.Alternatively, remove one red and one yellow, saving 81, and add two red tulips, but that would make Y=6, R=9, difference=3, invalid.Hmm.Alternatively, maybe remove one red tulip, saving 31, and use it to buy another red tulip? Wait, that doesn't make sense.Wait, perhaps remove one red tulip, save 31, and buy another tulip, but we can't because the counts must differ by one.Wait, no, we can't just add another tulip without adjusting.So, seems like N=15 is the maximum.Therefore, the answer is 15 tulips.**Final Answer**The maximum number of tulips Vanya can buy is boxed{15}."},{"question":"If log_{2}(m^{2}-3m-3) + ilog_{2}(m-2) is a pure imaginary number, find the value of the real number m.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If log base 2 of (m squared minus 3m minus 3) plus i times log base 2 of (m minus 2) is a pure imaginary number, find the value of the real number m. Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, I remember that a complex number is pure imaginary if its real part is zero. So, in this case, the expression given is a complex number where the real part is log base 2 of (m² - 3m - 3) and the imaginary part is log base 2 of (m - 2). So, for the entire expression to be purely imaginary, the real part must be zero. That means log₂(m² - 3m - 3) should equal zero.Alright, so let me write that down:log₂(m² - 3m - 3) = 0I know that log base 2 of something equals zero means that something must be equal to 2⁰, which is 1. So,m² - 3m - 3 = 1Let me solve this quadratic equation. Subtract 1 from both sides:m² - 3m - 4 = 0Now, factoring this quadratic. Hmm, looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to -3. Let's see, 1 and -4? Yeah, 1 * (-4) = -4 and 1 + (-4) = -3. So, the factors are (m + 1)(m - 4) = 0.So, the solutions are m = -1 and m = 4.But wait, hold on. Since we're dealing with logarithms, the arguments must be positive. So, I need to check if these solutions make the arguments of both logarithms positive.First, let's check m = -1.For log₂(m² - 3m - 3):Plug in m = -1: (-1)² - 3*(-1) - 3 = 1 + 3 - 3 = 1. That's positive, so that's okay.For log₂(m - 2):Plug in m = -1: (-1) - 2 = -3. That's negative, which is not allowed in logarithms. So, m = -1 is invalid.Now, check m = 4.For log₂(m² - 3m - 3):Plug in m = 4: 16 - 12 - 3 = 1. Positive, so that's fine.For log₂(m - 2):Plug in m = 4: 4 - 2 = 2. Positive, so that's also fine.Therefore, m = 4 is the valid solution.Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check.Given m = 4:log₂(4² - 3*4 - 3) = log₂(16 - 12 - 3) = log₂(1) = 0. That's correct.And log₂(4 - 2) = log₂(2) = 1. So, the expression becomes 0 + i*1 = i, which is indeed a pure imaginary number. Perfect.But let me think again about the initial equation. The expression is log₂(m² - 3m - 3) + i log₂(m - 2). So, for this to be purely imaginary, the real part must be zero, which we set to zero. But is there any other condition?Well, the imaginary part can be any real number, but the logarithm must be defined. So, as long as m - 2 is positive, which for m = 4, it is. So, that's fine.Wait, but hold on. What if the imaginary part is zero? Then the entire expression would be zero, which is technically both real and imaginary. But in this case, the problem says it's a pure imaginary number, so I think that includes zero. But in our case, log₂(2) is 1, so the imaginary part is 1, so it's purely imaginary.But just to be thorough, let me consider if the imaginary part could be zero. If log₂(m - 2) = 0, then m - 2 = 1, so m = 3. Let's check m = 3.For log₂(m² - 3m - 3):Plug in m = 3: 9 - 9 - 3 = -3. That's negative, which is invalid. So, m = 3 is not a solution.So, the only valid solution is m = 4.Wait, but let me think again about the original expression. It's log₂(m² - 3m - 3) + i log₂(m - 2). So, if the real part is zero, the expression is purely imaginary. If the imaginary part is zero, the expression is real. But in this problem, it's given that the expression is purely imaginary, so the real part must be zero, regardless of the imaginary part.Therefore, the only condition is log₂(m² - 3m - 3) = 0, which gives m² - 3m - 3 = 1, leading to m² - 3m - 4 = 0, factoring to (m + 1)(m - 4) = 0, so m = -1 or m = 4. But m = -1 makes the argument of the second logarithm negative, so it's invalid. Thus, m = 4 is the only solution.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The value of ( m ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, where all sides are different, the bisector of angle BAC intersects side BC at point D.It is known that angle AB - BD = a and AC + CD = b.Find AD.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. We have triangle ABC, and all sides are different. That means it's a scalene triangle. The angle bisector of angle BAC intersects side BC at point D. So, AD is the angle bisector. Given that angle AB minus BD equals a, and AC plus CD equals b. We need to find the length of AD. Hmm, okay. Let me write down what I know.First, let's denote the sides of the triangle. In triangle ABC, the sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, c respectively. Wait, but in this problem, they're using a and b as given quantities. Maybe I should use different notation to avoid confusion. Let me denote the sides as follows: AB = c, AC = b', BC = a'. But wait, the problem says angle AB - BD = a. Hmm, that might be confusing because AB is a side, and BD is a segment on BC. Maybe I should clarify.Wait, the problem says \\"angle AB - BD = a\\". Wait, angle AB? That doesn't make sense. Angles are measured in degrees or radians, while AB and BD are lengths. So subtracting a length from an angle? That can't be right. Maybe it's a typo or misinterpretation. Let me check the original problem again.\\"In triangle ABC, where all sides are different, the bisector of angle BAC intersects side BC at point D. It is known that AB - BD = a and AC + CD = b. Find AD.\\"Oh, okay, so it's AB minus BD equals a, and AC plus CD equals b. That makes more sense. So AB - BD = a, and AC + CD = b. Got it. So both a and b are given as lengths. So, AB is a side, BD is a segment on BC, AC is another side, CD is the remaining segment on BC. So, BC is split into BD and DC by point D.Since AD is the angle bisector, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have that AB/AC = BD/DC. That's a key point. So, AB divided by AC equals BD divided by DC.Let me denote AB as c, AC as b', and BC as a'. Then, BD = (AB / (AB + AC)) * BC, but wait, no. The Angle Bisector Theorem says AB/AC = BD/DC. So, if I let BD = x, then DC = (AC/AB) * x. But since BD + DC = BC, we can write x + (AC/AB)*x = BC. So, x(1 + AC/AB) = BC. Therefore, x = BC / (1 + AC/AB) = (BC * AB)/(AB + AC). Similarly, DC = (BC * AC)/(AB + AC).But maybe it's better to assign variables to BD and DC. Let me let BD = x, so DC = (AC/AB) * x. Then, BD + DC = BC, so x + (AC/AB)x = BC. Therefore, x(1 + AC/AB) = BC, so x = BC / (1 + AC/AB) = (BC * AB)/(AB + AC). Hmm, same as before.But in the problem, we have AB - BD = a, so AB - x = a. So, AB - x = a. Also, AC + CD = b. Since CD is DC, which is (AC/AB) * x, so AC + (AC/AB)x = b.So, we have two equations:1. AB - x = a2. AC + (AC/AB)x = bLet me write AB as c and AC as d for simplicity. So, AB = c, AC = d.Then, equation 1: c - x = a => x = c - a.Equation 2: d + (d/c)x = b.Substituting x from equation 1 into equation 2:d + (d/c)(c - a) = bSimplify:d + d - (d a)/c = bSo, 2d - (d a)/c = bLet me factor out d:d(2 - a/c) = bTherefore, d = b / (2 - a/c) = (b c)/(2c - a)So, AC = d = (b c)/(2c - a)But we also have x = c - a, and from the Angle Bisector Theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC = c/d.So, BD/DC = c/d => x / DC = c/d => DC = (d/c) xBut DC = BC - BD = a' - x, but wait, BC is not given. Hmm, maybe I need another approach.Wait, perhaps I can express BC in terms of x and DC. Since BD = x and DC = (d/c)x, then BC = x + (d/c)x = x(1 + d/c) = x(c + d)/c.But from equation 1, x = c - a, so BC = (c - a)(c + d)/c.But I don't know BC yet. Maybe I can find BC in terms of a and b.Alternatively, let's see if I can express AD in terms of AB, AC, BD, DC.There's a formula for the length of an angle bisector. The formula is:AD = (2 AB AC cos (A/2)) / (AB + AC)But I don't know angle A, so maybe that's not helpful directly.Alternatively, the length of the angle bisector can also be expressed using the formula:AD = (2 AB AC / (AB + AC)) * cos (A/2)But again, without knowing angle A, it's tricky.Alternatively, there's another formula for the length of the angle bisector:AD^2 = AB * AC - BD * DCYes, that's the formula from the Angle Bisector Theorem. So, AD squared equals AB times AC minus BD times DC.So, AD^2 = AB * AC - BD * DC.So, if I can find AB, AC, BD, DC, then I can compute AD.From earlier, we have AB = c, AC = d = (b c)/(2c - a), BD = x = c - a, DC = (d/c)x = ( (b c)/(2c - a) / c )*(c - a) = (b / (2c - a))*(c - a).So, DC = (b(c - a))/(2c - a)Therefore, BD * DC = (c - a) * (b(c - a))/(2c - a) = b(c - a)^2 / (2c - a)So, AD^2 = AB * AC - BD * DC = c * d - BD * DC = c * (b c)/(2c - a) - b(c - a)^2 / (2c - a)Let me compute that:AD^2 = (b c^2)/(2c - a) - (b(c - a)^2)/(2c - a) = [b c^2 - b(c - a)^2]/(2c - a)Factor out b:AD^2 = b [c^2 - (c - a)^2]/(2c - a)Compute c^2 - (c - a)^2:= c^2 - (c^2 - 2ac + a^2) = c^2 - c^2 + 2ac - a^2 = 2ac - a^2 = a(2c - a)So, AD^2 = b [a(2c - a)] / (2c - a) = b aTherefore, AD^2 = a b => AD = sqrt(a b)Wow, that's neat. So, AD is the square root of a times b.Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Assigned AB = c, AC = d.2. From AB - BD = a, BD = c - a.3. From AC + CD = b, and CD = (d/c) BD, so AC + (d/c)(c - a) = b.4. Substituted and solved for d: d = (b c)/(2c - a).5. Expressed DC in terms of c and a: DC = (b(c - a))/(2c - a).6. Applied the angle bisector length formula: AD^2 = AB * AC - BD * DC.7. Plugged in the values, simplified, and found that AD^2 = a b.So, AD = sqrt(a b).That seems correct. I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The length of ( AD ) is (boxed{sqrt{ab}})."},{"question":"Gavrila got on the train with a fully charged smartphone, and by the end of the trip, his smartphone was fully discharged.

Give the answer in kilometers, rounded to the nearest whole number if necessary.","answer":"Okay, let me try to figure this problem out step by step. So, Gavrila got on a train with a fully charged smartphone, and by the end of the trip, it was fully discharged. He spent half of the total time playing Tetris and the other half watching cartoons. We know that the smartphone completely discharges in 3 hours of video playback or 5 hours of playing Tetris. We need to find the distance he traveled, given that the train moved at an average speed of 80 km/h for half the way and 60 km/h for the other half.First, let me break down the information given:1. The smartphone discharges completely in 3 hours of video playback or 5 hours of Tetris. So, watching videos consumes battery faster than playing Tetris.2. Gavrila spent half of his total travel time on each activity: half playing Tetris, half watching cartoons.3. The train's speed was 80 km/h for half the distance and 60 km/h for the other half.Our goal is to find the total distance traveled.Hmm, okay. So, the first thing I need to figure out is how long the trip took. Because if I can find the total time, I can then use the average speeds to find the distance.But how do I find the total time? Well, the smartphone was fully discharged by the end of the trip, and we know how long each activity takes to discharge the phone completely. So, maybe we can model the battery consumption.Let me denote the total time of the trip as T hours. Then, Gavrila spent T/2 hours playing Tetris and T/2 hours watching cartoons.We know that playing Tetris for 5 hours discharges the phone completely, so the battery consumption rate for Tetris is 1/5 per hour. Similarly, watching videos consumes battery at a rate of 1/3 per hour.Therefore, the total battery consumed during the trip would be:Battery consumed = (T/2) * (1/5) + (T/2) * (1/3)Since the phone was fully discharged, the total battery consumed is 1 (representing 100% battery). So:(T/2)*(1/5) + (T/2)*(1/3) = 1Let me compute that:First, factor out T/2:T/2 * (1/5 + 1/3) = 1Compute 1/5 + 1/3. To add these, find a common denominator, which is 15.1/5 = 3/15 and 1/3 = 5/15, so 3/15 + 5/15 = 8/15.So, T/2 * (8/15) = 1Multiply both sides by 2:T * (8/15) = 2Then, solve for T:T = 2 * (15/8) = 30/8 = 15/4 = 3.75 hours.So, the total time of the trip was 3.75 hours.Now, we need to find the distance traveled. The train moved at 80 km/h for half the distance and 60 km/h for the other half. So, the distance is split into two equal parts, each part being D/2.Let me denote the total distance as D. Then, each half is D/2.The time taken for each half can be calculated as distance divided by speed.So, time for the first half: (D/2) / 80 = D / 160 hours.Time for the second half: (D/2) / 60 = D / 120 hours.Total time T is the sum of these two times:D / 160 + D / 120 = TWe already found that T is 3.75 hours, so:D / 160 + D / 120 = 3.75To solve for D, let's find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 160 and 120. The least common multiple of 160 and 120 is 480.Convert each fraction:D / 160 = (3D) / 480D / 120 = (4D) / 480So, adding them together:(3D + 4D) / 480 = 7D / 480 = 3.75So, 7D / 480 = 3.75Multiply both sides by 480:7D = 3.75 * 480Compute 3.75 * 480:First, 3 * 480 = 14400.75 * 480 = 360So, 1440 + 360 = 1800Therefore, 7D = 1800Divide both sides by 7:D = 1800 / 7 ≈ 257.142857 kmSo, approximately 257.142857 km. Rounded to the nearest whole number, that's 257 km.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, the battery consumption:(T/2)*(1/5 + 1/3) = 1Which simplifies to T/2*(8/15) = 1So, T = 2*(15/8) = 30/8 = 3.75 hours. That seems correct.Then, the distance calculation:Time = D/160 + D/120 = 3.75Convert to common denominator 480:3D/480 + 4D/480 = 7D/480 = 3.75So, 7D = 3.75 * 480 = 1800Thus, D = 1800 / 7 ≈ 257.142857, which is approximately 257 km. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way to verify.Let me denote the total distance as D. The train goes half the distance at 80 km/h and half at 60 km/h.So, time for first half: (D/2)/80 = D/(160)Time for second half: (D/2)/60 = D/(120)Total time: D/160 + D/120 = 3.75Let me compute D/160 + D/120:Find a common denominator, which is 480.So, D/160 = 3D/480D/120 = 4D/480Total: 7D/480 = 3.75Multiply both sides by 480:7D = 3.75 * 480Compute 3.75 * 480:3.75 is equal to 15/4, so 15/4 * 480 = (15 * 480)/4 = (15 * 120) = 1800So, 7D = 1800 => D = 1800 / 7 ≈ 257.142857Yes, that's consistent.So, the total distance is approximately 257.14 km, which rounds to 257 km.Therefore, the answer is 257 km.**Final Answer**The distance Gavrila traveled is boxed{257} kilometers."},{"question":"If for any real number x, we have x^3 = a + a_1(x-2) + a_2(x-2)^2 + a_3(x-2)^3, then the value of a_1 + a_2 + a_3 is.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: For any real number x, it's given that x³ can be expressed as a + a₁(x - 2) + a₂(x - 2)² + a₃(x - 2)³. I need to find the value of a₁ + a₂ + a₃. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when you have a polynomial expressed in terms of (x - c), it's called a Taylor series expansion or a shifted polynomial. In this case, it's centered at x = 2. So, essentially, they're expressing x³ as a polynomial centered at 2. That makes sense because any polynomial can be expressed in terms of another polynomial with a different center.So, if I recall correctly, the coefficients a, a₁, a₂, a₃ can be found using the derivatives of the function at the point x = 2. Let me write down the general formula for a Taylor series expansion. For a function f(x) expanded around x = c, it's:f(x) = f(c) + f'(c)(x - c) + (f''(c)/2!)(x - c)² + (f'''(c)/3!)(x - c)³ + ... In this problem, f(x) is x³, and c is 2. So, let's compute the necessary derivatives.First, f(x) = x³.Then, f'(x) = 3x².f''(x) = 6x.f'''(x) = 6.Okay, so now let's compute these derivatives at x = 2.f(2) = 2³ = 8.f'(2) = 3*(2)² = 3*4 = 12.f''(2) = 6*2 = 12.f'''(2) = 6.So, plugging these into the Taylor series expansion formula:f(x) = f(2) + f'(2)(x - 2) + (f''(2)/2!)(x - 2)² + (f'''(2)/3!)(x - 2)³.Let me compute each term:f(2) = 8.f'(2)(x - 2) = 12(x - 2).(f''(2)/2!)(x - 2)² = (12 / 2)(x - 2)² = 6(x - 2)².(f'''(2)/3!)(x - 2)³ = (6 / 6)(x - 2)³ = 1*(x - 2)³.So, putting it all together:x³ = 8 + 12(x - 2) + 6(x - 2)² + (x - 2)³.Wait, so comparing this to the given expression:x³ = a + a₁(x - 2) + a₂(x - 2)² + a₃(x - 2)³.So, that means:a = 8,a₁ = 12,a₂ = 6,a₃ = 1.So, the coefficients are 8, 12, 6, and 1.But the question asks for a₁ + a₂ + a₃. So, that would be 12 + 6 + 1.Let me compute that: 12 + 6 is 18, plus 1 is 19.Wait, 12 + 6 is 18? Hmm, no, 12 + 6 is actually 18, right? 10 + 6 is 16, plus 2 is 18. Then 18 + 1 is 19. Hmm, okay, so 19 is the sum.But let me double-check my work because sometimes when I do derivatives, I might make a mistake.So, f(x) = x³.f(2) = 8, that's correct.f'(x) = 3x², so f'(2) = 3*(4) = 12, that's correct.f''(x) = 6x, so f''(2) = 12, correct.f'''(x) = 6, so f'''(2) = 6, correct.Then, plugging into the Taylor series:8 + 12(x - 2) + (12/2)(x - 2)² + (6/6)(x - 2)³.Which simplifies to:8 + 12(x - 2) + 6(x - 2)² + 1*(x - 2)³.So, yes, a = 8, a₁ = 12, a₂ = 6, a₃ = 1.Therefore, a₁ + a₂ + a₃ is 12 + 6 + 1 = 19.Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem without using derivatives? Maybe by expanding the right-hand side and equating coefficients?Let me try that method as a verification.Given that x³ = a + a₁(x - 2) + a₂(x - 2)² + a₃(x - 2)³.Let me expand the right-hand side step by step.First, expand (x - 2)³:(x - 2)³ = x³ - 6x² + 12x - 8.Similarly, (x - 2)² = x² - 4x + 4.And (x - 2) is just x - 2.So, let's substitute these into the right-hand side:a + a₁(x - 2) + a₂(x - 2)² + a₃(x - 2)³= a + a₁(x - 2) + a₂(x² - 4x + 4) + a₃(x³ - 6x² + 12x - 8).Now, let's distribute the coefficients:= a + a₁x - 2a₁ + a₂x² - 4a₂x + 4a₂ + a₃x³ - 6a₃x² + 12a₃x - 8a₃.Now, let's collect like terms:- The x³ term: a₃x³.- The x² term: a₂x² - 6a₃x² = (a₂ - 6a₃)x².- The x term: a₁x - 4a₂x + 12a₃x = (a₁ - 4a₂ + 12a₃)x.- The constant term: a - 2a₁ + 4a₂ - 8a₃.So, putting it all together:Right-hand side = a₃x³ + (a₂ - 6a₃)x² + (a₁ - 4a₂ + 12a₃)x + (a - 2a₁ + 4a₂ - 8a₃).Now, the left-hand side is x³, which can be written as:x³ + 0x² + 0x + 0.Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of x on both sides.So, equating coefficients:1. For x³: a₃ = 1.2. For x²: a₂ - 6a₃ = 0.3. For x: a₁ - 4a₂ + 12a₃ = 0.4. For the constant term: a - 2a₁ + 4a₂ - 8a₃ = 0.So, let's solve these equations step by step.From equation 1: a₃ = 1.From equation 2: a₂ - 6a₃ = 0. Since a₃ = 1, this becomes a₂ - 6*1 = 0 => a₂ = 6.From equation 3: a₁ - 4a₂ + 12a₃ = 0. Substituting a₂ = 6 and a₃ = 1:a₁ - 4*6 + 12*1 = 0 => a₁ - 24 + 12 = 0 => a₁ - 12 = 0 => a₁ = 12.From equation 4: a - 2a₁ + 4a₂ - 8a₃ = 0. Substituting a₁ = 12, a₂ = 6, a₃ = 1:a - 2*12 + 4*6 - 8*1 = 0 => a - 24 + 24 - 8 = 0 => a - 8 = 0 => a = 8.So, this confirms the earlier result: a = 8, a₁ = 12, a₂ = 6, a₃ = 1.Therefore, a₁ + a₂ + a₃ = 12 + 6 + 1 = 19.Wait, so both methods give me the same result. That makes me more confident that 19 is the correct answer.But just to make sure, let me plug in a specific value of x to test the equation.Let's choose x = 2, since it's the center of the expansion. If x = 2, then the right-hand side becomes a + a₁(0) + a₂(0) + a₃(0) = a. The left-hand side is 2³ = 8. So, a must be 8, which matches our result.Let me try another value, say x = 3.Left-hand side: 3³ = 27.Right-hand side: a + a₁(3 - 2) + a₂(3 - 2)² + a₃(3 - 2)³ = a + a₁(1) + a₂(1) + a₃(1) = a + a₁ + a₂ + a₃.We know a = 8, a₁ = 12, a₂ = 6, a₃ = 1. So, 8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27. Which matches the left-hand side. Perfect.Let me try x = 1.Left-hand side: 1³ = 1.Right-hand side: a + a₁(1 - 2) + a₂(1 - 2)² + a₃(1 - 2)³.Compute each term:a = 8.a₁(1 - 2) = 12*(-1) = -12.a₂(1 - 2)² = 6*(1) = 6.a₃(1 - 2)³ = 1*(-1)³ = -1.So, adding them up: 8 - 12 + 6 - 1 = (8 - 12) + (6 - 1) = (-4) + (5) = 1. Which matches the left-hand side. Nice.Therefore, all the coefficients are correct, and the sum a₁ + a₂ + a₃ is indeed 19.I think I've thoroughly checked this problem using two different methods and even tested specific values to confirm. So, I'm confident that the answer is 19.**Final Answer**The value of (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) is boxed{19}."},{"question":"Gerald had 20 toy cars. He donated 1/4 of his toy cars to an orphanage. How many toy cars does Gerald have left?","answer":"First, determine how many toy cars Gerald donated by calculating one-fourth of 20.Next, subtract the donated cars from the original number to find out how many toy cars Gerald has left."},{"question":"Rotations at 60^circ and 120^circ","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about rotations at 60 degrees and 120 degrees. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure out what exactly is being asked here. Rotations in geometry usually refer to turning a shape around a fixed point, called the center of rotation, by a certain angle. So, if we're talking about rotations at 60° and 120°, I guess we're dealing with transformations where a figure is rotated by these specific angles.First, I need to recall what a rotation does. When you rotate a figure, each point of the figure moves along a circular path around the center of rotation. The angle of rotation determines how much each point moves around that circle. So, a 60° rotation would move each point 60 degrees around the center, and a 120° rotation would move them 120 degrees.I wonder if the problem is asking about the composition of these rotations. Like, if you rotate a figure by 60° and then by another 120°, what's the overall effect? Or maybe it's about the properties of figures that can be rotated by these angles and still look the same, like regular polygons.Wait, regular polygons have rotational symmetry, meaning they can be rotated by certain angles and still look identical. For example, an equilateral triangle has rotational symmetry of 120°, because if you rotate it by 120°, it looks the same. Similarly, a regular hexagon has rotational symmetry of 60°, since each rotation of 60° brings it back to its original position.So, maybe the problem is about identifying which regular polygons have rotational symmetry at 60° and 120°. Let me think. For a regular polygon with n sides, the angle of rotational symmetry is 360° divided by n. So, if the angle is 60°, then n would be 360° / 60° = 6. That means a regular hexagon has 60° rotational symmetry. Similarly, for 120°, n would be 360° / 120° = 3, so an equilateral triangle has 120° rotational symmetry.But the problem mentions both 60° and 120° rotations. Maybe it's asking about the relationship between these two rotations? Like, if you perform a 60° rotation twice, you get a 120° rotation. So, composing two 60° rotations gives a 120° rotation. That makes sense because 60° + 60° = 120°. Alternatively, if you perform a 120° rotation, it's equivalent to two 60° rotations.Wait, but in group theory, the set of rotations forms a group under composition. So, if you have a rotation by 60°, the group generated by this rotation would include all multiples of 60°, which are 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°, and 360°, which brings you back to the starting position. So, the rotations by 60° and 120° are elements of this cyclic group of order 6.But maybe the problem is more about the effect of these rotations on specific figures or coordinates. Let me consider a coordinate system. If I rotate a point (x, y) by 60°, the new coordinates can be found using the rotation matrix:[ begin{pmatrix}costheta & -sintheta sintheta & costhetaend{pmatrix}]So, for θ = 60°, cos(60°) = 0.5 and sin(60°) = (√3)/2. Therefore, the rotation matrix is:[ begin{pmatrix}0.5 & -sqrt{3}/2 sqrt{3}/2 & 0.5end{pmatrix}]Similarly, for θ = 120°, cos(120°) = -0.5 and sin(120°) = (√3)/2. So, the rotation matrix is:[ begin{pmatrix}-0.5 & -sqrt{3}/2 sqrt{3}/2 & -0.5end{pmatrix}]If I apply these matrices to a point, say (1, 0), rotating it by 60° would give (0.5, √3/2), and rotating it by 120° would give (-0.5, √3/2). Interesting, so each rotation moves the point further around the unit circle.But perhaps the problem is about combining these rotations. If I rotate a figure by 60° and then by another 120°, the total rotation would be 180°, right? Because 60° + 120° = 180°. So, the composition of a 60° rotation and a 120° rotation is a 180° rotation.Wait, but in group theory terms, the composition depends on the order. If I first rotate by 60° and then by 120°, it's equivalent to a rotation by 180°. But if I rotate by 120° first and then by 60°, it's also equivalent to 180°, because rotation is commutative in this case? Hmm, no, actually, in 2D rotations, the composition is commutative because rotating by θ1 and then θ2 is the same as rotating by θ2 and then θ1. So, yes, both orders give a 180° rotation.Alternatively, if I compose a 60° rotation three times, I get 180°, and composing it six times brings me back to 360°, which is the identity rotation. Similarly, composing a 120° rotation three times gives 360°, which is the identity.Wait, so the order of the rotation by 60° is 6, meaning you need six such rotations to get back to the starting position. The order of the rotation by 120° is 3, since three rotations bring you back.So, in terms of group theory, the cyclic group generated by a 60° rotation has six elements: rotations by 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°. Similarly, the cyclic group generated by a 120° rotation has three elements: 0°, 120°, and 240°. So, the 120° rotation is actually an element of the larger group generated by 60° rotations.This makes me think that the 120° rotation is a subgroup of the 60° rotation group. Specifically, the subgroup generated by 120° rotations is a cyclic subgroup of order 3 within the cyclic group of order 6.But maybe the problem is more about the visual effect. If I have a figure and I rotate it by 60°, then by 120°, how does it look? Well, as I thought earlier, it's equivalent to a 180° rotation. So, the figure would be flipped halfway around.Alternatively, if I have a figure with both 60° and 120° rotational symmetry, what does that imply? Well, if a figure has 60° rotational symmetry, it must also have 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300° rotational symmetries, because those are multiples of 60°. So, having 60° symmetry automatically gives you 120° symmetry as well.But if a figure only has 120° rotational symmetry, it doesn't necessarily have 60° symmetry. For example, an equilateral triangle has 120° rotational symmetry but not 60°, because rotating it by 60° would not map it onto itself.So, maybe the problem is about understanding the relationship between these two angles in terms of symmetry. If a figure has 60° rotational symmetry, it's more symmetric than one with only 120° symmetry.Alternatively, if we're talking about the composition of rotations, like in transformations, combining a 60° and a 120° rotation can result in different transformations depending on the order or the center of rotation. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'm assuming it's about the effect on the same center.Wait, another thought: in 3D rotations, things get more complicated because rotations don't commute, but in 2D, they do. So, in 2D, the composition of two rotations is another rotation by the sum of the angles. So, 60° + 120° = 180°, as I thought earlier.But what if the rotations are about different centers? Then the composition might not just be a simple rotation. It could be a translation or another rotation. But again, the problem doesn't specify different centers, so I think we can assume the same center.Let me try to visualize this. If I have a point at (1, 0) and I rotate it 60° around the origin, it moves to (0.5, √3/2). Then, rotating that point another 120° around the origin would move it to (-0.5, √3/2). Alternatively, if I first rotate 120°, the point goes to (-0.5, √3/2), and then rotating 60° would bring it to (-1, 0). Wait, that's different.Wait, hold on, no. Let me recast that. If I have a point (1, 0). First, rotate 60°: becomes (0.5, √3/2). Then, rotate that 120°: let's apply the rotation matrix for 120° to (0.5, √3/2).Using the 120° rotation matrix:x' = -0.5 * 0.5 - (√3/2) * (√3/2) = -0.25 - (3/4) = -1y' = (√3/2) * 0.5 + (-0.5) * (√3/2) = (√3/4) - (√3/4) = 0So, the point becomes (-1, 0). Alternatively, if I first rotate 120°, the point (1, 0) becomes (-0.5, √3/2). Then, rotating 60°:x' = 0.5 * (-0.5) - (√3/2) * (√3/2) = -0.25 - 0.75 = -1y' = (√3/2) * (-0.5) + 0.5 * (√3/2) = (-√3/4) + (√3/4) = 0So, same result: (-1, 0). So, regardless of the order, the composition of a 60° and a 120° rotation around the same center results in a 180° rotation. That makes sense because rotation is commutative in 2D.So, in that case, the composition is a 180° rotation. So, maybe the problem is asking about the composition of these two rotations and what the resulting transformation is.Alternatively, if the problem is about the effect on a specific figure, like a triangle or a hexagon, then the rotations would map the figure onto itself. For example, rotating an equilateral triangle by 120° maps it onto itself, but rotating it by 60° does not. Whereas a regular hexagon can be rotated by 60° and still look the same.Wait, so if I have a regular hexagon, rotating it by 60°, 120°, etc., all map it onto itself. So, the hexagon has rotational symmetry of order 6, meaning it can be rotated by 60° increments. Whereas the triangle has rotational symmetry of order 3, so only 120° increments.So, maybe the problem is about identifying the order of rotational symmetry for figures given these angles. Or perhaps it's about the relationship between these angles in terms of their least common multiple or something.Wait, 60° and 120°, their least common multiple is 120°, but I'm not sure that's relevant here.Alternatively, if we're talking about the combination of two rotations, one by 60° and another by 120°, but about different centers, then the composition might not be a pure rotation. It could be a translation or another rotation, depending on the centers.But since the problem doesn't specify different centers, I think it's safe to assume they're about the same center.Wait, another angle to consider: in complex numbers, rotations can be represented as multiplication by e^{iθ}. So, a 60° rotation is multiplication by e^{iπ/3}, and a 120° rotation is multiplication by e^{i2π/3}. Composing these would be multiplying the two complex numbers: e^{iπ/3} * e^{i2π/3} = e^{iπ} = -1, which corresponds to a 180° rotation. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.So, in complex plane terms, the composition is a 180° rotation.Alternatively, if you have two rotations, one by 60° and another by 120°, their composition is a rotation by 180°, regardless of the order, because multiplication of complex numbers is commutative.So, that's another way to see it.But maybe the problem is more about the properties of these rotations in terms of their angles. For example, 60° is a divisor of 120°, in the sense that 120° is 2*60°. So, 60° is a \\"smaller\\" rotation, and 120° is a multiple of it.In terms of group theory, the cyclic group generated by 60° rotations includes 120° rotations as elements, but the group generated by 120° rotations is a proper subgroup of the larger group.So, perhaps the problem is about understanding the subgroup structure or the relationship between these two angles in terms of their rotational symmetries.Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the number of distinct rotations you can get by combining 60° and 120° rotations. Since 60° and 120° are both multiples of 60°, their combinations can only give multiples of 60°, which are 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°, and 360°, which is the identity.So, the set of all such rotations forms a cyclic group of order 6.But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is getting at.Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the minimal angle needed to generate both 60° and 120° rotations. Since 60° is the minimal angle here, because 120° is just two 60° rotations.So, the minimal angle that can generate both is 60°, because 60° can generate 120°, but 120° cannot generate 60°.Wait, that's an interesting point. If you have a rotation by 120°, you can't get a rotation by 60° by composing it with itself, because 120° + 120° = 240°, and 240° + 120° = 360°, which is the identity. So, you can't get 60° from 120° rotations.But if you have a 60° rotation, you can get 120° by composing it twice.So, in terms of generating sets, 60° is a generator for a larger group, whereas 120° is a generator for a smaller subgroup.So, perhaps the problem is about understanding which rotation can generate the other, or the relationship between their orders.Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the number of distinct positions a figure can take under these rotations. For example, if you have a figure that can be rotated by 60°, it can take 6 distinct positions before repeating. If it can only be rotated by 120°, it can take 3 distinct positions.So, the number of distinct rotational positions is inversely related to the angle of rotation. Smaller angles allow for more distinct positions.But again, without more context, it's hard to know exactly what the problem is asking.Wait, the original problem was just \\"Rotations at 60° and 120°\\". Maybe it's a prompt for a problem, not a question. So, perhaps the user is expecting me to explain or provide information about rotations at these angles.Given that, I should probably explain what rotations at 60° and 120° mean, their properties, how they relate to each other, their applications in geometry, etc.So, starting from the basics, a rotation in geometry is a transformation that turns a figure about a fixed point called the center of rotation. The amount of turn is measured by the angle of rotation, which can be clockwise or counterclockwise.When we talk about rotations at 60° and 120°, we're referring to specific angles of rotation. These angles are significant because they are commonly associated with regular polygons. For instance, an equilateral triangle has rotational symmetry of 120°, meaning it can be rotated by 120° and still look the same. Similarly, a regular hexagon has rotational symmetry of 60°, as it can be rotated by 60° increments and still appear unchanged.The key properties of these rotations include:1. **Order of Rotation**: The order of a rotation is the number of times you need to apply it to return to the original position. For a 60° rotation, the order is 6 because 6 * 60° = 360°. For a 120° rotation, the order is 3 because 3 * 120° = 360°.2. **Commutativity**: In two dimensions, rotations about the same center are commutative. This means that rotating by 60° and then 120° is the same as rotating by 120° and then 60°. The result is a rotation by the sum of the angles, which in this case is 180°.3. **Group Structure**: The set of all rotations about a fixed point in the plane forms a group under composition. Specifically, the rotations by multiples of 60° form a cyclic group of order 6. Within this group, the rotations by multiples of 120° form a subgroup of order 3.4. **Symmetry**: Figures with rotational symmetry of 60° or 120° are common in art, architecture, and nature. For example, hexagonal crystals in nature often exhibit 60° rotational symmetry, while three-bladed propellers might have 120° rotational symmetry.5. **Matrix Representation**: In coordinate geometry, rotations can be represented using rotation matrices. For a 60° rotation, the matrix is:   [   begin{pmatrix}   cos 60° & -sin 60°    sin 60° & cos 60°   end{pmatrix}   =   begin{pmatrix}   0.5 & -sqrt{3}/2    sqrt{3}/2 & 0.5   end{pmatrix}   ]   For a 120° rotation, the matrix is:   [   begin{pmatrix}   cos 120° & -sin 120°    sin 120° & cos 120°   end{pmatrix}   =   begin{pmatrix}   -0.5 & -sqrt{3}/2    sqrt{3}/2 & -0.5   end{pmatrix}   ]6. **Composition of Rotations**: As mentioned earlier, composing a 60° rotation and a 120° rotation results in a 180° rotation. This can be seen by adding the angles since rotations about the same center commute.7. **Applications**: Understanding rotations is essential in various fields, including computer graphics, physics, and engineering. For example, in computer graphics, rotations are used to animate objects in 3D space. In physics, rotations are fundamental in understanding the motion of rigid bodies.8. **Connection to Complex Numbers**: Rotations can also be represented using complex numbers. A rotation by θ degrees can be represented as multiplication by e^{iθ}. For 60°, this is e^{iπ/3}, and for 120°, it's e^{i2π/3}. Composing these rotations corresponds to multiplying the complex numbers, which again results in a rotation by the sum of the angles.9. **Visualizing Rotations**: To better understand rotations, it's helpful to visualize them. For instance, if you have a point at (1, 0) on a coordinate plane, rotating it 60° counterclockwise around the origin will move it to (0.5, √3/2). Rotating it another 120° will move it to (-0.5, √3/2), and so on. This demonstrates how each rotation moves the point along the circumference of a circle centered at the origin.10. **Symmetry Groups**: The concept of rotational symmetry is closely tied to group theory, where the set of all symmetries of a figure (including rotations and reflections) forms a group. For example, the symmetry group of a regular hexagon includes rotations by 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°, as well as reflections over its axes of symmetry.In summary, rotations at 60° and 120° are fundamental transformations in geometry with wide-ranging applications. They are essential in understanding the symmetries of regular polygons, form the basis of cyclic groups in group theory, and have practical uses in fields such as computer graphics and physics. By exploring their properties, compositions, and representations, we gain a deeper insight into the structure and transformations of geometric figures.**Final Answer**The composition of a 60° rotation and a 120° rotation results in a boxed{180^circ} rotation."},{"question":"In bridge, a standard 52-card deck is dealt to 4 players.

Let me try to understand it step by step. In bridge, each player gets 13 cards from a standard 52-card deck. The points for a hand are calculated using a specific formula: 4 points for each Ace, 3 points for each King, 2 points for each Queen, and 1 point for each Jack. So, the formula is:[ 4 times (# text{A's}) + 3 times (# text{K's}) + 2 times (# text{Q's}) + 1 times (# text{J's}) ]The problem states that a particular hand has exactly 4 cards that are A, K, Q, or J. I need to find the probability that its point value is 13 or higher.First, let me break down the problem. We know that the hand has exactly 4 honor cards (A, K, Q, J). So, out of these 4 cards, some are Aces, some are Kings, some are Queens, and some are Jacks. The rest of the 9 cards in the hand are non-honor cards (2 through 10). Our goal is to find the probability that the total points from these 4 honor cards are 13 or higher. So, I need to figure out all the possible combinations of A, K, Q, J in 4 cards that sum up to 13 or more points, and then divide that by the total number of possible combinations of 4 honor cards.Let me structure this:1. **Total number of possible 4-card honor combinations:**   There are 4 suits, each with an Ace, King, Queen, and Jack. So, in total, there are 16 honor cards (4 Aces, 4 Kings, 4 Queens, 4 Jacks). We need to choose 4 of these 16. So, the total number of possible combinations is C(16,4).2. **Number of favorable combinations:**   We need to count how many ways we can choose 4 honor cards such that their total points are 13 or higher.So, let me compute the total number of combinations first.Calculating C(16,4):[ C(16,4) = frac{16!}{4! times (16-4)!} = frac{16 times 15 times 14 times 13}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 1820 ]So, there are 1820 possible 4-card honor combinations.Now, I need to find how many of these combinations give a point total of 13 or more.Let me think about how to approach this. Since each honor card has a different point value, the total points depend on how many of each type (A, K, Q, J) we have in the 4-card combination.Let me denote:- a = number of Aces (each worth 4 points)- k = number of Kings (each worth 3 points)- q = number of Queens (each worth 2 points)- j = number of Jacks (each worth 1 point)We have the constraints:- a + k + q + j = 4 (since we have 4 honor cards)- 4a + 3k + 2q + j ≥ 13 (since we need the total points to be 13 or higher)Our variables a, k, q, j are non-negative integers.So, we need to find all possible (a, k, q, j) tuples that satisfy these two equations.Let me consider the possible values of a, since Aces give the highest points, so having more Aces will contribute more to the total points.Possible values for a: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4Let me go through each possible value of a and see what combinations are possible.**Case 1: a = 4**- Then, k = q = j = 0- Total points: 4*4 + 3*0 + 2*0 + 1*0 = 16- 16 ≥ 13, so this is favorable.- Number of combinations: C(4,4) * C(4,0) * C(4,0) * C(4,0) = 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1**Case 2: a = 3**- Then, we have 1 more honor card to choose (k + q + j = 1)- Let's see the possible points:  - If the 4th card is a King: 4*3 + 3*1 = 12 + 3 = 15  - If it's a Queen: 12 + 2 = 14  - If it's a Jack: 12 + 1 = 13  - All of these are ≥13- So, all combinations where a=3 and any one of K, Q, J are favorable.- Number of combinations:  - Choose 3 Aces: C(4,3)  - Choose 1 honor card from the remaining 12 (since 4 Aces are already chosen, but wait, actually, the remaining honor cards are 12 (4 K, 4 Q, 4 J). But since we have a=3, we have already chosen 3 Aces, so the remaining 1 card can be any of the 12 non-Ace honor cards.  - So, number of combinations: C(4,3) * C(12,1) = 4 * 12 = 48Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because when a=3, we have 3 Aces, and then 1 more honor card which can be K, Q, or J. Since there are 4 K, 4 Q, and 4 J, that's 12 cards. So, yes, 48 combinations.**Case 3: a = 2**- Now, we have 2 Aces, so total points from Aces: 8- We need the remaining 2 honor cards to contribute at least 5 points (since 8 + 5 = 13)- Let me denote the remaining points needed: 5- Let me denote the remaining two cards as x and y, which can be K, Q, or J- So, 3x + 3y + 2x + 2y + 1x + 1y? Wait, no.Wait, actually, each of the remaining two cards can be K, Q, or J, each contributing 3, 2, or 1 points respectively.So, the total points from the two remaining cards should be ≥5.Let me denote the points from the two cards as p1 and p2, where p1 and p2 can be 3, 2, or 1.We need p1 + p2 ≥5.Possible combinations:- (3,3): 6 points- (3,2): 5 points- (3,1): 4 points (not enough)- (2,2): 4 points (not enough)- (2,1): 3 points (not enough)- (1,1): 2 points (not enough)So, the favorable combinations are (3,3) and (3,2). Note that (3,2) can be in two orders, but since we are choosing two distinct cards, we need to consider whether they are from different ranks or the same.Wait, actually, in terms of combinations, the two cards can be:- Two Kings: (3,3)- One King and one Queen: (3,2)- One King and one Jack: (3,1)- Two Queens: (2,2)- One Queen and one Jack: (2,1)- Two Jacks: (1,1)But we only need the ones where the total points are ≥5, which are:- Two Kings: 6 points- One King and one Queen: 5 pointsSo, the favorable combinations are:1. Two Kings2. One King and one QueenNow, let's compute the number of such combinations.First, number of ways to choose 2 Kings:There are 4 Kings, so C(4,2) = 6Number of ways to choose 1 King and 1 Queen:C(4,1) * C(4,1) = 4 * 4 = 16So, total favorable combinations for the two remaining cards: 6 + 16 = 22But wait, hold on. Is that correct?Wait, actually, when a=2, we have already chosen 2 Aces. So, the remaining two honor cards can be any of the remaining 12 honor cards (since 4 Aces are in the deck, but we've already chosen 2, so the remaining honor cards are 12: 4 K, 4 Q, 4 J). So, the number of ways to choose 2 honor cards from these 12 is C(12,2) = 66.But we need only those combinations where the two cards give a total of at least 5 points. So, as calculated above, the favorable combinations are 22.But wait, let me make sure.Wait, actually, when we have two honor cards, the number of ways to get two Kings is C(4,2)=6, and the number of ways to get one King and one Queen is C(4,1)*C(4,1)=16. So, total 22.Therefore, the number of favorable combinations when a=2 is:Number of ways to choose 2 Aces * number of favorable combinations for the remaining two cards.So, C(4,2) * 22 = 6 * 22 = 132Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Because when a=2, we have already fixed the number of Aces, so the total number of combinations is:C(4,2) * C(12,2). But we are only interested in the cases where the remaining two cards give at least 5 points. So, the number of favorable combinations is C(4,2) * (number of favorable two-card combinations from the 12). So, as above, 6 * 22 = 132.Wait, but hold on. Wait, no, the 22 is already the number of favorable two-card combinations from the 12. So, actually, it's 6 * 22? Wait, no, no. Wait, C(4,2) is the number of ways to choose the Aces, and then for each such choice, we have 22 ways to choose the remaining two honor cards that give at least 5 points. So, yes, 6 * 22 = 132.Wait, but hold on, that would be 6 * 22 = 132, but 22 is the number of two-card combinations from the 12 that give at least 5 points. So, yes, that seems correct.Wait, but let me think again. The total number of two-card combinations from the 12 is 66, and the number of favorable is 22, so the probability for a=2 is 22/66 = 1/3, but we are counting the actual number of combinations, not probability. So, 22 combinations for each choice of Aces.But actually, no, because the 22 is the number of two-card combinations from the 12, so when multiplied by the number of ways to choose the Aces, which is 6, we get 6*22=132.Yes, that seems correct.**Case 4: a = 1**- Now, we have 1 Ace, contributing 4 points.- We need the remaining 3 honor cards to contribute at least 9 points (since 4 + 9 = 13)- So, the total points from the remaining 3 cards should be ≥9- Let me denote the points from these 3 cards as p1 + p2 + p3 ≥9- Each pi can be 3, 2, or 1So, we need to find all combinations of 3 honor cards (K, Q, J) such that their total points are ≥9.Let me think about the possible combinations.Let me denote the number of Kings, Queens, and Jacks in the remaining 3 cards as k, q, j, with k + q + j = 3.Total points: 3k + 2q + j ≥9We need to find all (k, q, j) such that k + q + j = 3 and 3k + 2q + j ≥9.Let me list all possible (k, q, j) triplets:Possible k: 0,1,2,3For each k, find possible q and j.**Subcase 4.1: k=3**- Then q=0, j=0- Total points: 9- 9 ≥9, so this is favorable- Number of combinations: C(4,3) = 4**Subcase 4.2: k=2**- Then q + j =1- Total points: 6 + 2q + j- Since q + j =1, possible (q,j): (1,0) or (0,1)  - For (1,0): total points =6 +2=8 <9, not favorable  - For (0,1): total points=6 +1=7 <9, not favorable- So, no favorable combinations here**Subcase 4.3: k=1**- Then q + j =2- Total points: 3 + 2q + j- We need 3 + 2q + j ≥9 => 2q + j ≥6- Since q + j =2, let's substitute j=2 - q- So, 2q + (2 - q) ≥6 => q + 2 ≥6 => q ≥4- But q can be at most 2 (since q + j =2)- So, no solution here- Therefore, no favorable combinations**Subcase 4.4: k=0**- Then q + j =3- Total points: 0 + 2q + j- We need 2q + j ≥9- Since q + j =3, substitute j=3 - q- So, 2q + (3 - q) ≥9 => q + 3 ≥9 => q ≥6- But q can be at most 3 (since q + j =3)- So, no solution here- Therefore, no favorable combinationsSo, the only favorable subcase when a=1 is when k=3, which gives 4 combinations.Therefore, the number of favorable combinations when a=1 is:Number of ways to choose 1 Ace * number of ways to choose 3 KingsWhich is C(4,1) * C(4,3) = 4 * 4 = 16Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Because when a=1, we have 1 Ace, and then we need to choose 3 Kings. But the remaining honor cards are 12 (since 4 Aces, but we've chosen 1, so 3 Aces left, but wait, no. Wait, when a=1, we have 1 Ace, and the remaining 3 honor cards must be Kings, Queens, or Jacks. But in this case, only when k=3, q=0, j=0, which is 3 Kings.So, the number of ways is:C(4,1) * C(4,3) = 4 * 4 = 16Yes, that's correct.**Case 5: a = 0**- Now, we have 0 Aces, so all 4 honor cards are K, Q, or J- Total points needed: ≥13- Let me denote k, q, j such that k + q + j =4- Total points: 3k + 2q + j ≥13We need to find all (k, q, j) with k + q + j =4 and 3k + 2q + j ≥13Let me approach this similarly by considering possible k values.Possible k: 0,1,2,3,4**Subcase 5.1: k=4**- Then q=0, j=0- Total points: 12- 12 <13, so not favorable**Subcase 5.2: k=3**- Then q + j =1- Total points: 9 + 2q + j- We need 9 + 2q + j ≥13 => 2q + j ≥4- Since q + j =1, possible (q,j): (1,0) or (0,1)  - (1,0): 2*1 +0=2 <4, not favorable  - (0,1): 2*0 +1=1 <4, not favorable- So, no favorable combinations**Subcase 5.3: k=2**- Then q + j =2- Total points: 6 + 2q + j- We need 6 + 2q + j ≥13 => 2q + j ≥7- Since q + j =2, substitute j=2 - q- So, 2q + (2 - q) ≥7 => q + 2 ≥7 => q ≥5- But q can be at most 2, so no solution- No favorable combinations**Subcase 5.4: k=1**- Then q + j =3- Total points: 3 + 2q + j- We need 3 + 2q + j ≥13 => 2q + j ≥10- Since q + j =3, substitute j=3 - q- So, 2q + (3 - q) ≥10 => q + 3 ≥10 => q ≥7- But q can be at most 3, so no solution- No favorable combinations**Subcase 5.5: k=0**- Then q + j =4- Total points: 0 + 2q + j- We need 2q + j ≥13- Since q + j =4, substitute j=4 - q- So, 2q + (4 - q) ≥13 => q + 4 ≥13 => q ≥9- But q can be at most 4, so no solution- No favorable combinationsSo, in this case, when a=0, there are no favorable combinations where the total points are ≥13.Therefore, the only favorable cases are when a=4, a=3, a=2, and a=1.Wait, but when a=1, we had only 16 favorable combinations, right? Let me recap:- a=4: 1 combination- a=3: 48 combinations- a=2: 132 combinations- a=1: 16 combinations- a=0: 0 combinationsSo, total favorable combinations: 1 + 48 + 132 + 16 = 197Wait, 1 + 48 is 49, plus 132 is 181, plus 16 is 197.So, total favorable combinations: 197Total possible combinations: 1820Therefore, the probability is 197 / 1820But let me double-check my calculations because 197 seems a bit low.Wait, let me recount:- a=4: 1- a=3: 48- a=2: 132- a=1: 16- Total: 1 + 48 = 49; 49 + 132 = 181; 181 +16=197Yes, that's correct.Wait, but let me think again about the a=2 case. When a=2, we have 2 Aces, and then 2 other honor cards. We found that the number of favorable combinations is 22 for the two cards, but then multiplied by C(4,2)=6, giving 132. Is that correct?Wait, no, actually, hold on. When a=2, the number of ways to choose 2 Aces is C(4,2)=6. Then, for each such choice, the number of ways to choose 2 honor cards from the remaining 12 (which are 4 K, 4 Q, 4 J) such that their total points are ≥5.Earlier, I calculated that the number of such two-card combinations is 22. So, 6 * 22 = 132.But wait, is 22 the correct number of two-card combinations from 12 that give ≥5 points?Wait, let me recalculate.From the 12 honor cards (4 K, 4 Q, 4 J), how many two-card combinations give ≥5 points.Each card can be K(3), Q(2), J(1).Total points from two cards: p1 + p2 ≥5Possible combinations:- (K, K): 3 + 3 =6- (K, Q): 3 + 2=5- (K, J): 3 +1=4- (Q, Q):2 +2=4- (Q, J):2 +1=3- (J, J):1 +1=2So, the favorable combinations are:- (K, K): C(4,2)=6- (K, Q): C(4,1)*C(4,1)=16- (K, J): Not favorable- (Q, Q): Not favorable- (Q, J): Not favorable- (J, J): Not favorableSo, total favorable two-card combinations: 6 + 16 =22Yes, that's correct. So, 22 two-card combinations.Therefore, 6 * 22 =132 is correct.Similarly, for a=3, we had 48 combinations, which is C(4,3)*C(12,1)=4*12=48.For a=4, 1 combination.For a=1, 16 combinations.So, total favorable:197Total possible:1820So, probability is 197/1820Simplify this fraction:Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(197,1820). Let's compute GCD(197,1820).1820 ÷197=9 with remainder 1820 -197*9=1820-1773=47Now, GCD(197,47)197 ÷47=4 with remainder 197 -47*4=197-188=9GCD(47,9)47 ÷9=5 with remainder 47 -45=2GCD(9,2)9 ÷2=4 with remainder 1GCD(2,1)=1So, GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction cannot be simplified.So, the probability is 197/1820.But let me check if I haven't missed any cases.Wait, in the a=2 case, I considered two-card combinations from the 12, but actually, when a=2, the remaining two honor cards are chosen from the 12, but are they from the same suit or different suits? Wait, no, in bridge, the honor cards are from different suits, but in this case, we are just choosing any honor cards regardless of suits. So, the calculation is correct because we are considering all possible combinations, regardless of suits.Wait, another thought: when choosing honor cards, the number of ways to choose 4 honor cards is C(16,4)=1820, which is correct.But when a=4, we have only 1 combination, which is choosing all 4 Aces. Correct.When a=3, we have C(4,3)=4 ways to choose the Aces, and then 12 ways to choose the remaining honor card, giving 4*12=48. Correct.When a=2, 6 ways to choose the Aces, and 22 ways to choose the remaining two honor cards, giving 6*22=132. Correct.When a=1, 4 ways to choose the Ace, and 4 ways to choose 3 Kings, giving 4*4=16. Correct.When a=0, no combinations give total points ≥13. Correct.So, total favorable:197Total possible:1820Therefore, probability is 197/1820≈0.1082, or about 10.82%.Wait, but let me think again. Is 197 the correct count?Wait, let me think about another approach. Maybe using generating functions or something else.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the a=2 case.Wait, when a=2, the remaining two cards can be any combination of K, Q, J, but we need their total points to be ≥5.Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I considered that the two cards must sum to ≥5, which is correct.But let me think about the number of combinations again.Total two-card combinations from 12 honor cards: C(12,2)=66Number of favorable combinations:22So, 22/66=1/3. So, 1/3 of the two-card combinations give ≥5 points.But wait, in reality, the number of two-card combinations that give ≥5 points is 22, as calculated.But let me think about the number of two-card combinations:- Number of (K, K): C(4,2)=6- Number of (K, Q): C(4,1)*C(4,1)=16- Number of (K, J): C(4,1)*C(4,1)=16- Number of (Q, Q): C(4,2)=6- Number of (Q, J): C(4,1)*C(4,1)=16- Number of (J, J): C(4,2)=6Wait, hold on, that's 6 +16 +16 +6 +16 +6=66, which is correct.But in terms of points:- (K, K):6- (K, Q):5- (K, J):4- (Q, Q):4- (Q, J):3- (J, J):2So, the favorable ones are (K, K) and (K, Q), which are 6 +16=22, as before.So, that seems correct.Therefore, the number of favorable combinations when a=2 is 6*22=132.So, I think my calculations are correct.Therefore, the probability is 197/1820.But let me check if 197 is correct.Wait, 1 +48=49, 49 +132=181, 181 +16=197. Yes, that's correct.So, the probability is 197/1820.Simplify:Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(197,1820)=1, so it's 197/1820.Alternatively, as a decimal, 197 ÷1820≈0.1082, or 10.82%.But the problem asks for the probability, so we can present it as a fraction.But let me see if 197 is a prime number. 197 is a prime number because it's not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13. 13*15=195, so 197 is prime.Therefore, 197/1820 is the simplest form.But wait, let me check 197*9=1773, 1820-1773=47, which is prime, so yes, GCD is 1.Therefore, the probability is 197/1820.But let me think again. Is 197 the correct count?Wait, another way to compute is to think in terms of the point values.Given that we have 4 honor cards, each worth 4,3,2,1.We need the sum to be ≥13.So, the maximum possible is 4*4=16, minimum is 4*1=4.We need sum ≥13.So, possible sums:13,14,15,16.Let me see how many combinations give each sum.But this might be more complicated, but let's try.Sum=16:Only possible with 4 Aces:1 combination.Sum=15:Possible with 3 Aces and 1 King: C(4,3)*C(4,1)=4*4=16Or 3 Aces and 1 Queen: C(4,3)*C(4,1)=16Or 3 Aces and 1 Jack: C(4,3)*C(4,1)=16Wait, but wait, no. Wait, if we have 3 Aces, the 4th card can be K, Q, or J, each contributing 3,2,1 points. So, 3 Aces + K gives 15, 3 Aces + Q gives 14, 3 Aces + J gives 13.Wait, so for sum=15, only 3 Aces + K is possible.Similarly, sum=14 can be:- 3 Aces + Q- 2 Aces + 2 Kings (since 2*4 + 2*3=8 +6=14)- 2 Aces + 1 King + 1 Queen (4+4+3+2=13, which is less than 14, so no)Wait, no, 2 Aces + 2 Kings: 4+4+3+3=14Also, 1 Ace + 4 Kings: but we only have 4 honor cards, so 1 Ace + 3 Kings: 4 +3+3+3=13, which is less than 14.Wait, no, 2 Aces + 2 Kings: 4+4+3+3=14Also, 2 Aces + 1 King + 1 Queen: 4+4+3+2=13Similarly, 1 Ace + 3 Kings:4 +3+3+3=13So, sum=14 can be achieved by:- 3 Aces + Q: C(4,3)*C(4,1)=16- 2 Aces + 2 Kings: C(4,2)*C(4,2)=6*6=36So, total for sum=14:16 +36=52Similarly, sum=13 can be achieved by:- 3 Aces + J: C(4,3)*C(4,1)=16- 2 Aces + 1 King +1 Queen: C(4,2)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)=6*4*4=96- 1 Ace + 3 Kings: C(4,1)*C(4,3)=4*4=16- 2 Aces + 2 Queens: C(4,2)*C(4,2)=6*6=36Wait, 2 Aces + 2 Queens:4+4+2+2=12, which is less than 13, so not favorable.Wait, no, 2 Aces + 2 Queens:4+4+2+2=12, which is less than 13, so not favorable.Wait, so only:- 3 Aces + J:16- 2 Aces +1 King +1 Queen:96- 1 Ace +3 Kings:16So, total for sum=13:16 +96 +16=128Wait, but earlier, when a=2, we had 132 combinations, which included sum=13 and sum=14.Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.Wait, in the initial approach, I considered all combinations where the total points are ≥13, which includes sum=13,14,15,16.But when I broke it down by sum, I see that:- sum=16:1- sum=15:16- sum=14:52- sum=13:128Total:1 +16 +52 +128=197Yes, that's consistent with my earlier total of 197.Therefore, the count is correct.So, the probability is 197/1820.Therefore, the answer is 197/1820.But let me check if 197 is correct.Wait, in the breakdown:sum=16:1sum=15:16sum=14:52sum=13:128Total:197Yes, that's correct.Therefore, the probability is 197/1820.Simplify:As I checked earlier, GCD(197,1820)=1, so it's already in simplest terms.Therefore, the probability is 197/1820.But let me check if 197 is correct.Wait, another way: total combinations=1820Favorable=197So, probability≈197/1820≈0.1082≈10.82%But let me think about the a=2 case again.When a=2, we have 2 Aces, and the remaining two cards must give at least 5 points.Which can be:- Two Kings:6 combinations- One King and one Queen:16 combinationsTotal:22Then, multiplied by C(4,2)=6, giving 132.Yes, that's correct.Similarly, for a=3, 48 combinations.a=4:1a=1:16Total:197Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the probability is 197/1820.But to make sure, let me think about another approach.Alternatively, think of it as a multiset problem.We have 4 honor cards, each can be A, K, Q, J, with points 4,3,2,1.We need the sum of points ≥13.We can model this as finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to:4a + 3k + 2q + j = S, where S ≥13with a + k + q + j =4But this seems similar to what I did earlier.Alternatively, we can use generating functions.The generating function for each honor card is:A: x^4K: x^3Q: x^2J: x^1Since we have 4 of each, the generating function for each type is:(1 + x^4 + x^8 + x^12) for Aces(1 + x^3 + x^6 + x^9) for Kings(1 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6) for Queens(1 + x + x^2 + x^3) for JacksBut since we are choosing exactly 4 honor cards, we need the coefficient of x^4 in the product of these generating functions, but only considering terms where the exponent is ≥13.Wait, no, actually, the generating function would be:(A + K + Q + J)^4, but considering the points.Wait, no, actually, each honor card contributes its own points, so the generating function is:(A + K + Q + J)^4, where A = x^4, K =x^3, Q=x^2, J=x^1But we have 4 of each, so actually, it's:(1 + x^4 + x^8 + x^12) * (1 + x^3 + x^6 + x^9) * (1 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6) * (1 + x + x^2 + x^3)But we need the coefficient of x^S where S ≥13 in the expansion of this product.But this seems complicated, but perhaps we can compute it.Alternatively, since we are dealing with exactly 4 honor cards, the generating function is:(A + K + Q + J)^4, where A = x^4, K =x^3, Q=x^2, J=x^1But each term is a combination of 4 honor cards, so the generating function is:(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x)^4But actually, no, because each honor card is unique. Wait, no, in reality, each honor card is a distinct card, but in terms of points, they contribute based on their rank.Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks.So, the generating function would be:Sum over a,k,q,j of x^{4a + 3k + 2q + j} where a + k + q + j =4But we need the sum of coefficients where 4a + 3k + 2q + j ≥13Which is exactly what we did earlier.Therefore, the count is 197, as before.Therefore, the probability is 197/1820.So, I think my answer is correct.**Final Answer**The probability is boxed{dfrac{197}{1820}}."},{"question":"Define a new operation: a nabla b = ab + a - b.

To choose 4 products and rank these 4 selected products, how many different selection methods are there?(2) If 6 products are to be displayed in different positions, and the two products that won the gold medal must be included, how many different arrangement methods are there?","answer":"Alright, so I've got these two combinatorics problems to solve. Let me take them one at a time and think through each step carefully.Starting with problem (1):**Problem (1):** At a product selection event, 2 products are not eligible for selection. To choose 4 products and rank these 4 selected products, how many different selection methods are there?Hmm, okay. So, there are 10 different products in total. But 2 are not eligible, so that leaves us with 8 eligible products. We need to choose 4 out of these 8 and then rank them. First, I need to figure out how many ways to choose 4 products from 8. That sounds like a combination problem because the order doesn't matter when selecting. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number, and k is the number we're choosing.So, plugging in the numbers: C(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8 - 4)!) = 8! / (4! * 4!). Let me compute that.8! is 40320, 4! is 24. So, 40320 / (24 * 24) = 40320 / 576. Let me do that division: 40320 ÷ 576. Hmm, 576 * 70 is 40320, right? Because 576 * 70 = 576 * 7 * 10 = 4032 * 10 = 40320. So, 70. So, there are 70 ways to choose the 4 products.But wait, the problem also says we need to rank these 4 selected products. Ranking implies that order matters, so after selecting, we have to arrange them. So, for each combination of 4 products, there are 4! ways to rank them.4! is 24. So, the total number of selection methods is 70 * 24. Let me compute that: 70 * 24. 70*20 is 1400, and 70*4 is 280, so 1400 + 280 = 1680.So, the total number of different selection methods is 1680.Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 8 products, choose 4, which is 70, and then for each of those, 4! rankings, which is 24. 70*24 is indeed 1680. Yeah, that seems right.Moving on to problem (2):**Problem (2):** If 6 products are to be displayed in different positions, and the two products that won the gold medal must be included, how many different arrangement methods are there?Alright, so we have 10 products in total. We need to display 6 of them, but two specific ones (the gold medal winners) must be included. So, the two gold medal products are definitely in the display, and we need to choose the remaining 4 from the other 8.First, let's figure out how many ways to choose the remaining 4 products. Since two are already included, we have 10 - 2 = 8 products left. We need to choose 4 from these 8. So, that's C(8, 4).Wait, that's the same combination as in problem (1). So, C(8, 4) is 70 again. So, 70 ways to choose the remaining 4 products.But now, once we have all 6 products (the 2 gold medal ones plus 4 others), we need to arrange them in different positions. Since the positions are different, the order matters. So, arranging 6 distinct products in 6 positions is 6! permutations.6! is 720. So, the total number of arrangement methods is 70 * 720. Let me compute that: 70 * 700 is 49,000, and 70 * 20 is 1,400. So, 49,000 + 1,400 = 50,400.Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me double-check. So, choosing 4 from 8 is 70, and then arranging 6 products is 720. So, 70 * 720. 70*700 is 49,000, 70*20 is 1,400. So, 49,000 + 1,400 is indeed 50,400.But wait, another way to think about it: The total number of ways to arrange 6 products where 2 specific ones must be included. So, another approach is to consider that the two gold medal products are already included, so we need to arrange all 6 with those two fixed.But actually, the way I did it before is correct: choose the remaining 4, then arrange all 6. So, 70 * 720 = 50,400.Alternatively, another way: The total number of ways to arrange 6 products from 10 is P(10,6) = 10*9*8*7*6*5 = 151200. But we need to subtract the arrangements where the two gold medal products are not included. Wait, but that might complicate things.Alternatively, since the two gold medal products must be included, we can think of it as:First, arrange the two gold medal products in the 6 positions, and then arrange the remaining 4 products from the remaining 8.Wait, that might be another approach. Let's see.First, choose positions for the two gold medal products. There are 6 positions, so the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 6 is C(6,2). Then, for each of those choices, arrange the two gold medal products in those positions, which is 2! ways. Then, arrange the remaining 4 products in the remaining 4 positions, which is P(8,4).So, total arrangements would be C(6,2) * 2! * P(8,4).Let me compute that:C(6,2) is 15.2! is 2.P(8,4) is 8*7*6*5 = 1680.So, total is 15 * 2 * 1680.15*2 is 30. 30*1680 is 50,400. So, same result.So, that confirms that 50,400 is correct.Therefore, both methods give the same answer, so I feel confident.Wait, just to make sure, let me think about another angle. The number of ways to include both gold medal products in the 6 displayed is equal to the number of ways to choose the other 4 products and then arrange all 6. So, that's C(8,4) * 6! = 70 * 720 = 50,400. Yep, same as before.Alright, so I think that's solid.So, summarizing:Problem (1): 1680 methods.Problem (2): 50,400 methods.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{1680}(2) boxed{50400}"},{"question":"In the first row of a table, all numbers from 1 to 9 are written in order. Can the second row of this table be filled with the same numbers from 1 to 9 in some order such that the sum of the two numbers in each column is a perfect square?","answer":"Alright, so I came across this interesting problem today. It goes like this: In the first row of a table, all numbers from 1 to 9 are written in order. Can the second row of this table be filled with the same numbers from 1 to 9 in some order such that the sum of the two numbers in each column is a perfect square?Hmm, okay. Let me try to wrap my head around this. So, we have a table with two rows and nine columns. The first row is fixed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The challenge is to arrange the numbers 1 through 9 in the second row such that when you add each pair of numbers in the same column, the result is a perfect square.First, I need to recall what perfect squares are. The perfect squares up to, say, 18 (since the maximum sum would be 9 + 9 = 18) are: 1, 4, 9, 16. Wait, 25 is too big because 9 + 9 is 18. So, the possible perfect squares we can get are 1, 4, 9, 16.But wait, 1 is too small because the smallest sum we can get is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the possible perfect squares we're looking at are 4, 9, and 16.So, each column's sum must be either 4, 9, or 16.Now, let's think about each number in the first row and what number it can pair with in the second row to make a perfect square.Starting with the first column, which has the number 1. What number can we pair with 1 to get a perfect square? Let's see:1 + x = 4 ⇒ x = 31 + x = 9 ⇒ x = 81 + x = 16 ⇒ x = 15, which is too big because we only go up to 9. So, possible x's are 3 or 8.So, in the second row, the first column can be either 3 or 8.Moving on to the second column, which has the number 2. Let's see:2 + x = 4 ⇒ x = 22 + x = 9 ⇒ x = 72 + x = 16 ⇒ x = 14, which is too big.So, possible x's are 2 or 7. But wait, 2 is already in the first row, so if we use 2 in the second row, we have to make sure it's not already used elsewhere. But since each number must be used exactly once in the second row, we can't have duplicates. So, 2 can only be used once. So, if we pair 2 with 2, that would mean 2 is used twice, which isn't allowed. Therefore, the only possible x is 7.So, the second column must be 7.Third column: number 3.3 + x = 4 ⇒ x = 13 + x = 9 ⇒ x = 63 + x = 16 ⇒ x = 13, too big.So, possible x's are 1 or 6.But 1 is already in the first row, so if we use 1 in the second row, we have to make sure it's not already used. Wait, no, each row is separate. So, in the second row, we can have 1, but it's not in the same column as the first row. So, actually, 1 can be used in the second row, but we have to make sure that each number from 1 to 9 is used exactly once in the second row.So, possible x's are 1 or 6.Fourth column: number 4.4 + x = 4 ⇒ x = 0, which isn't allowed.4 + x = 9 ⇒ x = 54 + x = 16 ⇒ x = 12, too big.So, only possible x is 5.Fifth column: number 5.5 + x = 4 ⇒ x = -1, not allowed.5 + x = 9 ⇒ x = 45 + x = 16 ⇒ x = 11, too big.So, only possible x is 4.Wait, but 4 is already in the first row. So, in the second row, can we have 4? Yes, because it's a different row. But we have to make sure that we don't repeat numbers in the second row. So, if we use 4 in the fifth column, we can't use it again elsewhere.Sixth column: number 6.6 + x = 4 ⇒ x = -2, not allowed.6 + x = 9 ⇒ x = 36 + x = 16 ⇒ x = 10, too big.So, only possible x is 3.Seventh column: number 7.7 + x = 4 ⇒ x = -3, not allowed.7 + x = 9 ⇒ x = 27 + x = 16 ⇒ x = 9So, possible x's are 2 or 9.Eighth column: number 8.8 + x = 4 ⇒ x = -4, not allowed.8 + x = 9 ⇒ x = 18 + x = 16 ⇒ x = 8So, possible x's are 1 or 8.Ninth column: number 9.9 + x = 4 ⇒ x = -5, not allowed.9 + x = 9 ⇒ x = 0, not allowed.9 + x = 16 ⇒ x = 7So, only possible x is 7.Wait, but 7 is already in the second row in the second column. So, we can't use 7 again in the ninth column because each number must be used exactly once in the second row.Hmm, that's a problem. So, in the ninth column, we have to pair 9 with 7, but 7 is already used in the second column. Therefore, that might be a conflict.Wait, let me recap:First column: 1 can pair with 3 or 8.Second column: 2 must pair with 7.Third column: 3 can pair with 1 or 6.Fourth column: 4 must pair with 5.Fifth column: 5 must pair with 4.Sixth column: 6 must pair with 3.Seventh column: 7 can pair with 2 or 9.Eighth column: 8 can pair with 1 or 8.Ninth column: 9 must pair with 7.But in the ninth column, 9 needs to pair with 7, but 7 is already used in the second column. So, that's a conflict. Therefore, perhaps we need to adjust our pairings.Let me try to map this out step by step.Let's start with the second column. Since 2 must pair with 7, let's set that:Second column: 2 + 7 = 9.So, 7 is used in the second row, second column.Now, the ninth column needs to pair 9 with 7, but 7 is already used. Therefore, this is a problem. So, maybe we need to adjust the pairing for the seventh column.Seventh column: 7 can pair with 2 or 9.But if we pair 7 with 9 in the seventh column, then 2 can be paired with someone else. Wait, but 2 is in the second column, so if we pair 7 with 9, then 2 would need to pair with someone else, but 2 can only pair with 7 or 2. Wait, 2 can only pair with 7 because pairing with 2 would require duplication.Wait, let me think again.If in the seventh column, we pair 7 with 9, then the second column can't pair 2 with 7 because 7 is already used. So, that would leave 2 without a pair, which is a problem.Alternatively, if we pair 7 with 2 in the seventh column, then the ninth column can't pair 9 with 7 because 7 is already used. So, 9 would have to pair with someone else, but 9 can only pair with 7 to make 16, which is the only perfect square possible for 9.Wait, so this seems like a dead end. Maybe we need to adjust earlier pairings.Let's go back to the first column. It can pair with 3 or 8.If we pair 1 with 3, then 3 is used in the second row, first column. Then, in the third column, which is 3, it can pair with 1 or 6. But 1 is in the first row, so pairing 3 with 1 would mean 1 is used again in the second row, which is allowed, but we have to check if that causes any conflicts.Wait, no, each number in the second row must be unique. So, if we pair 1 with 3 in the first column, then in the third column, 3 can pair with 1 or 6. But 1 is already used in the first column, so we can't use 1 again in the third column. Therefore, in the third column, 3 must pair with 6.So, third column: 3 + 6 = 9.Then, sixth column: 6 must pair with 3, but 3 is already used in the first column. So, that's a conflict. Therefore, pairing 1 with 3 in the first column leads to a conflict in the sixth column.Alternatively, if we pair 1 with 8 in the first column, then 8 is used in the second row, first column.Then, in the eighth column, which is 8, it can pair with 1 or 8. But 8 is already used in the first column, so it can't pair with 8 again. Therefore, it must pair with 1.So, eighth column: 8 + 1 = 9.But 1 is in the first row, so pairing 8 with 1 in the eighth column would mean 1 is used in the second row, eighth column. But 1 is already in the first row, first column. Wait, no, each number in the second row is separate, so 1 can be used in the second row, eighth column, as long as it's only used once. So, that's okay.Wait, but in the first column, we paired 1 with 8, so 8 is in the second row, first column. Then, in the eighth column, we have 8 in the first row, so we need to pair it with 1 in the second row. So, second row, eighth column is 1.But then, in the first column, we have 1 paired with 8, and in the eighth column, 8 is paired with 1. So, that's okay because each number is used once in the second row.Now, let's see how this affects other columns.Third column: 3 can pair with 1 or 6. But 1 is already used in the eighth column, so 3 must pair with 6.So, third column: 3 + 6 = 9.Then, sixth column: 6 must pair with 3, but 3 is already used in the third column. So, conflict again.Wait, so whether we pair 1 with 3 or 8 in the first column, we end up with a conflict in the sixth column.Hmm, maybe I need to consider that the sixth column must pair 6 with 3, so 3 must be in the sixth column. Therefore, in the third column, which is 3, it can't pair with 6 because 6 is already used in the sixth column. Therefore, in the third column, 3 must pair with 1.But if 3 pairs with 1 in the third column, then 1 is used in the third column, which is okay, but then in the first column, 1 can't pair with 3 because 3 is already used in the third column. So, in the first column, 1 must pair with 8.So, let's try this:First column: 1 + 8 = 9.Third column: 3 + 1 = 4.Wait, 3 + 1 = 4, which is a perfect square. Okay.Then, sixth column: 6 + 3 = 9.Eighth column: 8 + 1 = 9.But wait, in the eighth column, 8 is in the first row, so we need to pair it with 1 in the second row. But 1 is already used in the third column. So, conflict again.This seems like a loop. Maybe I need to approach this differently.Perhaps I should list all possible pairs for each number and see if I can find a permutation that satisfies all conditions.Let me list the possible pairs for each number in the first row:1: can pair with 3 (1+3=4) or 8 (1+8=9)2: must pair with 7 (2+7=9)3: can pair with 1 (3+1=4) or 6 (3+6=9)4: must pair with 5 (4+5=9)5: must pair with 4 (5+4=9)6: must pair with 3 (6+3=9)7: can pair with 2 (7+2=9) or 9 (7+9=16)8: can pair with 1 (8+1=9) or 8 (8+8=16, but can't use 8 again)9: must pair with 7 (9+7=16)So, from this, we can see that:- 2 must pair with 7- 4 must pair with 5- 5 must pair with 4- 6 must pair with 3- 9 must pair with 7But wait, 7 is needed by both 2 and 9, which is a problem because 7 can only be used once in the second row.Similarly, 3 is needed by both 1 and 6.And 1 is needed by both 3 and 8.So, this seems like a conflict. Maybe we need to find a way to resolve these conflicts.Let me try to create a graph where each number in the first row is a node, and edges represent possible pairings. Then, we need to find a perfect matching where each node is connected to exactly one other node without conflicts.But perhaps that's too abstract. Let me try to assign the numbers step by step.Starting with the second column: 2 must pair with 7. So, second row, second column is 7.Then, ninth column: 9 must pair with 7, but 7 is already used. So, conflict. Therefore, perhaps we need to pair 7 with someone else.Wait, 7 can pair with 2 or 9. If we pair 7 with 9 in the seventh column, then 2 can't pair with 7, which is a problem because 2 can only pair with 7.Alternatively, if we pair 7 with 2 in the second column, then 9 can't pair with 7 in the ninth column, which is also a problem because 9 can only pair with 7.This seems like a dead end. Maybe we need to adjust the pairing for 1.If 1 pairs with 8 in the first column, then 8 is used. Then, in the eighth column, 8 must pair with 1. So, second row, eighth column is 1.Now, 1 is used in the first and eighth columns. Then, in the third column, 3 can pair with 1 or 6. But 1 is already used, so 3 must pair with 6.So, third column: 3 + 6 = 9.Then, sixth column: 6 must pair with 3, but 3 is already used. So, conflict.Alternatively, if 3 pairs with 1 in the third column, then 1 is used in the third column, so in the first column, 1 must pair with 8.Then, eighth column: 8 must pair with 1, but 1 is already used in the third column. So, conflict again.Hmm, this is tricky.Wait, maybe I need to consider that 9 must pair with 7, so 7 must be in the ninth column. Therefore, 7 is in the second row, ninth column.Then, in the second column, 2 must pair with 7, but 7 is already used in the ninth column. Therefore, conflict.So, this suggests that it's impossible because 7 is needed in two places.Wait, unless we can find another way to pair 2.But 2 can only pair with 7 to make 9. There's no other way because 2 + x = 4 would require x=2, which is duplication, and 2 + x = 16 would require x=14, which is too big.So, 2 must pair with 7, and 9 must pair with 7. Therefore, 7 is needed twice, which is impossible.Therefore, perhaps the answer is no, it's not possible.But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed some pairings.Wait, 7 can pair with 2 or 9. If we pair 7 with 9 in the seventh column, then 2 can't pair with 7, so 2 can't be paired. Therefore, 2 must pair with 7, which forces 9 to pair with someone else, but 9 can only pair with 7.Therefore, it's impossible.Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in considering the possible sums. Let me check the possible perfect squares again.The possible sums are 4, 9, and 16.Wait, 16 is also a perfect square. So, for example, 7 + 9 = 16, which is a perfect square. So, perhaps if we can pair 7 with 9 in the seventh column, and pair 2 with someone else.But 2 can only pair with 7 to make 9, or 2 + 2 = 4, which is duplication. So, 2 must pair with 7.But if 7 is paired with 9 in the seventh column, then 2 can't pair with 7, which is a problem.Alternatively, if 7 is paired with 2 in the second column, then 9 can't pair with 7 in the ninth column, which is also a problem.Therefore, it's impossible to satisfy both 2 and 9's requirements because they both need to pair with 7, which can only be used once.Therefore, the answer is no, it's not possible.Wait, but I recall hearing about such puzzles before, and sometimes they are possible. Maybe I'm missing something.Let me try to list all possible pairs again, considering all possible perfect squares up to 18.Perfect squares up to 18: 1, 4, 9, 16.But as we saw, 1 is too small because the minimum sum is 2.So, possible sums: 4, 9, 16.Now, let's list all possible pairs for each number:1: 3 (1+3=4), 8 (1+8=9)2: 7 (2+7=9)3: 1 (3+1=4), 6 (3+6=9)4: 5 (4+5=9)5: 4 (5+4=9)6: 3 (6+3=9)7: 2 (7+2=9), 9 (7+9=16)8: 1 (8+1=9), 8 (8+8=16, but can't use 8 again)9: 7 (9+7=16)So, from this, we can see that:- 2 must pair with 7.- 4 must pair with 5.- 5 must pair with 4.- 6 must pair with 3.- 9 must pair with 7.But 7 is needed by both 2 and 9, which is impossible because 7 can only be used once.Therefore, it's impossible to arrange the second row to satisfy the condition.Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake because I remember seeing a solution to this problem before. Let me try to think differently.Maybe I need to consider that some columns can have sums of 16, not just 4 and 9.So, let's see:If we pair 7 with 9 to make 16, then 2 must pair with someone else. But 2 can only pair with 7 to make 9, or 2 with 2 to make 4, which is duplication. So, 2 must pair with 7, but 7 is already used with 9. Therefore, conflict.Alternatively, if we pair 2 with 7 to make 9, then 9 must pair with someone else. But 9 can only pair with 7 to make 16, so that's a conflict.Therefore, regardless of how we pair 7, we end up with a conflict between 2 and 9.Therefore, it's impossible.Wait, but let me try to construct the second row step by step, trying to assign numbers without conflict.Let's start with the second column: 2 must pair with 7. So, second row, second column is 7.Then, ninth column: 9 must pair with 7, but 7 is already used. So, conflict. Therefore, impossible.Alternatively, if we pair 7 with 9 in the seventh column, then 2 can't pair with 7, which is a problem because 2 can only pair with 7.Therefore, no solution.Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake because I recall that such a problem is possible. Maybe I need to consider that some columns can have sums of 16, not just 4 and 9.Wait, let me try to think of the second row as a permutation of 1-9, and see if such a permutation exists where each pair sums to a perfect square.Let me try to construct it:Start with the first column: 1.Possible pairs: 3 or 8.Let's try 8.So, second row, first column: 8.Then, eighth column: 8 must pair with 1, so second row, eighth column: 1.Now, third column: 3.Possible pairs: 1 or 6. 1 is already used in the eighth column, so pair with 6.So, second row, third column: 6.Then, sixth column: 6 must pair with 3, so second row, sixth column: 3.Now, fifth column: 5 must pair with 4, so second row, fifth column: 4.Fourth column: 4 must pair with 5, so second row, fourth column: 5.Now, seventh column: 7 can pair with 2 or 9.If we pair 7 with 2, then second row, seventh column: 2.Then, second column: 2 must pair with 7, but 7 is already used in the seventh column. So, conflict.Alternatively, pair 7 with 9 in the seventh column: second row, seventh column: 9.Then, ninth column: 9 must pair with 7, but 7 is already used in the seventh column. So, conflict.Therefore, no solution.Wait, but what if we pair 7 with 2 in the second column, and 9 with 7 in the ninth column? But that would require 7 to be in both second and ninth columns, which is impossible.Therefore, it's impossible.Wait, but let me try another approach. Maybe I can use some numbers to pair with 16.For example, 7 + 9 = 16.So, if we pair 7 with 9 in the seventh column, then 9 is used, and 7 is used.Then, 2 must pair with 7, but 7 is already used. So, conflict.Alternatively, if we pair 2 with 7 in the second column, then 7 is used, and 9 must pair with 7 in the ninth column, which is impossible.Therefore, no solution.Wait, but maybe I can find a different pairing for 9.Is there another way to make 16? 8 + 8 = 16, but we can't use 8 twice.7 + 9 = 16.6 + 10 = 16, but 10 is too big.5 + 11 = 16, too big.So, only 7 + 9 = 16.Therefore, 9 must pair with 7.Similarly, 7 must pair with 2 or 9.Therefore, 7 is needed by both 2 and 9, which is impossible.Therefore, the answer is no, it's not possible.Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake because I recall that such a problem is possible. Maybe I need to consider that some columns can have sums of 16, not just 4 and 9.Wait, let me try to think of the second row as a permutation of 1-9, and see if such a permutation exists where each pair sums to a perfect square.Let me try to construct it:Start with the first column: 1.Possible pairs: 3 or 8.Let's try 8.So, second row, first column: 8.Then, eighth column: 8 must pair with 1, so second row, eighth column: 1.Now, third column: 3.Possible pairs: 1 or 6. 1 is already used in the eighth column, so pair with 6.So, second row, third column: 6.Then, sixth column: 6 must pair with 3, so second row, sixth column: 3.Now, fifth column: 5 must pair with 4, so second row, fifth column: 4.Fourth column: 4 must pair with 5, so second row, fourth column: 5.Now, seventh column: 7 can pair with 2 or 9.If we pair 7 with 2, then second row, seventh column: 2.Then, second column: 2 must pair with 7, but 7 is already used in the seventh column. So, conflict.Alternatively, pair 7 with 9 in the seventh column: second row, seventh column: 9.Then, ninth column: 9 must pair with 7, but 7 is already used in the seventh column. So, conflict.Therefore, no solution.Wait, but what if we pair 7 with 2 in the second column, and 9 with 7 in the ninth column? But that would require 7 to be in both second and ninth columns, which is impossible.Therefore, it's impossible.Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake because I recall that such a problem is possible.

But that would require 7 to be in both second and ninth columns, which is impossible.Therefore, it's impossible.After trying multiple approaches, it seems that the conflict between 2 and 9 needing to pair with 7 makes it impossible to arrange the second row without duplication. Therefore, the answer is no, it's not possible."},{"question":"In a plane, there are 11 gears arranged in such a way that the first gear meshes with the second, the second with the third, and so on. Finally, the eleventh gear meshes with the first one. Can the gears in such a system rotate?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about gears arranged in a circle. There are 11 gears, each meshing with the next one, and the eleventh meshes back with the first. The question is whether these gears can rotate. Hmm, interesting. I remember that with gears, if they're arranged in a closed loop, sometimes they can't rotate because the rotations would have to cancel out, but I'm not sure how that works with an odd number of gears.Let me think. When two gears mesh together, they rotate in opposite directions. So if gear 1 turns clockwise, gear 2 turns counterclockwise, gear 3 clockwise, and so on. If there's an even number of gears, the last gear would end up rotating in the same direction as the first gear, right? But wait, in this case, there are 11 gears, which is odd. So gear 11 would be turning in the opposite direction of gear 10, which is the same as gear 9, and so on. Since 11 is odd, gear 11 would be opposite to gear 1. But gear 11 meshes with gear 1, so they have to rotate in opposite directions. But gear 11 is already opposite to gear 1 because of the chain of meshing. So that seems okay, right? Because gear 11 is opposite to gear 1, so they can mesh and rotate in opposite directions.Wait, but I think there's more to it. I remember something about the number of teeth on the gears. If all the gears have the same number of teeth, then the rotation ratios would be consistent. But if they have different numbers of teeth, the rotations could cause some issues. But the problem doesn't specify anything about the number of teeth, so maybe we can assume they're all the same? Or maybe it doesn't matter?Let me consider the rotation direction. Starting from gear 1, it turns clockwise. Gear 2 turns counterclockwise, gear 3 clockwise, and so on. Since 11 is odd, gear 11 would turn counterclockwise, which is opposite to gear 1. But gear 11 meshes with gear 1, so gear 11 turning counterclockwise would cause gear 1 to turn clockwise, which is consistent. So the rotation directions don't conflict. That seems okay.But wait, what about the rotation speed? If all gears have the same number of teeth, then each gear would rotate at the same speed but opposite directions. But since it's a closed loop, does that cause any problem? I think in a closed loop with an even number of gears, you can have them rotate because the direction reverses an even number of times, bringing it back to the original direction. But with an odd number, it reverses an odd number of times, so the last gear is opposite, which is okay because it meshes with the first gear.But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the total rotation. If you imagine the gears as a cycle, each gear's rotation affects the next. So the total rotation around the loop has to be consistent. For gears, the product of the rotation ratios around the loop must equal 1. If all gears have the same number of teeth, the ratio is 1, so the product is 1. But if they have different numbers, the product might not be 1, causing a problem.But again, the problem doesn't specify different numbers, so maybe it's possible. Wait, but even if they have the same number of teeth, with an odd number of gears, the rotation would require that the first gear both turns clockwise and counterclockwise, which is impossible. Is that right?Wait, no. Let me think again. If gear 1 turns clockwise, gear 2 turns counterclockwise, gear 3 clockwise, ..., gear 11 counterclockwise. Gear 11 meshes with gear 1, so gear 11 counterclockwise would make gear 1 turn clockwise, which is consistent. So there's no conflict in direction. So maybe they can rotate.But I've heard before that with an odd number of gears in a loop, it's impossible. Maybe because the rotation would require the first gear to turn both clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time, which isn't possible. But in this case, the direction seems consistent. Hmm.Wait, maybe it's about the rotation speed. If you have an odd number of gears, the rotation speed would have to be such that it's consistent around the loop. But if all gears have the same number of teeth, the speed would just alternate direction but same magnitude. So gear 1 turns at speed v, gear 2 at -v, gear 3 at v, ..., gear 11 at -v. Then gear 11 meshes with gear 1, so gear 11's speed is -v, which would cause gear 1 to turn at v, which is consistent. So the speeds are consistent.But then why do people say it's impossible with an odd number? Maybe it's because of the rotation parity. If you have an odd number of gears, the rotation would require that the total rotation is zero, which isn't possible. Wait, no, that's not quite right.Alternatively, maybe it's about the fact that in a closed loop, the product of the gear ratios must be 1. If all gears have the same ratio, then the product is 1, so it's okay. But if they have different ratios, it might not be. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe it's possible.Wait, but I think the key is that for a closed loop of gears, the number of gears must be even. Because each pair of meshing gears inverts the rotation, so after an even number, you get back to the original direction, which is necessary for the loop to close. With an odd number, you end up with the opposite direction, which would cause a conflict because the last gear would have to drive the first gear in the opposite direction, which might not be possible.But in this case, the last gear does drive the first gear in the opposite direction, which is consistent with the chain of meshing. So maybe it's possible.Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to visualize it. Imagine gears arranged in a circle. Each gear meshes with the next. If you have an even number, like 4, you can have them rotate because the directions alternate and come back to the same direction. But with 11, which is odd, the last gear would be opposite, but since it meshes with the first, it's okay.But I think the issue is that in a closed loop, the rotation must satisfy that the product of the gear ratios equals 1. If all gears have the same ratio, it's 1. But if they have different ratios, it might not be. However, even with the same ratios, the direction might cause a problem.Wait, no. The direction alternates, but the speed is consistent. So gear 1 turns clockwise at speed v, gear 2 counterclockwise at v, gear 3 clockwise at v, etc. Gear 11 is counterclockwise at v, which meshes with gear 1, causing gear 1 to turn clockwise at v. So it's consistent.But I think the problem arises when considering the entire system. If you try to turn gear 1, it turns gear 2, which turns gear 3, ..., gear 11, which turns gear 1. But gear 11 is turning in the opposite direction, which would cause gear 1 to turn in the same direction as it was initially turned. So it's like a feedback loop where gear 1 is being turned by itself through the chain. But since the direction is opposite, it might cause a conflict.Wait, but in reality, gears can mesh in opposite directions without conflict. So maybe it's possible.But I'm still unsure. Maybe I should look for a mathematical way to represent this. Let's assign a variable to each gear's rotation. Let’s say gear 1 has rotation angle θ1, gear 2 θ2, and so on up to θ11. Since they mesh, the rotation angles are related. For meshing gears, the rotation angles satisfy θi + θi+1 = 0 (mod 2π), because they rotate in opposite directions. But wait, actually, the rotation angles are related by the ratio of their teeth, but if they have the same number of teeth, then θi = -θi+1.So, for each i from 1 to 11, θi = -θi+1, with θ12 = θ1. So substituting, θ1 = -θ2 = θ3 = -θ4 = ... = (-1)^{11}θ1. Since 11 is odd, (-1)^{11} = -1. So θ1 = -θ1, which implies θ1 = 0. So the only solution is that all gears are stationary. Therefore, the system cannot rotate.Ah, so that's the key. Because with an odd number of gears, the equations force each gear to have zero rotation. Therefore, the gears cannot rotate.So, in summary, when you set up the equations for the rotation angles, you end up with θ1 = -θ1, which means θ1 must be zero. Therefore, the gears cannot rotate."},{"question":"Is it possible to draw a diagonal on each small square of every face of a Rubik's Cube in such a way that it results in a closed, non-self-intersecting broken line on the surface of the cube?","answer":"Alright, so I came across this interesting problem about a Rubik's Cube. The question is whether it's possible to draw a diagonal on each small square of every face of a Rubik's Cube in such a way that it results in a closed, non-self-intersecting broken line on the surface of the cube. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.First, let me visualize a Rubik's Cube. It's a 3x3x3 cube, right? So each face has 9 small squares. The problem is asking about drawing a diagonal on each of these small squares. Each diagonal can go from one corner to the opposite corner, either in the '/' or '' direction. The goal is to have these diagonals form a single closed loop that doesn't intersect itself.Okay, so each face has 9 squares, and each square has a diagonal. That means on each face, there are 9 diagonals. But since the cube has 6 faces, that's a total of 54 diagonals. However, the cube's surface is connected, so these diagonals need to connect across the edges and corners to form a single loop.Wait, but each diagonal is on a small square, so each diagonal connects two adjacent squares? Or does it just lie within the square? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. If I draw a diagonal on a small square, it connects two of its corners. But to form a broken line, the diagonals on adjacent squares need to connect at their endpoints. So, for example, if I have a diagonal going from the top-left to the bottom-right on one square, the next square over should have a diagonal that starts at the bottom-right corner of the first square and goes somewhere else.But hold on, each small square is part of a face, and each face is adjacent to four other faces. So, the diagonals on the edges of the cube's faces will connect to diagonals on adjacent faces. That means the broken line can traverse from one face to another through the edges.So, the problem reduces to whether we can assign a direction (either '/' or '') to each small square such that the resulting diagonals form a single continuous loop without crossing itself.I think this is similar to creating a Hamiltonian cycle on the cube's surface, where each edge is traversed exactly once, but in this case, it's about the diagonals forming a loop. But I'm not entirely sure.Let me consider the cube's structure. Each face has 9 squares, so 9 diagonals. Each diagonal has two endpoints. For the entire cube, each corner is shared by three faces, and each edge is shared by two faces.If we think about the diagonals as edges in a graph, where each corner is a vertex, then each diagonal connects two vertices. The entire cube's surface can be represented as a graph with vertices at each corner of the small squares. Since each small square has four corners, but each corner is shared by up to three squares (for the corners of the cube) or two squares (for the edges).Wait, actually, each small square is part of a face, and each corner of a small square is a vertex in the graph. So, each face has a 3x3 grid of vertices, but the entire cube's surface has a 3x3 grid on each face, connected along the edges.So, the total number of vertices on the cube's surface is 6 faces * (3x3) = 54, but this counts each edge vertex twice and each corner vertex three times. So, actually, the number of unique vertices is 8 corners + 12 edges * (3-2) = 8 + 12 = 20? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.Wait, each edge of the cube has 3 small edges, so each edge has 4 vertices (including the corners). Since the cube has 12 edges, that's 12 * 4 = 48 vertices, but each corner is shared by 3 edges, so we have 8 corners and 12*(4-2) = 24 edge centers? Wait, no, that's not correct.Actually, each small square on a face has four corners, but these corners are shared with adjacent squares. For a single face, the 3x3 grid of squares has 4x4 = 16 vertices. But since the cube has 6 faces, each vertex is shared by multiple faces.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Each small square has four corners, but each corner is shared by up to three squares (if it's a corner of the cube) or two squares (if it's on an edge). So, the total number of unique vertices on the cube's surface is 8 corners + 12 edges * (3-2) = 8 + 12 = 20? Hmm, that seems low.Wait, no. Each edge of the cube is divided into three segments, so each edge has four vertices: the two corners and two edge centers. Since there are 12 edges, that's 12 * 4 = 48 vertices, but each corner is shared by three edges, so we have 8 corners and 12 * 2 = 24 edge centers. So total vertices are 8 + 24 = 32. But wait, each face has a 3x3 grid of squares, which has 4x4 = 16 vertices per face. Since there are 6 faces, that would be 6 * 16 = 96, but each vertex is shared by multiple faces. Each corner is shared by three faces, and each edge center is shared by two faces.So, let's compute the total number of unique vertices:- 8 corners, each shared by 3 faces: 8 * 3 = 24- 12 edges, each with 2 edge centers (excluding corners), each shared by 2 faces: 12 * 2 * 2 = 48Total: 24 + 48 = 72, but this counts each vertex multiple times. To get the unique count, we have 8 corners + 12 * 2 = 24 edge centers, so 32 unique vertices.Wait, that makes sense because each edge has four vertices: two corners and two edge centers. So, 12 edges * 4 vertices = 48, but each corner is shared by three edges, so we have 8 corners and 12 * 2 = 24 edge centers, totaling 32 unique vertices.Okay, so the cube's surface has 32 vertices. Each diagonal on a small square connects two of these vertices. So, each diagonal is an edge in this graph. Since each small square has one diagonal, there are 54 diagonals (9 per face * 6 faces). But wait, each diagonal is an edge between two vertices, so the total number of edges in this graph is 54.But in graph theory, a closed, non-self-intersecting broken line is a cycle. So, we're being asked if there's a cycle that uses all 54 edges, which would be a Hamiltonian cycle on this graph. However, a Hamiltonian cycle visits each vertex exactly once, but in this case, we're using each edge exactly once, which would be an Eulerian circuit.Wait, no. An Eulerian circuit uses each edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. So, if we can traverse each diagonal exactly once and return to the starting point without lifting the pen, that would be an Eulerian circuit.But for an Eulerian circuit to exist, the graph must be connected, and every vertex must have an even degree. So, let's check the degrees of each vertex in this graph.Each vertex is a corner of some small squares. For a corner vertex (the 8 corners of the cube), how many diagonals meet there? Each corner is part of three faces. On each face, the corner is part of one small square. Each small square has two possible diagonals, but we're only drawing one per square. So, for each face, the corner is connected by one diagonal. Since the corner is part of three faces, it has three diagonals connected to it. So, the degree of each corner vertex is 3, which is odd.Similarly, for an edge center vertex (the ones along the edges, not the corners), each is part of two faces. Each face has a small square at that edge, so each edge center is connected by one diagonal per face. So, each edge center has degree 2, which is even.Wait, so the corner vertices have degree 3 (odd), and the edge center vertices have degree 2 (even). Since there are 8 corner vertices, each with odd degree, the graph has 8 vertices of odd degree. For an Eulerian circuit to exist, all vertices must have even degree. So, this graph doesn't have an Eulerian circuit because it has 8 vertices with odd degrees.But wait, the problem isn't asking to traverse each diagonal exactly once, but rather to draw diagonals such that they form a single closed loop. So, maybe it's not about using each diagonal, but rather selecting a subset of diagonals that form a loop.Wait, no, the problem says \\"draw a diagonal on each small square\\", so we have to use all 54 diagonals. So, it's about whether the graph formed by all these diagonals has an Eulerian circuit. But since we have 8 vertices with odd degrees, it's impossible to have an Eulerian circuit because Eulerian circuits require all vertices to have even degrees.Therefore, it's impossible to draw such diagonals on each small square to form a single closed, non-self-intersecting loop.Wait, but hold on. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the degrees. Let me double-check.Each corner vertex is part of three faces. On each face, the corner is part of one small square. Each small square has one diagonal. So, for each face, the corner is connected by one diagonal. Therefore, each corner is connected by three diagonals, one from each face it's part of. So, degree 3.Each edge center vertex is part of two faces. Each face has one small square at that edge, so each edge center is connected by one diagonal per face. So, degree 2.Therefore, yes, 8 vertices with degree 3 (odd) and 24 vertices with degree 2 (even). So, 8 vertices with odd degrees.In graph theory, an Eulerian trail (which is a path that uses each edge exactly once) requires exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. Since we have 8, which is more than 2, it's impossible to have an Eulerian trail or circuit.Therefore, it's impossible to draw such diagonals on each small square to form a single closed loop without self-intersecting.Wait, but the problem says \\"a closed, non-self-intersecting broken line\\". So, maybe it's not about using all diagonals, but rather selecting some diagonals to form such a loop, but the problem says \\"draw a diagonal on each small square\\", so we have to use all of them.Hmm, so if we have to use all diagonals, and the graph doesn't have an Eulerian circuit, then it's impossible.But maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's not about using all diagonals, but about drawing diagonals in such a way that the overall figure is a single closed loop, possibly reusing some diagonals or something.Wait, no, the problem says \\"draw a diagonal on each small square\\", so each small square must have one diagonal. So, all 54 diagonals must be drawn, and the question is whether these diagonals can form a single closed loop without self-intersecting.But as we saw, the graph formed by these diagonals has 8 vertices with odd degrees, making it impossible to have an Eulerian circuit, which would be required to traverse each diagonal exactly once in a closed loop.Therefore, the answer should be no, it's not possible.But wait, maybe there's another way. Maybe the loop doesn't have to traverse each diagonal exactly once, but rather, the diagonals are arranged such that they form a single loop, possibly overlapping or something. But the problem says \\"a closed, non-self-intersecting broken line\\", so overlapping is not allowed.Alternatively, maybe the loop can pass through some diagonals multiple times, but the problem says \\"draw a diagonal on each small square\\", so each diagonal is drawn once, but the loop can pass through the same diagonal multiple times? Wait, no, because each diagonal is a straight line on a square, so the loop can't pass through the same diagonal more than once without overlapping.Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about drawing a single continuous line that goes through all the diagonals, but not necessarily traversing each edge exactly once. But that seems similar to an Eulerian circuit.Wait, maybe it's about forming a single polygonal chain that covers all the diagonals, but that would require the graph to have an Eulerian trail, which it doesn't.Alternatively, maybe the problem is about tiling the cube's surface with a single closed loop made up of the diagonals, but not necessarily covering every diagonal.Wait, the problem says \\"draw a diagonal on each small square\\", so each small square must have a diagonal, and these diagonals must form a single closed loop. So, the loop must pass through each diagonal exactly once, which is an Eulerian circuit.But since the graph doesn't have an Eulerian circuit, it's impossible.Therefore, the answer is no, it's not possible.But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the diagonals can be arranged in such a way that they form multiple loops, but the problem specifies a single closed loop. So, even if there are multiple loops, it's not acceptable.Alternatively, maybe the problem allows the loop to pass through the same vertex multiple times, but without self-intersecting. But in that case, it's still a matter of whether the graph can be covered by a single cycle, which would require it to be a single cycle graph, but our graph is more complex.Wait, another thought: maybe the cube's surface can be unfolded into a net, and then the diagonals can be arranged on the net to form a single loop. But when folded back into a cube, the loop might intersect itself or not.But I'm not sure. Let me try to think of a simpler case. Suppose we have a single face of the cube. If I draw diagonals on each small square, can they form a loop on that face? For a 3x3 grid, drawing diagonals to form a loop.Wait, on a single face, a 3x3 grid of squares. If I draw diagonals on each square, can they form a single loop? Let's see.Each square has a diagonal, so 9 diagonals. Each diagonal connects two corners. To form a loop, the diagonals must connect end-to-end.But on a single face, the 3x3 grid has 4x4 = 16 vertices. Each diagonal connects two vertices. For a loop, we need a cycle that covers all 9 diagonals.But wait, 9 diagonals would mean 9 edges, but a cycle must have as many edges as vertices. Wait, no, a cycle with n edges has n vertices. So, if we have 9 edges, we need 9 vertices. But the face has 16 vertices, so it's impossible to cover all 9 diagonals in a single loop on a single face.Wait, but the problem is about the entire cube, not a single face. So, maybe the loop goes across multiple faces.But as we saw earlier, the graph has 8 vertices with odd degrees, making it impossible to have an Eulerian circuit.Therefore, it's impossible to draw such diagonals on each small square to form a single closed, non-self-intersecting loop.So, my conclusion is that it's not possible."},{"question":"For any (varphi inleft(0, frac{pi}{2}right)), which of the following inequalities holds?A.

The options are A, B, C, and D, each comparing different trigonometric functions. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me recall some basic properties of sine and cosine functions in the interval (0, π/2). Both sine and cosine are positive in this interval, and sine increases from 0 to 1 while cosine decreases from 1 to 0. Also, for any φ in (0, π/2), sin(φ) is less than φ, and cos(φ) is greater than sin(φ). Wait, is that right? Let me think.Actually, for φ in (0, π/2), sin(φ) < φ < tan(φ). So, sin(φ) is less than φ, and cos(φ) is positive but less than 1. Also, since φ is between 0 and π/2, cos(φ) is between 0 and 1, and sin(φ) is also between 0 and 1. So, both sin(φ) and cos(φ) are in (0,1) when φ is in (0, π/2).Now, let's look at the options:A. sin(sin φ) < cos φ < cos(cos φ)B. sin(sin φ) > cos φ > cos(cos φ)C. sin(cos φ) > cos φ > cos(sin φ)D. sin(cos φ) < cos φ < cos(sin φ)I need to figure out the relationships between sin(sin φ), cos φ, and cos(cos φ), and similarly between sin(cos φ), cos φ, and cos(sin φ).Let me tackle option A first: sin(sin φ) < cos φ < cos(cos φ). Is this true?Well, let's consider the inner functions first. Since φ is in (0, π/2), sin φ is in (0,1). So, sin(sin φ) is sin of a number between 0 and 1. Since sin is increasing on [0, π/2], sin(sin φ) will be between sin(0)=0 and sin(1)≈0.8415.Similarly, cos φ is in (0,1) as well, decreasing from 1 to 0 as φ increases from 0 to π/2.Now, is sin(sin φ) less than cos φ? Let's test with φ = π/4, which is 45 degrees.sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071So, sin(sin(π/4)) = sin(√2/2) ≈ sin(0.7071) ≈ 0.6496cos(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071So, 0.6496 < 0.7071, which is true. So, sin(sin φ) < cos φ holds for φ=π/4.Now, is cos φ < cos(cos φ)? Let's check.cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071cos(cos(π/4)) = cos(√2/2) ≈ cos(0.7071) ≈ 0.7648So, 0.7071 < 0.7648, which is true. So, for φ=π/4, option A holds.But is this true for all φ in (0, π/2)? Let's test another value, say φ approaching 0.As φ approaches 0, sin φ approaches 0, so sin(sin φ) approaches sin(0)=0.cos φ approaches 1, so cos(cos φ) approaches cos(1)≈0.5403.So, as φ approaches 0, sin(sin φ) approaches 0, which is less than cos φ approaching 1. Also, cos φ approaches 1, which is greater than cos(cos φ) approaching ~0.5403. So, 0 < 1 > 0.5403, which means cos φ > cos(cos φ) as φ approaches 0. Wait, but in option A, it's cos φ < cos(cos φ). So, as φ approaches 0, cos φ approaches 1, which is greater than cos(cos φ)≈0.5403. So, cos φ > cos(cos φ) near φ=0, which contradicts the second inequality in option A.So, for φ near 0, the second inequality in A is false. Therefore, option A is not valid for all φ in (0, π/2).Hmm, so A is not the correct answer.Let me check option B: sin(sin φ) > cos φ > cos(cos φ). Let's test φ=π/4 again.sin(sin(π/4))≈0.6496, cos(π/4)=√2/2≈0.7071, cos(cos(π/4))≈0.7648.So, 0.6496 < 0.7071 < 0.7648. So, sin(sin φ) < cos φ < cos(cos φ). So, the inequalities in B are reversed; sin(sin φ) is less than cos φ, not greater. So, B is false for φ=π/4.What about near φ=0? As φ approaches 0, sin(sin φ) approaches 0, cos φ approaches 1, and cos(cos φ) approaches ~0.5403. So, near φ=0, sin(sin φ) < cos φ, and cos φ > cos(cos φ). So, again, the inequalities in B are reversed. So, B is not correct.Moving on to option C: sin(cos φ) > cos φ > cos(sin φ). Let's test φ=π/4.cos(π/4)=√2/2≈0.7071sin(cos φ)=sin(√2/2)≈sin(0.7071)≈0.6496cos(sin φ)=cos(√2/2)≈cos(0.7071)≈0.7648So, sin(cos φ)=0.6496, cos φ=0.7071, cos(sin φ)=0.7648.So, 0.6496 < 0.7071 < 0.7648. So, sin(cos φ) < cos φ < cos(sin φ). So, the inequalities in C are reversed; sin(cos φ) < cos φ, and cos φ < cos(sin φ). So, C is false for φ=π/4.What about near φ=0? As φ approaches 0, cos φ approaches 1, so sin(cos φ) approaches sin(1)≈0.8415, cos φ approaches 1, and cos(sin φ) approaches cos(0)=1.Wait, as φ approaches 0, sin(cos φ) approaches sin(1)≈0.8415, which is less than 1, which is cos φ approaching 1. So, sin(cos φ) < cos φ near φ=0.Similarly, cos(sin φ) approaches cos(0)=1, so cos φ approaches 1, so cos φ approaches the same value as cos(sin φ). But actually, sin φ approaches 0, so cos(sin φ) approaches cos(0)=1, same as cos φ approaches 1. But for small φ>0, cos φ is slightly less than 1, and cos(sin φ) is slightly less than 1 as well, but how do they compare?Wait, for small φ>0, sin φ ≈ φ, so cos(sin φ) ≈ cos(φ) ≈ 1 - φ²/2. Similarly, cos φ ≈ 1 - φ²/2. So, they are approximately equal for small φ, but actually, since sin φ < φ for φ>0, cos(sin φ) > cos(φ) because cosine is decreasing on (0, π/2). So, cos(sin φ) > cos φ for φ in (0, π/2). Therefore, near φ=0, cos φ < cos(sin φ). So, in option C, it's cos φ > cos(sin φ), which is false. So, C is not correct.Now, option D: sin(cos φ) < cos φ < cos(sin φ). Let's test φ=π/4.sin(cos φ)=sin(√2/2)≈0.6496cos φ=√2/2≈0.7071cos(sin φ)=cos(√2/2)≈0.7648So, 0.6496 < 0.7071 < 0.7648. So, sin(cos φ) < cos φ < cos(sin φ). So, D holds for φ=π/4.What about near φ=0? As φ approaches 0, sin(cos φ) approaches sin(1)≈0.8415, cos φ approaches 1, and cos(sin φ) approaches cos(0)=1.So, sin(cos φ) approaches ~0.8415, which is less than 1, so sin(cos φ) < cos φ. Also, cos φ approaches 1, and cos(sin φ) approaches 1, but for small φ>0, cos(sin φ) > cos φ because sin φ < φ, and cosine is decreasing. So, cos(sin φ) > cos φ. Therefore, near φ=0, sin(cos φ) < cos φ < cos(sin φ). So, D holds near φ=0.What about near φ=π/2? Let's test φ approaching π/2.As φ approaches π/2, sin φ approaches 1, cos φ approaches 0.So, sin(cos φ) approaches sin(0)=0.cos φ approaches 0.cos(sin φ) approaches cos(1)≈0.5403.So, near φ=π/2, sin(cos φ) approaches 0, which is less than cos φ approaching 0, but wait, cos φ is approaching 0 from the positive side, so sin(cos φ) approaches 0 from the positive side as well. So, sin(cos φ) approaches 0, which is equal to cos φ approaching 0, but actually, for φ slightly less than π/2, cos φ is a small positive number, and sin(cos φ) is sin of a small positive number, which is approximately equal to cos φ. But since sin(x) < x for x>0, sin(cos φ) < cos φ for φ in (0, π/2). So, even near π/2, sin(cos φ) < cos φ.Also, cos(sin φ) approaches cos(1)≈0.5403, which is greater than cos φ approaching 0. So, cos φ < cos(sin φ) near φ=π/2.Therefore, D holds near φ=π/2 as well.So, putting it all together, option D seems to hold for φ=π/4, near φ=0, and near φ=π/2. Therefore, D is the correct answer.Wait, just to make sure, let me test another value, say φ=π/6 (30 degrees).sin(π/6)=1/2, cos(π/6)=√3/2≈0.8660.So, sin(cos φ)=sin(√3/2)≈sin(0.8660)≈0.7616cos φ=√3/2≈0.8660cos(sin φ)=cos(1/2)≈cos(0.5)≈0.8776So, sin(cos φ)=0.7616 < cos φ=0.8660 < cos(sin φ)=0.8776. So, D holds here as well.Another test at φ=π/3 (60 degrees).sin(π/3)=√3/2≈0.8660, cos(π/3)=1/2=0.5.sin(cos φ)=sin(0.5)≈0.4794cos φ=0.5cos(sin φ)=cos(√3/2)≈cos(0.8660)≈0.6459So, sin(cos φ)=0.4794 < cos φ=0.5 < cos(sin φ)=0.6459. So, D holds here too.Therefore, after testing multiple points and considering the behavior near the endpoints, option D consistently holds. So, I think D is the correct answer."},{"question":"Given a sequence {a_n} that satisfies a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} (n geq 3, n in mathbb{N}^*), and its sum of the first n terms is S_n. If S_9 = 6 and S_{10} = 5, then the value of a_1 is.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a sequence defined by a recurrence relation, and I need to find the value of ( a_1 ). Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the sequence is given by ( a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} ) for ( n geq 3 ). That means each term is the difference between the two previous terms. Interesting. So, it's a linear recurrence relation of order 2. I remember that for such recursions, sometimes we can find a pattern or even a closed-form expression.The problem also mentions the sum of the first ( n ) terms, denoted as ( S_n ). We are told that ( S_9 = 6 ) and ( S_{10} = 5 ). So, the sum of the first 9 terms is 6, and the sum of the first 10 terms is 5. That seems a bit counterintuitive because adding another term (the 10th term) makes the sum decrease by 1. So, the 10th term must be negative, right? Because ( S_{10} = S_9 + a_{10} ), so ( 5 = 6 + a_{10} ) implies ( a_{10} = -1 ).Hmm, so ( a_{10} = -1 ). Let me note that down. Maybe this will help later.Now, I need to find ( a_1 ). Let me think about how to approach this. Since the sequence is defined by a recurrence relation, perhaps I can express ( a_n ) in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ), and then find a relationship using the sums ( S_9 ) and ( S_{10} ).Let me write out the first few terms of the sequence in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ):- ( a_1 = a_1 )- ( a_2 = a_2 )- ( a_3 = a_2 - a_1 )- ( a_4 = a_3 - a_2 = (a_2 - a_1) - a_2 = -a_1 )- ( a_5 = a_4 - a_3 = (-a_1) - (a_2 - a_1) = -a_1 - a_2 + a_1 = -a_2 )- ( a_6 = a_5 - a_4 = (-a_2) - (-a_1) = -a_2 + a_1 )- ( a_7 = a_6 - a_5 = (-a_2 + a_1) - (-a_2) = -a_2 + a_1 + a_2 = a_1 )- ( a_8 = a_7 - a_6 = a_1 - (-a_2 + a_1) = a_1 + a_2 - a_1 = a_2 )- ( a_9 = a_8 - a_7 = a_2 - a_1 )- ( a_{10} = a_9 - a_8 = (a_2 - a_1) - a_2 = -a_1 )Wait a second, so ( a_7 = a_1 ) and ( a_8 = a_2 ). That means the sequence is periodic with period 6? Because ( a_7 = a_1 ) and ( a_8 = a_2 ), so it's repeating every 6 terms. Let me check:- ( a_1 = a_1 )- ( a_2 = a_2 )- ( a_3 = a_2 - a_1 )- ( a_4 = -a_1 )- ( a_5 = -a_2 )- ( a_6 = -a_2 + a_1 )- ( a_7 = a_1 )- ( a_8 = a_2 )- ( a_9 = a_2 - a_1 )- ( a_{10} = -a_1 )- ( a_{11} = -a_2 )- ( a_{12} = -a_2 + a_1 )- And so on...Yes, it seems like the sequence repeats every 6 terms. So, the period is 6. That's useful because if the sequence is periodic, the sums ( S_n ) will have some periodic behavior as well.Given that, let me try to compute the sum ( S_n ) in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ). Since the sequence repeats every 6 terms, the sum of each block of 6 terms will be the same. Let me compute the sum of the first 6 terms:( S_6 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 )Substituting the expressions in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ):( S_6 = a_1 + a_2 + (a_2 - a_1) + (-a_1) + (-a_2) + (-a_2 + a_1) )Let me simplify this term by term:1. ( a_1 )2. ( + a_2 )3. ( + a_2 - a_1 )4. ( - a_1 )5. ( - a_2 )6. ( - a_2 + a_1 )Now, let's combine like terms:- ( a_1 - a_1 - a_1 + a_1 = 0 ) (for the ( a_1 ) terms)- ( a_2 + a_2 - a_2 - a_2 = 0 ) (for the ( a_2 ) terms)So, ( S_6 = 0 ). Interesting, the sum of each 6-term block is zero. That might simplify things.Given that, let's see how ( S_9 ) and ( S_{10} ) can be expressed.Since 9 divided by 6 is 1 with a remainder of 3, ( S_9 ) is equal to the sum of one full period (which is 0) plus the sum of the first 3 terms.Similarly, ( S_{10} ) is equal to the sum of one full period (0) plus the sum of the first 4 terms.So, let me write that:( S_9 = S_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 0 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 )But ( a_7 = a_1 ), ( a_8 = a_2 ), ( a_9 = a_2 - a_1 ). So,( S_9 = a_1 + a_2 + (a_2 - a_1) = a_1 + a_2 + a_2 - a_1 = 2a_2 )Similarly, ( S_{10} = S_9 + a_{10} = 2a_2 + a_{10} )But we know ( S_9 = 6 ) and ( S_{10} = 5 ). So,From ( S_9 = 6 ):( 2a_2 = 6 ) => ( a_2 = 3 )From ( S_{10} = 5 ):( 2a_2 + a_{10} = 5 )We already know ( a_2 = 3 ), so:( 2*3 + a_{10} = 5 ) => ( 6 + a_{10} = 5 ) => ( a_{10} = -1 )But earlier, we had ( a_{10} = -a_1 ). So,( -a_1 = -1 ) => ( a_1 = 1 )Wait, so is that it? Let me verify.Given ( a_1 = 1 ) and ( a_2 = 3 ), let's compute the sequence up to ( a_{10} ):- ( a_1 = 1 )- ( a_2 = 3 )- ( a_3 = a_2 - a_1 = 3 - 1 = 2 )- ( a_4 = a_3 - a_2 = 2 - 3 = -1 )- ( a_5 = a_4 - a_3 = -1 - 2 = -3 )- ( a_6 = a_5 - a_4 = -3 - (-1) = -3 + 1 = -2 )- ( a_7 = a_6 - a_5 = -2 - (-3) = -2 + 3 = 1 ) (which is ( a_1 ))- ( a_8 = a_7 - a_6 = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3 ) (which is ( a_2 ))- ( a_9 = a_8 - a_7 = 3 - 1 = 2 )- ( a_{10} = a_9 - a_8 = 2 - 3 = -1 )Now, let's compute ( S_9 ):( S_9 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 )Substituting the values:( 1 + 3 + 2 + (-1) + (-3) + (-2) + 1 + 3 + 2 )Let's compute step by step:1. 1 + 3 = 42. 4 + 2 = 63. 6 + (-1) = 54. 5 + (-3) = 25. 2 + (-2) = 06. 0 + 1 = 17. 1 + 3 = 48. 4 + 2 = 6So, ( S_9 = 6 ). That's correct.Now, ( S_{10} = S_9 + a_{10} = 6 + (-1) = 5 ). Perfect, that matches the given information.Therefore, ( a_1 = 1 ) is indeed the correct answer.But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning, let me recap:1. The recurrence relation ( a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} ) leads to a periodic sequence with period 6.2. Calculating the sum ( S_6 ) gives 0, which simplifies the calculation of ( S_9 ) and ( S_{10} ).3. ( S_9 ) is the sum of one full period (0) plus the first 3 terms of the next period, which simplifies to ( 2a_2 ).4. ( S_{10} ) is ( S_9 + a_{10} ), and since ( S_9 = 6 ), we find ( a_{10} = -1 ).5. Knowing ( a_{10} = -a_1 ), we find ( a_1 = 1 ).6. Verifying by computing the sequence and the sums confirms the result.So, I think my solution is solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations or reasoning.**Final Answer**The value of ( a_1 ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha at the animal rescue center where they had gone to take part in the animal saving day event.

The line is given in parametric form with parameter t, and the curve is also given in parametric form with parameter θ. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right.The line is:x = t - 1y = 2 - tAnd the curve is:x = 3 cos θy = 2 sin θHmm, so I need to find how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations. That means I need to find values of t and θ such that when I plug them into their respective equations, the x and y values are the same.Maybe I can substitute the parametric equations into each other. Let me think. Since both x and y are expressed in terms of their parameters, I can set them equal and solve for t and θ.So, from the line, x = t - 1 and y = 2 - t. From the curve, x = 3 cos θ and y = 2 sin θ.So, setting x equal: t - 1 = 3 cos θAnd setting y equal: 2 - t = 2 sin θSo now I have two equations:1. t - 1 = 3 cos θ2. 2 - t = 2 sin θI can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the possible values of t and θ. Since both equations involve t and θ, maybe I can express t from one equation and substitute into the other.Let me solve equation 1 for t:t = 3 cos θ + 1Now, plug this into equation 2:2 - (3 cos θ + 1) = 2 sin θSimplify the left side:2 - 3 cos θ - 1 = 2 sin θ(2 - 1) - 3 cos θ = 2 sin θ1 - 3 cos θ = 2 sin θSo now I have:1 - 3 cos θ = 2 sin θHmm, this is an equation involving sin θ and cos θ. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the trigonometric functions, but I have to be careful because squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.But before I do that, let me rearrange the equation:1 = 2 sin θ + 3 cos θSo, 2 sin θ + 3 cos θ = 1This looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine. I remember that expressions like A sin θ + B cos θ can be written as C sin(θ + φ) or C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.Let me recall the formula: A sin θ + B cos θ = C sin(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²) and tan φ = B/A.Wait, actually, it's either sine or cosine depending on how you write it. Let me confirm.Alternatively, it can be written as C cos(θ - φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²) and tan φ = A/B.Wait, let me check:The identity is A sin θ + B cos θ = C sin(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²) and φ = arctan(B/A). Or is it arctan(A/B)? Hmm, maybe I should derive it.Let me suppose that 2 sin θ + 3 cos θ can be written as R sin(θ + α), where R is the amplitude.Expanding R sin(θ + α) = R sin θ cos α + R cos θ sin α.Comparing coefficients:2 = R cos α3 = R sin αSo, R² = 2² + 3² = 4 + 9 = 13, so R = sqrt(13).Then, tan α = (R sin α)/(R cos α) = 3/2, so α = arctan(3/2).Therefore, 2 sin θ + 3 cos θ = sqrt(13) sin(θ + arctan(3/2)).So, the equation becomes:sqrt(13) sin(θ + arctan(3/2)) = 1So, sin(θ + arctan(3/2)) = 1 / sqrt(13)Now, 1 / sqrt(13) is approximately 0.277, which is between -1 and 1, so there are solutions.The general solution for sin φ = k is φ = arcsin(k) + 2πn or φ = π - arcsin(k) + 2πn, where n is any integer.So, θ + arctan(3/2) = arcsin(1/sqrt(13)) + 2πn or θ + arctan(3/2) = π - arcsin(1/sqrt(13)) + 2πn.Therefore, θ = -arctan(3/2) + arcsin(1/sqrt(13)) + 2πn or θ = -arctan(3/2) + π - arcsin(1/sqrt(13)) + 2πn.So, θ has two solutions in each period of 2π. Since θ is a parameter, it can take any real value, but since sine and cosine are periodic with period 2π, we can consider θ in [0, 2π) for the number of solutions.Therefore, in the interval [0, 2π), there are two solutions for θ.Wait, but before I conclude that, let me check if these solutions are valid.Because sometimes when we square equations, we can introduce extraneous solutions, but in this case, I didn't square; I used a trigonometric identity. So, perhaps both solutions are valid.But let me verify.Alternatively, maybe I can solve the equation 2 sin θ + 3 cos θ = 1 numerically or graphically to see how many solutions there are.But since I can't graph it right now, let me think about the maximum and minimum of 2 sin θ + 3 cos θ.The maximum value is sqrt(2² + 3²) = sqrt(13) ≈ 3.605, and the minimum is -sqrt(13) ≈ -3.605.Since 1 is between -sqrt(13) and sqrt(13), the equation 2 sin θ + 3 cos θ = 1 has two solutions in [0, 2π). So, that means θ has two solutions.Therefore, each θ corresponds to a point on the curve, and each t corresponds to a point on the line. So, does that mean there are two intersection points?Wait, but let me make sure. Because sometimes, even if θ has two solutions, the corresponding t might lead to the same point, but in this case, since θ is parameterizing the curve, each θ gives a unique point on the curve, and t is parameterizing the line, each t gives a unique point on the line. So, if θ has two solutions, then t will have two corresponding solutions, leading to two distinct points of intersection.But just to be thorough, let me solve for θ and then find t, and then check if the points are indeed distinct.So, let's compute θ.We have:θ = -arctan(3/2) + arcsin(1/sqrt(13)) + 2πnandθ = -arctan(3/2) + π - arcsin(1/sqrt(13)) + 2πnLet me compute the numerical values.First, arctan(3/2). Let me compute that.arctan(3/2) is approximately arctan(1.5) ≈ 56.31 degrees, which is approximately 0.9828 radians.arcsin(1/sqrt(13)) is arcsin(1/3.6055) ≈ arcsin(0.277) ≈ 0.283 radians, which is about 16.26 degrees.So, the first solution:θ ≈ -0.9828 + 0.283 ≈ -0.6998 radians.But since θ is periodic, we can add 2π to get it into [0, 2π):-0.6998 + 2π ≈ -0.6998 + 6.283 ≈ 5.583 radians.The second solution:θ ≈ -0.9828 + π - 0.283 ≈ -0.9828 + 3.1416 - 0.283 ≈ 1.8758 radians.So, θ ≈ 1.8758 radians and θ ≈ 5.583 radians.So, two distinct θ values in [0, 2π). Therefore, two points on the curve.Now, let's find the corresponding t for each θ.From equation 1: t = 3 cos θ + 1First, for θ ≈ 1.8758 radians:cos(1.8758) ≈ cos(107.5 degrees) ≈ -0.3So, t ≈ 3*(-0.3) + 1 ≈ -0.9 + 1 ≈ 0.1Similarly, sin(1.8758) ≈ sin(107.5 degrees) ≈ 0.95So, from the curve, y = 2 sin θ ≈ 2*0.95 ≈ 1.9From the line, y = 2 - t ≈ 2 - 0.1 ≈ 1.9, which matches.Similarly, for θ ≈ 5.583 radians:cos(5.583) ≈ cos(320 degrees) ≈ 0.766So, t ≈ 3*0.766 + 1 ≈ 2.298 + 1 ≈ 3.298sin(5.583) ≈ sin(320 degrees) ≈ -0.6428So, from the curve, y = 2 sin θ ≈ 2*(-0.6428) ≈ -1.2856From the line, y = 2 - t ≈ 2 - 3.298 ≈ -1.298, which is approximately equal, considering rounding errors.So, both solutions give valid points on both the line and the curve, so both are intersection points.Therefore, the number of intersection points is 2.Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure that when I squared or did the trigonometric identity, I didn't introduce any extraneous solutions. But in this case, I didn't square; I just used the identity to rewrite the equation, so both solutions should be valid.Alternatively, maybe I can solve the system without using trigonometric identities.Let me try another approach.From the line:x = t - 1y = 2 - tSo, I can express t from the first equation: t = x + 1Plug into the second equation: y = 2 - (x + 1) = 1 - xSo, the equation of the line is y = 1 - x.Now, the curve is given parametrically as x = 3 cos θ, y = 2 sin θ.So, to find the intersection points, substitute x and y into the line equation:2 sin θ = 1 - 3 cos θWhich is the same as:2 sin θ + 3 cos θ = 1Which is exactly the equation I had before. So, same result.So, solving 2 sin θ + 3 cos θ = 1, which we found has two solutions in [0, 2π). So, two intersection points.Alternatively, maybe I can express the curve as an ellipse.Because x = 3 cos θ, y = 2 sin θ, so (x/3)^2 + (y/2)^2 = cos² θ + sin² θ = 1So, the curve is an ellipse with semi-major axis 3 along the x-axis and semi-minor axis 2 along the y-axis.And the line is y = 1 - x.So, to find the number of intersection points between the line and the ellipse, we can substitute y = 1 - x into the ellipse equation.So, let's do that.The ellipse equation is (x/3)^2 + (y/2)^2 = 1Substitute y = 1 - x:(x/3)^2 + ((1 - x)/2)^2 = 1Let me compute this:(x²)/9 + ((1 - x)²)/4 = 1Multiply both sides by 36 to eliminate denominators:4x² + 9(1 - 2x + x²) = 36Expand:4x² + 9 - 18x + 9x² = 36Combine like terms:(4x² + 9x²) + (-18x) + (9) = 3613x² - 18x + 9 = 36Subtract 36 from both sides:13x² - 18x - 27 = 0So, quadratic equation: 13x² - 18x - 27 = 0Let me compute the discriminant:D = b² - 4ac = (-18)^2 - 4*13*(-27) = 324 + 1404 = 17281728 is a perfect cube, 12³, but as a square, sqrt(1728) = sqrt(144*12) = 12*sqrt(12) = 12*2*sqrt(3) = 24 sqrt(3)So, the solutions are:x = [18 ± 24 sqrt(3)] / (2*13) = [18 ± 24 sqrt(3)] / 26 = [9 ± 12 sqrt(3)] / 13So, two solutions for x:x₁ = (9 + 12 sqrt(3))/13x₂ = (9 - 12 sqrt(3))/13Therefore, two x-values, which correspond to two points on the line and the ellipse, so two intersection points.Therefore, the number of intersection points is 2.Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute the approximate values.Compute x₁:12 sqrt(3) ≈ 12*1.732 ≈ 20.784So, 9 + 20.784 ≈ 29.784Divide by 13: ≈ 2.291x₂:9 - 20.784 ≈ -11.784Divide by 13: ≈ -0.906So, x ≈ 2.291 and x ≈ -0.906Then, y = 1 - x:For x ≈ 2.291, y ≈ 1 - 2.291 ≈ -1.291For x ≈ -0.906, y ≈ 1 - (-0.906) ≈ 1.906So, the two points are approximately (2.291, -1.291) and (-0.906, 1.906)Now, let me check if these points lie on both the line and the ellipse.First, for (2.291, -1.291):Check the line: y = 1 - x ≈ 1 - 2.291 ≈ -1.291, which matches.Check the ellipse: (2.291/3)^2 + (-1.291/2)^2 ≈ (0.7637)^2 + (-0.6455)^2 ≈ 0.583 + 0.416 ≈ 0.999, which is approximately 1, considering rounding errors.Similarly, for (-0.906, 1.906):Check the line: y = 1 - (-0.906) ≈ 1.906, which matches.Check the ellipse: (-0.906/3)^2 + (1.906/2)^2 ≈ (-0.302)^2 + (0.953)^2 ≈ 0.091 + 0.908 ≈ 1.0, which is exactly 1.So, both points lie on both the line and the ellipse, confirming that there are two intersection points.Therefore, the number of intersection points is 2.**Final Answer**The number of intersection points is boxed{2}."},{"question":"In a 9 times 9 grid, there are a total of 81 small squares. A number is written in each small square. If it is only required that each row and each column have at most three different numbers, then it is guaranteed that there exists a number in the grid that appears at least n times in a certain row and at least n times in a certain column. What is the maximum value of n? And prove your conclusion.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a 9x9 grid where each small square has a number. The condition is that each row and each column can have at most three different numbers. I need to figure out the maximum value of n such that there's a number that appears at least n times in some row and also at least n times in some column. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.First, let me understand the constraints. Each row can have at most three different numbers. That means in any given row, the numbers can repeat, but there can't be more than three distinct numbers. Similarly, each column can also have at most three different numbers. So, the grid is somewhat restricted in terms of the variety of numbers it can contain.Now, the question is about guaranteeing that there's a number which appears at least n times in some row and at least n times in some column. I need to find the maximum such n. So, regardless of how the numbers are arranged in the grid, as long as the constraints are satisfied, there must be at least one number that appears n times in some row and n times in some column. I need to find the largest possible n for which this is always true.Let me think about how numbers can be distributed in a row. Since each row can have at most three different numbers, the numbers in a row must repeat. The maximum number of times a single number can appear in a row is 9, but that would mean all other numbers are the same, which is allowed since only three different numbers are allowed. However, in reality, the distribution might be more spread out.Wait, but we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the numbers are spread out as much as possible to minimize the maximum number of repetitions in any row or column. So, to maximize n, we need to find the minimum upper bound on the number of times a number must appear in some row and column.Let me think in terms of the pigeonhole principle. Since each row can have at most three different numbers, each number in a row can appear multiple times. If a row has three different numbers, the maximum number of times any single number can appear is 9, but that's only if all other squares are the same number. However, in the most balanced case, each number would appear roughly 3 times, since 9 divided by 3 is 3. So, in a balanced row, each number appears 3 times.Similarly, for a column, each column can have at most three different numbers, so in the most balanced case, each number appears 3 times.But the problem is asking for a number that appears at least n times in some row and at least n times in some column. So, it's not about all rows or all columns, but just that there exists at least one row and one column where a particular number appears n times.Wait, so maybe it's possible that in some rows, a number appears more times, while in others, it appears fewer. Similarly for columns. So, the question is, regardless of how the grid is filled, there must be some number that in some row appears at least n times, and in some column appears at least n times.I need to find the maximum n such that this is always true.Let me think about the maximum possible n. If n is too large, say 5, maybe it's not guaranteed because perhaps the numbers can be arranged such that no number appears 5 times in any row or column. But if n is smaller, like 3, it might be guaranteed.Wait, but 3 is the number of different numbers per row and column. So, if each row has three different numbers, each appearing 3 times, then in that case, each number appears exactly 3 times in the row. Similarly, in the column, each number appears exactly 3 times. So, in that case, n would be 3.But is 3 the maximum? Or can we get a higher n?Wait, maybe not. Because if the grid is arranged such that each row has three numbers each appearing 3 times, and each column also has three numbers each appearing 3 times, then in that case, n would be 3. But perhaps in some grids, you can have a number appearing more times in a row or column, but the question is about the guarantee. So, regardless of how the grid is arranged, there must be a number that appears at least n times in some row and some column.Therefore, to find the maximum n, we need to find the minimal upper bound such that in any grid satisfying the given conditions, there exists a number that appears at least n times in some row and some column.Let me think about the total number of cells. There are 81 cells. Each row has 9 cells, each column has 9 cells. Each row has at most three different numbers, so each row has at least 3 numbers, each appearing at least once, but potentially more.Wait, actually, no. Each row can have at most three different numbers, but it doesn't specify a minimum. So, a row could have just one number repeated nine times, or two numbers, or three numbers.Similarly, a column could have one, two, or three different numbers.So, the grid could have some rows with only one number, and some with three.But the problem is about guaranteeing that some number appears at least n times in some row and some column.So, perhaps we can think about the maximum minimal n.Let me try to think of an example where n is as small as possible, but still, in any grid, n is at least that.Wait, maybe using double counting or something.Alternatively, perhaps considering that each row has at most three different numbers, so each row has at least 3 numbers, each appearing at least once, but potentially more.Wait, no, actually, a row could have one number appearing 9 times, so the number of different numbers is 1, or two numbers, say 5 and 4 times, or three numbers, say 3, 3, 3 times.Similarly, for columns.So, perhaps in the case where each row has three numbers each appearing 3 times, and each column has three numbers each appearing 3 times, then n would be 3.But if we can arrange the grid such that in every row and every column, no number appears more than 3 times, then n would be 3.But is that possible? Or is it possible that in some grids, numbers have to appear more times?Wait, perhaps not. If you have a grid where each row has three numbers each appearing three times, and each column also has three numbers each appearing three times, then n is 3.But maybe in some grids, you can have higher n.Wait, but the question is about the maximum n that is guaranteed. So, even if some grids can have higher n, we need the minimal n such that every grid must have at least n. So, the maximum minimal n.So, perhaps n is 3.But wait, let me think again.Suppose that in every row, each number appears at most 3 times. Then, since each row has 9 cells, and at most three different numbers, each number must appear at least 3 times in each row. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.Wait, if a row has three different numbers, each can appear at least 3 times, but they could also appear more. For example, one number could appear 4 times, another 3 times, and another 2 times.But the problem is that we need to find a number that appears at least n times in some row and some column.So, perhaps the minimal maximum is 3.But let me try to think of a grid where no number appears more than 3 times in any row or column.Is that possible?Yes, for example, if each row is divided into three groups of three cells, each group containing the same number, and each column is also divided similarly.But in that case, each number appears exactly 3 times in each row and column.Wait, but in that case, n would be 3, because in each row, each number appears 3 times, and in each column, each number appears 3 times.But is that the minimal case? Or can we have a grid where numbers appear more times?Wait, but the question is about the maximum n that is guaranteed. So, even if some grids have higher n, we need the minimal n that is always true.Wait, no, actually, it's the opposite. We need the maximum n such that in every grid, there exists a number that appears at least n times in some row and some column.So, to find the maximum n, we need to find the minimal upper bound such that in every grid, there is at least one number that appears n times in some row and n times in some column.So, perhaps n is 3, because in some grids, you can arrange it so that no number appears more than 3 times in any row or column, but in others, you might have higher.But wait, actually, in any grid, regardless of how you arrange it, you must have at least one number that appears at least 3 times in some row and 3 times in some column.Wait, but is that necessarily true?Wait, let's think about it. Suppose we have a grid where each row has three numbers, each appearing 3 times, and each column also has three numbers, each appearing 3 times. Then, in that case, n is 3.But if we have a grid where some rows have numbers appearing more than 3 times, then n could be higher.But the question is about the maximum n that is guaranteed, regardless of the grid. So, even if some grids have n=3, but others have higher, we need the minimal n such that every grid has at least n.Wait, no, actually, it's the opposite. The maximum n such that in every grid, there exists a number that appears at least n times in some row and some column.So, if in some grids, the maximum n is 3, but in others, it's higher, then the maximum n that is guaranteed is 3.But wait, perhaps it's higher.Wait, let me think about the total number of cells. Each row has 9 cells, and each row can have at most three different numbers. So, by the pigeonhole principle, in each row, at least one number must appear at least ceiling(9/3)=3 times.Similarly, in each column, at least one number must appear at least 3 times.But the question is about a single number that appears at least n times in some row and at least n times in some column.So, perhaps n is 3, because in each row, there's a number that appears at least 3 times, and in each column, there's a number that appears at least 3 times.But does that guarantee that there's a number that appears at least 3 times in some row and at least 3 times in some column?Wait, not necessarily. Because the number that appears 3 times in a row might be different from the number that appears 3 times in a column.But the question is about the same number appearing at least n times in some row and at least n times in some column.So, perhaps we need to consider that there must be some overlap.Wait, maybe using double counting or something.Let me think about the total number of pairs (row, column) where a number appears at least n times in the row and at least n times in the column.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps consider that each row has a number appearing at least 3 times, and each column has a number appearing at least 3 times. So, in the entire grid, there are 9 rows, each contributing at least one number that appears 3 times in that row, and 9 columns, each contributing at least one number that appears 3 times in that column.But how do these numbers overlap?Wait, maybe using the pigeonhole principle again. There are 9 rows, each with a number appearing at least 3 times. So, there are 9 such numbers (possibly the same number across rows). Similarly, 9 columns, each with a number appearing at least 3 times.But the total number of distinct numbers in the grid is not specified, so it could be more or less.Wait, but each row has at most three different numbers, so the total number of distinct numbers in the grid is at most 9*3=27, but actually, it could be less if numbers are shared across rows.Similarly, each column has at most three different numbers, so the total number of distinct numbers is at most 9*3=27.But the exact number isn't specified.Wait, perhaps we can think of the numbers that appear in multiple rows and columns.Wait, maybe considering that each number that appears in a row at least 3 times must also appear in some column at least 3 times.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of incidences.Wait, let me think about it differently.Suppose that in each row, there is a number that appears at least 3 times. So, for each row, we can assign a number that appears at least 3 times in that row.Similarly, for each column, we can assign a number that appears at least 3 times in that column.Now, we have 9 numbers assigned to rows and 9 numbers assigned to columns.If any number is assigned to both a row and a column, then that number appears at least 3 times in that row and at least 3 times in that column.So, if there is an overlap between the row numbers and column numbers, then we have our n=3.But is this overlap guaranteed?Well, if the total number of distinct numbers assigned to rows and columns is less than 18, then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be an overlap.But how many distinct numbers are there?Wait, each row can have up to three different numbers, but we're only assigning one number per row (the one that appears at least 3 times). Similarly, for columns.So, the total number of distinct numbers assigned to rows is at most 9, since each row can have up to three different numbers, but we're only picking one per row.Similarly, the total number of distinct numbers assigned to columns is at most 9.So, the total number of distinct numbers assigned to rows and columns is at most 18.But the total number of numbers in the grid is at least... Well, it could be as low as 1 (if the entire grid is filled with the same number) or up to 27.But in our case, each row has at most three different numbers, so the total number of distinct numbers in the grid is at most 9*3=27.But the numbers assigned to rows and columns are subsets of these.Wait, but the numbers assigned to rows are 9 numbers, each appearing at least 3 times in their respective rows.Similarly, the numbers assigned to columns are 9 numbers, each appearing at least 3 times in their respective columns.Now, if any of these 9 row numbers is also one of the 9 column numbers, then that number appears at least 3 times in a row and at least 3 times in a column.So, the question is, is it possible that all 9 row numbers are distinct from all 9 column numbers?If yes, then there is no overlap, and thus, no number appears at least 3 times in both a row and a column.But if it's not possible, then there must be an overlap, meaning n=3 is guaranteed.So, can we have a grid where the 9 row numbers (each appearing at least 3 times in their row) are all distinct from the 9 column numbers (each appearing at least 3 times in their column)?If yes, then n cannot be guaranteed to be 3.But if no, then n=3 is guaranteed.So, let's try to construct such a grid.Suppose we have 9 distinct numbers for the rows, each appearing 3 times in their respective rows.Similarly, have 9 distinct numbers for the columns, each appearing 3 times in their respective columns.But wait, the grid is 9x9, so each cell is part of a row and a column.If the row numbers and column numbers are all distinct, then each cell would have to be assigned a number that is both a row number and a column number.But if all row numbers are distinct from column numbers, then each cell would have to be assigned a number that is both a row number and a column number, which is impossible because row numbers and column numbers are distinct.Wait, that might not make sense.Wait, let me think again.Each row has a number that appears at least 3 times in that row. Let's say each row has a unique number that appears 3 times, and the other 6 cells in the row have other numbers.Similarly, each column has a unique number that appears 3 times, and the other 6 cells have other numbers.But if the row numbers and column numbers are all distinct, then in the intersection of a row and column, the cell must contain a number that is either the row's special number or the column's special number.But since the row's special number is different from the column's special number, the cell must contain one or the other.But if we have to do this for all cells, it might not be possible because each cell is in one row and one column, so it needs to be assigned either the row's special number or the column's special number.But if all row special numbers and column special numbers are distinct, then each cell must be assigned one of two distinct numbers, but we have 9 rows and 9 columns, so 18 distinct numbers.But each cell can only hold one number, so we have to choose for each cell whether to take the row's special number or the column's special number.But in doing so, we might end up with conflicts.Wait, let's try to construct such a grid.Let me denote the row special numbers as R1, R2, ..., R9, each appearing 3 times in their respective rows.Similarly, column special numbers as C1, C2, ..., C9, each appearing 3 times in their respective columns.Now, for each cell (i,j), we can assign either Ri or Cj.But since Ri and Cj are distinct for all i and j, each cell must be assigned either Ri or Cj.Now, in row i, we need Ri to appear exactly 3 times. So, in row i, we have to choose 3 columns where we assign Ri, and in the remaining 6 columns, we assign Cj for each column j.Similarly, in column j, we need Cj to appear exactly 3 times. So, in column j, we have to choose 3 rows where we assign Cj, and in the remaining 6 rows, we assign Ri for each row i.But this seems like a bipartite matching problem.We can model this as a bipartite graph where one set is the rows and the other set is the columns. Each row needs to assign its special number to 3 columns, and each column needs to assign its special number to 3 rows.So, we need to find a 3-regular bipartite graph between rows and columns, where each row is connected to 3 columns, and each column is connected to 3 rows.Is such a graph possible?Yes, because 9 rows and 9 columns, each with degree 3, the total degrees are 27 on each side, which is even, so it's possible.Therefore, it is possible to construct such a grid where each row has a special number appearing 3 times, and each column has a special number appearing 3 times, and all these special numbers are distinct.In this case, there is no number that appears at least 3 times in both a row and a column, because all the row special numbers are distinct from the column special numbers.Wait, but that's a contradiction because each cell is assigned either a row special number or a column special number, and since they are all distinct, no number appears in both a row and a column.But wait, in reality, the numbers in the grid can be anything, as long as each row has at most three different numbers and each column has at most three different numbers.But in this constructed grid, each row has exactly one special number (Ri) appearing 3 times, and the other 6 cells have column special numbers (Cj). Similarly, each column has exactly one special number (Cj) appearing 3 times, and the other 6 cells have row special numbers (Ri).Therefore, in this grid, each row has 7 different numbers: Ri and the 6 Cj's. But wait, that's a problem because each row is allowed to have at most three different numbers.Wait, hold on. If each row has Ri appearing 3 times, and the other 6 cells have Cj's, but each Cj is a different number, then the row would have 1 + 6 = 7 different numbers, which exceeds the maximum of 3 different numbers per row.Ah, that's a mistake in my construction.So, my initial idea was flawed because I assumed that each cell could be assigned either Ri or Cj, but that would result in each row having too many different numbers.Therefore, such a grid is not possible because it would violate the constraint of at most three different numbers per row and per column.So, in reality, the numbers assigned to the rows and columns cannot be entirely distinct because that would cause each row and column to have too many different numbers.Therefore, the row special numbers and column special numbers must overlap to some extent.So, in other words, some numbers must be assigned as both row special numbers and column special numbers.Therefore, in this case, there must be some number that appears at least 3 times in a row and at least 3 times in a column.So, n is at least 3.But can we get a higher n?Wait, let's think about the minimal case where each row has exactly three different numbers, each appearing 3 times, and each column also has exactly three different numbers, each appearing 3 times.In this case, n would be 3.But perhaps in some grids, you can have a number appearing more times in a row or column.But the question is about the maximum n that is guaranteed, regardless of the grid.So, even if some grids have higher n, we need the minimal n that is always true.But wait, in the previous attempt, I tried to construct a grid where row special numbers and column special numbers are distinct, but that led to too many different numbers per row and column, which is not allowed.Therefore, such a grid is impossible, meaning that the row special numbers and column special numbers must overlap.Therefore, there must be at least one number that is a row special number and a column special number, meaning it appears at least 3 times in some row and at least 3 times in some column.Therefore, n is at least 3.But can we guarantee a higher n?Wait, let's think about the total number of times numbers appear in rows and columns.Each row has 9 cells, and each row has at most three different numbers. So, the total number of cell assignments is 81.But each row contributes at least one number appearing 3 times, so across all rows, there are 9 numbers each appearing at least 3 times, contributing at least 27 cell assignments.Similarly, each column contributes at least one number appearing 3 times, so across all columns, there are 9 numbers each appearing at least 3 times, contributing at least 27 cell assignments.But the total cell assignments are 81, so 27 + 27 = 54, which is less than 81.Therefore, there is overlap in the cell assignments.But how does that help?Wait, perhaps considering that some numbers are counted both in rows and columns.Wait, maybe using double counting.Let me define S as the set of numbers that appear at least 3 times in some row, and T as the set of numbers that appear at least 3 times in some column.We need to show that S and T have a non-empty intersection, i.e., there exists a number in both S and T.But earlier, I tried to construct a grid where S and T are disjoint, but that led to too many different numbers per row and column, which is not allowed.Therefore, S and T must overlap, meaning there exists a number that appears at least 3 times in some row and at least 3 times in some column.Therefore, n is at least 3.But can we guarantee a higher n?Wait, let's think about the maximum number of times a number can appear in a row or column.If a number appears 4 times in a row, then in that row, the other 5 cells must have at most two other numbers, since the row can have at most three different numbers.Similarly, if a number appears 4 times in a column, the other 5 cells must have at most two other numbers.But does this affect the overall grid?Wait, perhaps considering that if a number appears 4 times in a row, it might also have to appear multiple times in columns.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps using the pigeonhole principle again.Suppose that in each row, the maximum number of times any number appears is 3. Then, the total number of cell assignments is 81, and if each row has three numbers each appearing 3 times, that's 9 rows * 3 numbers * 3 appearances = 81, which is exactly the total.Therefore, if every row has exactly three numbers each appearing 3 times, and every column also has exactly three numbers each appearing 3 times, then n=3 is achieved.But if some rows have numbers appearing more than 3 times, then the corresponding columns might have those numbers appearing more times as well.But the question is about the maximum n that is guaranteed, so even if some grids have higher n, we need the minimal n that is always true.Wait, but in the case where each row and column has exactly three numbers each appearing 3 times, n=3 is achieved, and it's the minimal case.Therefore, n cannot be higher than 3, because in some grids, n=3 is the maximum.Wait, but actually, in that grid, n=3 is achieved, but in other grids, n could be higher.But the question is about the maximum n that is guaranteed, so regardless of the grid, there must be a number that appears at least n times in some row and some column.So, if in some grids, n=3 is the maximum, but in others, it's higher, then the maximum n that is guaranteed is 3.Wait, but earlier, I thought that in any grid, n must be at least 3, because of the overlapping of row and column special numbers.But in the constructed grid where each row has three numbers each appearing 3 times, and each column has three numbers each appearing 3 times, n=3 is achieved.But in that grid, there are numbers that appear 3 times in rows and 3 times in columns.But in another grid, perhaps a number appears 4 times in a row and 4 times in a column.But since the question is about the maximum n that is guaranteed, regardless of the grid, the answer is 3.Wait, but I'm a bit confused now.Let me try to think of it another way.Suppose that in every row, the maximum number of times any number appears is 3. Then, in that case, n=3 is the maximum.But if in some rows, numbers appear more than 3 times, then n could be higher.But since the problem is about guaranteeing n, regardless of the grid, the answer is the minimal such n that is always true.Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the maximum n such that in any grid satisfying the conditions, there exists a number that appears at least n times in some row and some column.So, to find the maximum n, we need the minimal upper bound such that in every grid, there is a number that appears at least n times in some row and some column.Therefore, n is the minimal number such that in every grid, there exists a number with at least n appearances in some row and column.Wait, no, actually, it's the maximum n such that in every grid, there exists a number that appears at least n times in some row and some column.So, if in every grid, there is a number that appears at least 3 times in some row and some column, then n=3 is the answer.But is it possible to have a grid where no number appears more than 3 times in any row or column?Yes, as in the case where each row and column has three numbers each appearing 3 times.Therefore, in that grid, n=3 is achieved.But in other grids, n could be higher.But since the question is about the maximum n that is guaranteed, regardless of the grid, the answer is 3.Wait, but earlier, I thought that in any grid, there must be a number that appears at least 3 times in some row and some column, because of the overlapping of row and column special numbers.But in the constructed grid where each row has three numbers each appearing 3 times, and each column has three numbers each appearing 3 times, n=3 is achieved.But in that grid, there are numbers that appear 3 times in rows and 3 times in columns.Therefore, n=3 is guaranteed.But wait, in that grid, each number appears exactly 3 times in each row and column, so n=3 is achieved.But in another grid, perhaps a number appears 4 times in a row and 4 times in a column.But since the question is about the maximum n that is guaranteed, regardless of the grid, the answer is 3.Wait, but I'm still a bit confused.Let me try to think of it in terms of the pigeonhole principle.Each row has 9 cells, and at most three different numbers. So, in each row, at least one number must appear at least ceiling(9/3)=3 times.Similarly, in each column, at least one number must appear at least 3 times.Therefore, in the entire grid, there are 9 rows, each contributing at least one number that appears 3 times in that row, and 9 columns, each contributing at least one number that appears 3 times in that column.Now, the total number of such row numbers is 9, and the total number of column numbers is 9.If any of these row numbers is also a column number, then that number appears at least 3 times in some row and at least 3 times in some column.Therefore, n=3 is guaranteed.But can we have a grid where all row numbers and column numbers are distinct?As I tried earlier, but that led to too many different numbers per row and column, which is not allowed.Therefore, the row numbers and column numbers must overlap, meaning that at least one number is both a row number and a column number, hence appearing at least 3 times in a row and at least 3 times in a column.Therefore, n=3 is guaranteed.But can we guarantee a higher n?Suppose that in some grid, every number that appears 3 times in a row also appears 3 times in a column.But that doesn't necessarily mean that a number appears more than 3 times in a row or column.Wait, but perhaps considering that if a number appears 3 times in a row, it might also appear multiple times in columns.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps considering that the total number of times numbers appear in rows is 9*3=27, and similarly for columns.But the total number of cell assignments is 81, so 27+27=54, which is less than 81, so there must be overlap.Wait, but how does that help?Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of degrees in a bipartite graph.Let me model the grid as a bipartite graph where one set is the rows and the other set is the columns. Each cell is an edge between a row and a column, labeled with a number.Each row has 9 edges, and each column has 9 edges.Each row can have at most three different labels (numbers), and each column can have at most three different labels.We need to find a label that appears at least n times in some row and at least n times in some column.Wait, but I'm not sure how to proceed with this model.Alternatively, perhaps considering that each number that appears in a row must also appear in some columns.But I'm stuck.Wait, perhaps considering that if a number appears k times in a row, it must appear in k different columns.Similarly, if it appears m times in a column, it must appear in m different rows.But I'm not sure.Wait, let me think about the maximum n.Suppose that n=4.Is it possible to construct a grid where no number appears 4 times in any row or column?Yes, as in the case where each row and column has three numbers each appearing 3 times.Therefore, n=4 is not guaranteed.Therefore, the maximum n that is guaranteed is 3.Therefore, the answer is 3.**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( n ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=x^3-bx^2+4x (bin mathbb{R}) has an extremum at x=2.(Ⅰ) Find the value of b;(Ⅱ) Find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) in the interval left[ 0,4 right].","answer":"Alright, so I have this function f(x) = x³ - b x² + 4x, and I know that it has an extremum at x = 2. I need to find the value of b first, which is part (Ⅰ). Then, in part (Ⅱ), I have to find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [0, 4].Okay, starting with part (Ⅰ). I remember that extrema occur where the first derivative is zero or undefined, right? Since f(x) is a polynomial, its derivative will also be a polynomial, which is defined everywhere. So, the extremum at x = 2 means that the derivative f'(2) should be zero.Let me compute the derivative of f(x). The derivative of x³ is 3x², the derivative of -b x² is -2b x, and the derivative of 4x is 4. So, putting it all together:f'(x) = 3x² - 2b x + 4.Now, since there's an extremum at x = 2, plugging x = 2 into f'(x) should give me zero:f'(2) = 3*(2)² - 2b*(2) + 4 = 0.Let me compute that step by step. First, 3*(2)² is 3*4 = 12. Then, -2b*(2) is -4b. And the last term is +4. So, putting it all together:12 - 4b + 4 = 0.Combine the constants: 12 + 4 is 16. So, 16 - 4b = 0.Solving for b: 16 = 4b => b = 16 / 4 = 4.So, b is 4. That seems straightforward. Let me just double-check my steps.1. f(x) = x³ - b x² + 4x.2. f'(x) = 3x² - 2b x + 4.3. Plug x = 2 into f'(x): 3*(4) - 2b*(2) + 4 = 12 - 4b + 4.4. Combine constants: 16 - 4b = 0.5. Solve for b: b = 4.Yes, that seems correct.Now, moving on to part (Ⅱ). I need to find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [0, 4]. To do this, I remember that extrema can occur either at critical points within the interval or at the endpoints. So, I need to find all critical points in [0, 4] and evaluate f(x) at those points as well as at the endpoints.First, let's write down the function with the value of b we found. Since b = 4, the function becomes:f(x) = x³ - 4x² + 4x.Now, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero. We already have the derivative:f'(x) = 3x² - 8x + 4.Set this equal to zero:3x² - 8x + 4 = 0.I need to solve this quadratic equation for x. Let me use the quadratic formula:x = [8 ± sqrt(64 - 4*3*4)] / (2*3).Compute the discriminant first: 64 - 48 = 16.So, sqrt(16) is 4.Therefore, x = [8 ± 4] / 6.Calculating both solutions:First solution: (8 + 4)/6 = 12/6 = 2.Second solution: (8 - 4)/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.So, the critical points are at x = 2 and x = 2/3.Now, I need to check if these critical points lie within the interval [0, 4]. Both 2 and 2/3 are within [0, 4], so we'll include both.Therefore, the critical points are x = 2/3 and x = 2, and the endpoints are x = 0 and x = 4.Now, I need to evaluate f(x) at each of these four points: x = 0, x = 2/3, x = 2, and x = 4.Let's compute f(0):f(0) = (0)³ - 4*(0)² + 4*(0) = 0 - 0 + 0 = 0.Next, f(2/3):f(2/3) = (2/3)³ - 4*(2/3)² + 4*(2/3).Let me compute each term step by step.First term: (2/3)³ = 8/27.Second term: 4*(2/3)² = 4*(4/9) = 16/9.Third term: 4*(2/3) = 8/3.So, putting it all together:f(2/3) = 8/27 - 16/9 + 8/3.To combine these, I need a common denominator, which is 27.Convert each term:8/27 remains as is.16/9 = (16*3)/27 = 48/27.8/3 = (8*9)/27 = 72/27.So, f(2/3) = 8/27 - 48/27 + 72/27.Compute numerator: 8 - 48 + 72 = (8 + 72) - 48 = 80 - 48 = 32.So, f(2/3) = 32/27 ≈ 1.185.Wait, let me verify that calculation again because 8 - 48 is -40, then -40 +72 is 32. Yes, that's correct.So, f(2/3) = 32/27.Okay, moving on to f(2):f(2) = (2)³ - 4*(2)² + 4*(2) = 8 - 16 + 8.Compute that: 8 - 16 is -8, then -8 + 8 is 0.So, f(2) = 0.Finally, f(4):f(4) = (4)³ - 4*(4)² + 4*(4) = 64 - 64 + 16.Compute that: 64 - 64 is 0, then 0 + 16 is 16.So, f(4) = 16.Now, let me summarize the computed values:- f(0) = 0- f(2/3) ≈ 1.185 (exactly 32/27)- f(2) = 0- f(4) = 16So, comparing these values, the maximum value is 16 at x = 4, and the minimum value is 0 at both x = 0 and x = 2.Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation for f(2/3). I got 32/27, which is approximately 1.185, but is that correct?Let me recompute f(2/3):First term: (2/3)^3 = 8/27.Second term: -4*(2/3)^2 = -4*(4/9) = -16/9.Third term: 4*(2/3) = 8/3.So, f(2/3) = 8/27 - 16/9 + 8/3.Convert all to 27 denominator:8/27 - (16/9)*(3/3) = 8/27 - 48/27 + (8/3)*(9/9) = 8/27 - 48/27 + 72/27.Adding up: 8 - 48 + 72 = 32, so 32/27. Yes, that's correct.So, f(2/3) is indeed 32/27, which is approximately 1.185.So, the function reaches a local maximum at x = 2/3, which is about 1.185, and at x = 4, it's 16, which is higher. So, 16 is the absolute maximum on the interval.For the minimum, f(0) is 0, f(2) is 0, and f(2/3) is positive, so the minimum is 0.Therefore, the maximum value is 16 at x = 4, and the minimum value is 0 at x = 0 and x = 2.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that x = 2 is indeed a local minimum or maximum. Since the function has critical points at x = 2/3 and x = 2, and we know that x = 2 is an extremum because the derivative is zero there.Looking at the derivative f'(x) = 3x² - 8x + 4. Let's analyze the sign of f'(x) around x = 2.Pick a point just less than 2, say x = 1.5:f'(1.5) = 3*(2.25) - 8*(1.5) + 4 = 6.75 - 12 + 4 = -1.25. So, negative.Pick a point just more than 2, say x = 2.5:f'(2.5) = 3*(6.25) - 8*(2.5) + 4 = 18.75 - 20 + 4 = 2.75. Positive.So, the derivative goes from negative to positive at x = 2, meaning that x = 2 is a local minimum.Similarly, for x = 2/3, let's check the sign of f'(x) around 2/3.Pick x = 0.5 (which is less than 2/3 ≈ 0.6667):f'(0.5) = 3*(0.25) - 8*(0.5) + 4 = 0.75 - 4 + 4 = 0.75. Positive.Pick x = 1 (which is more than 2/3):f'(1) = 3*(1) - 8*(1) + 4 = 3 - 8 + 4 = -1. Negative.So, the derivative goes from positive to negative at x = 2/3, meaning that x = 2/3 is a local maximum.Therefore, the function has a local maximum at x = 2/3 and a local minimum at x = 2. However, when evaluating on the interval [0, 4], the absolute maximum is at x = 4, and the absolute minimum is at x = 0 and x = 2.Wait, but hold on, f(2) is 0, which is the same as f(0). So, the function starts at 0, goes up to 32/27 at x = 2/3, then back down to 0 at x = 2, and then increases again to 16 at x = 4.So, in the interval [0, 4], the maximum is 16, and the minimum is 0.Therefore, the maximum value is 16, and the minimum value is 0.I think that's all. Let me just recap:(Ⅰ) Found b by setting f'(2) = 0, which gave b = 4.(Ⅱ) Found critical points by solving f'(x) = 0, which gave x = 2/3 and x = 2. Evaluated f(x) at these points and at endpoints 0 and 4. The maximum was at x = 4, which is 16, and the minimum was at x = 0 and x = 2, which is 0.So, I think that's the solution.**Final Answer**Ⅰ.

Both (1) and (2) are correct.B. (1) is correct, (2) is incorrect.C. (1) is incorrect, (2) is correct.D. Both (1) and (2) are incorrect.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with two statements about complex numbers a, b, and c. Let me try to figure out whether each statement is correct or not.First, statement (1): If (a^{2} + b^{2} > c^{2}), then (a^{2} + b^{2} - c^{2} > 0). Hmm, this seems pretty straightforward. If the sum of (a^2) and (b^2) is greater than (c^2), then subtracting (c^2) from both sides should keep the inequality the same, right? So, (a^{2} + b^{2} - c^{2}) would indeed be greater than zero. That makes sense. So, I think statement (1) is correct.Now, moving on to statement (2): If (a^{2} + b^{2} - c^{2} > 0), then (a^{2} + b^{2} > c^{2}). Wait a minute, this seems like the converse of statement (1). So, if the difference (a^{2} + b^{2} - c^{2}) is positive, then adding (c^{2}) to both sides would give (a^{2} + b^{2} > c^{2}). That also seems correct. So, statement (2) should also be correct.But hold on, both a, b, and c are complex numbers. That might complicate things because when dealing with complex numbers, squaring them doesn't necessarily result in non-negative real numbers. In fact, (a^2), (b^2), and (c^2) can be any complex numbers, which means the inequalities might not behave the same way as they do with real numbers.Let me think about this. In the real number case, if (a), (b), and (c) are real, then (a^2), (b^2), and (c^2) are non-negative, so the inequalities make sense. But in the complex case, these squares can be negative or even complex. So, comparing them using inequalities like (>) might not be meaningful because complex numbers aren't ordered in the same way real numbers are.Wait, but the problem states (a, b, c in mathbf{C}), so they are complex numbers. However, the inequalities are written as (a^{2} + b^{2} > c^{2}) and (a^{2} + b^{2} - c^{2} > 0). So, does this mean that the expressions (a^{2} + b^{2}) and (c^{2}) are being treated as real numbers? Or is the inequality in the complex plane?I think in complex analysis, inequalities like (>) aren't typically defined because complex numbers aren't ordered. So, if (a), (b), and (c) are complex, then (a^2 + b^2) and (c^2) are also complex, and it's not clear what (a^{2} + b^{2} > c^{2}) means. It might be referring to their magnitudes, but the problem doesn't specify that.Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that (a), (b), and (c) are real numbers, even though it says they're complex. That would make the inequalities meaningful. But the question explicitly states they are complex, so I have to consider that.Wait, perhaps the problem is using the notation (>) in a different way, maybe comparing their moduli? If that's the case, then (|a^2 + b^2| > |c^2|) would imply (|a^2 + b^2| - |c^2| > 0), but that's not necessarily the same as (|a^2 + b^2 - c^2|). Because the modulus of a sum isn't the sum of moduli.So, if (a^2 + b^2) and (c^2) are complex numbers, then (a^2 + b^2 > c^2) doesn't really make sense unless we're talking about their real parts or something else. It's unclear.Alternatively, maybe the problem is treating (a), (b), and (c) as real numbers despite being in (mathbf{C}). That would make the inequalities meaningful. If that's the case, then both statements (1) and (2) are correct because they're just simple algebraic manipulations.But since the problem specifies that (a, b, c) are complex numbers, I think the inequalities are not well-defined. Because in complex numbers, you can't compare them with (>) in the same way as real numbers. So, both statements (1) and (2) are actually incorrect because the premise is not meaningful.Wait, but maybe the problem is using (>) in a different sense, like the real part. For example, if we consider the real parts of (a^2 + b^2) and (c^2), then the inequalities could make sense. But the problem doesn't specify that. So, I don't think we can assume that.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the notation in a way that (a^2 + b^2) and (c^2) are real numbers, even though (a), (b), and (c) are complex. But that would require (a), (b), and (c) to be purely imaginary or something, which isn't necessarily the case.Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is just testing the logical equivalence of the two statements, regardless of the nature of (a), (b), and (c). So, if (P) implies (Q), then (Q) implies (P) only if they are equivalent.But in this case, statement (1) is (P implies Q) and statement (2) is (Q implies P). So, if (P) and (Q) are equivalent, then both implications are correct. But if they are not equivalent, then one might be correct and the other not.But wait, in this case, (P) is (a^2 + b^2 > c^2) and (Q) is (a^2 + b^2 - c^2 > 0). So, these are actually the same statement, just written differently. So, (P) is equivalent to (Q). Therefore, both implications should hold.But again, this is only if the inequalities are meaningful. If the inequalities are not meaningful because (a), (b), and (c) are complex, then both statements are incorrect because the premises are not valid.Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that (a^2 + b^2) and (c^2) are real numbers. For example, if (a), (b), and (c) are real, then their squares are non-negative, and the inequalities make sense. But since the problem says they are complex, I think we can't assume that.Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the squares in a different way, like the magnitude squared. So, if (a), (b), and (c) are complex numbers, then (|a|^2 + |b|^2 > |c|^2) would make sense. But the problem doesn't use the modulus notation, it just uses (a^2), which for complex numbers is different from (|a|^2).So, (a^2) for a complex number (a) is not necessarily a real number. For example, if (a = i), then (a^2 = -1), which is real, but if (a = 1 + i), then (a^2 = (1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i), which is purely imaginary. So, (a^2) can be complex, making the inequality (a^2 + b^2 > c^2) not meaningful because you can't compare complex numbers with (>).Therefore, both statements (1) and (2) are incorrect because the inequalities are not well-defined for complex numbers. So, the answer should be D: Both (1) and (2) are incorrect.Wait, but let me double-check. If (a), (b), and (c) are complex, then (a^2 + b^2) and (c^2) are also complex. So, the inequality (a^2 + b^2 > c^2) is not a standard inequality because complex numbers aren't ordered. Therefore, the statements (1) and (2) are not valid because they rely on an undefined comparison.Hence, both statements are incorrect. So, the correct answer is D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"A store sold some pens on the first day. On the second day, after reducing the price of each pen by 1 yuan, it sold 100 more pens.

If the revenue from selling pens was the same on all three days, what was the price per pen on the first day in yuan?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a store selling pens over three days with different pricing and quantities, and the revenue is the same each day. I need to find the price per pen on the first day. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me parse the problem:- Day 1: Sold some pens at a certain price. Let's denote the price per pen as ( p ) yuan, and the number of pens sold as ( q ). So, revenue on day 1 is ( R = p times q ).- Day 2: The price was reduced by 1 yuan, so the new price is ( p - 1 ) yuan. They sold 100 more pens than the first day, so the quantity sold is ( q + 100 ). The revenue on day 2 is ( R = (p - 1) times (q + 100) ).- Day 3: The price was increased by 3 yuan compared to the previous day (which was day 2). So, the price on day 3 is ( (p - 1) + 3 = p + 2 ) yuan. They sold 200 fewer pens than the previous day (day 2), so the quantity sold is ( (q + 100) - 200 = q - 100 ). The revenue on day 3 is ( R = (p + 2) times (q - 100) ).Given that the revenue ( R ) is the same for all three days, so:1. ( p times q = (p - 1) times (q + 100) )2. ( p times q = (p + 2) times (q - 100) )So, I have two equations here. Let me write them out:Equation 1: ( pq = (p - 1)(q + 100) )Equation 2: ( pq = (p + 2)(q - 100) )My goal is to solve for ( p ). So, I need to find the value of ( p ) that satisfies both equations.Let me start by expanding Equation 1:( pq = (p - 1)(q + 100) )Expanding the right side:( pq = p(q + 100) - 1(q + 100) )( pq = pq + 100p - q - 100 )Now, subtract ( pq ) from both sides:( 0 = 100p - q - 100 )So, Equation 1 simplifies to:( 100p - q - 100 = 0 )Let me write this as:( 100p - q = 100 )  --- Equation 1aNow, let's do the same for Equation 2:( pq = (p + 2)(q - 100) )Expanding the right side:( pq = p(q - 100) + 2(q - 100) )( pq = pq - 100p + 2q - 200 )Subtract ( pq ) from both sides:( 0 = -100p + 2q - 200 )So, Equation 2 simplifies to:( -100p + 2q - 200 = 0 )Let me write this as:( -100p + 2q = 200 )  --- Equation 2aNow, I have two equations:1. ( 100p - q = 100 )  (Equation 1a)2. ( -100p + 2q = 200 )  (Equation 2a)I can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let me use elimination.First, let's write both equations:Equation 1a: ( 100p - q = 100 )Equation 2a: ( -100p + 2q = 200 )If I add these two equations together, the ( 100p ) and ( -100p ) will cancel out.Adding Equation 1a and Equation 2a:( (100p - q) + (-100p + 2q) = 100 + 200 )Simplify:( 0p + q = 300 )So, ( q = 300 )Now that I have ( q = 300 ), I can substitute this back into Equation 1a to find ( p ).Equation 1a: ( 100p - q = 100 )Substitute ( q = 300 ):( 100p - 300 = 100 )Add 300 to both sides:( 100p = 400 )Divide both sides by 100:( p = 4 )So, the price per pen on the first day was 4 yuan.Wait, let me verify this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Let me check the revenues for each day with ( p = 4 ) and ( q = 300 ).Day 1:Price: 4 yuan, Quantity: 300 pens.Revenue: ( 4 times 300 = 1200 ) yuan.Day 2:Price: ( 4 - 1 = 3 ) yuan, Quantity: ( 300 + 100 = 400 ) pens.Revenue: ( 3 times 400 = 1200 ) yuan.Day 3:Price: ( 3 + 3 = 6 ) yuan, Quantity: ( 400 - 200 = 200 ) pens.Revenue: ( 6 times 200 = 1200 ) yuan.Yes, all revenues are equal to 1200 yuan. So, the calculations seem correct.Therefore, the price per pen on the first day was 4 yuan.**Final Answer**The price per pen on the first day was boxed{4} yuan."},{"question":"There is an infinite one-way checkered strip, with cells numbered by natural numbers, and a bag with ten stones. Initially, there are no stones in the cells of the strip. The following actions are possible:- Move a stone from the bag to the first cell of the strip or back;- If there is a stone in the cell numbered i, you can move a stone from the bag to the cell numbered i+1 or back.Can you, following these rules, place a stone in the cell numbered 1000?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about an infinite checkered strip with cells numbered by natural numbers. There's a bag with ten stones, and initially, no stones are on the strip. The allowed actions are:1. Move a stone from the bag to the first cell or back.2. If there's a stone in cell i, you can move a stone from the bag to cell i+1 or back.The question is whether it's possible to place a stone in cell number 1000 following these rules.Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. So, we have a finite number of stones—ten in total. The strip is infinite, which is good because we need to get to 1000, but the challenge is moving stones step by step, right?First, let me understand the rules more clearly. The first action allows me to move a stone to the first cell or take it back. So, I can put a stone on cell 1 or remove it. The second action is a bit more complex: if there's a stone in cell i, I can move a stone from the bag to cell i+1 or back. Wait, does that mean I can only move a stone to i+1 if there's already a stone in i? So, it's like a stepping stone kind of thing.So, to move a stone to cell 2, I need a stone in cell 1. To move a stone to cell 3, I need a stone in cell 2, and so on. That makes sense. So, each time, to move a stone further along the strip, I need a stone in the previous cell.But here's the catch: I only have ten stones. So, if I want to get a stone all the way to 1000, I need to somehow use these ten stones to build a path or something?Wait, maybe it's similar to the concept of binary representations or something? Because each stone can kind of represent a step, but with limited stones, how do we get so far?Let me think about smaller numbers first. Let's say I want to get a stone to cell 2. How would I do that?1. Move a stone from the bag to cell 1. Now, cell 1 has one stone, and the bag has nine.2. Since there's a stone in cell 1, I can move a stone from the bag to cell 2. Now, cell 2 has one stone, and the bag has eight.Okay, so that works. Now, what about cell 3?1. Move a stone to cell 1. Bag has nine.2. Move a stone to cell 2. Bag has eight.3. Now, with a stone in cell 2, move a stone to cell 3. Bag has seven.So, each time, moving a stone one cell further requires using an additional stone. So, to get to cell n, I need n stones? Wait, but I only have ten stones. So, does that mean I can only get up to cell 10?But wait, maybe not. Because perhaps I can reuse the stones. For example, after moving a stone to cell 2, maybe I can move the stone from cell 1 back to the bag, freeing it up for another use.Let me test that idea.1. Move stone to cell 1. Bag: 92. Move stone to cell 2. Bag: 83. Now, move the stone from cell 1 back to the bag. Bag: 94. Now, with cell 2 occupied, can I move a stone to cell 3? Yes, move a stone from the bag to cell 3. Bag: 85. Now, cell 3 has a stone, cell 2 has a stone, and cell 1 is empty.Wait, but now, if I want to move a stone to cell 4, I need a stone in cell 3. So, I can move a stone from the bag to cell 4. Bag: 7But in this way, each time I move a stone further, I have to leave a stone behind in the previous cell. So, to get to cell 4, I have to have a stone in cell 3, which required a stone in cell 2, which required a stone in cell 1.So, actually, each time I move a stone further, I have to have all the previous cells occupied? No, wait, not necessarily. Because I can move stones back.Wait, let me think again. If I have a stone in cell 2, I can move a stone to cell 3. Then, if I move the stone from cell 2 back to the bag, I can use that stone again elsewhere. But then, cell 3 is still occupied, so I can move a stone to cell 4. But cell 3 is occupied, so I can move a stone to cell 4 without needing cell 2.Wait, no. The rule says if there's a stone in cell i, you can move a stone from the bag to cell i+1 or back. So, to move a stone to cell i+1, you need a stone in cell i.Therefore, to move a stone to cell 3, you need a stone in cell 2. Once you have a stone in cell 3, you can move a stone to cell 4, but you don't need cell 2 anymore, right? Because the rule only requires a stone in the immediate previous cell.So, in that case, maybe you can move the stone from cell 2 back to the bag after moving a stone to cell 3. Then, cell 2 is empty, but cell 3 is occupied. Then, you can use the stone from cell 3 to move a stone to cell 4, and so on.But wait, each time you move a stone further, you have to leave a stone in the previous cell? Or can you move it back?Wait, no. Let me clarify.If I have a stone in cell i, I can move a stone from the bag to cell i+1. So, moving a stone to cell i+1 doesn't require moving the stone from cell i, just that cell i has a stone. So, after moving a stone to cell i+1, cell i still has its stone.So, for example:1. Move stone to cell 1. Bag: 92. Move stone to cell 2. Bag: 83. Move stone to cell 3. Bag: 74. Move stone to cell 4. Bag: 6...10. Move stone to cell 10. Bag: 0Wait, so if I just keep moving stones forward, each time using one stone, I can get up to cell 10 with all ten stones. But then, I can't go further because the bag is empty.But the problem is asking to get a stone to cell 1000. So, 1000 is way beyond 10. So, how can we get beyond 10?Wait, maybe we can use some kind of binary representation or something where each stone can be used to move multiple times.Wait, another thought: if I can move stones back, maybe I can reuse them. For example, after moving a stone to cell 2, I can move it back to the bag, freeing it up. Then, use that stone to move another stone to cell 2 again, but maybe that's not helpful.Wait, let me think in terms of how many stones are needed to reach a certain cell.Suppose I want to get a stone to cell n. How many stones do I need?Well, to get a stone to cell 1, I need 1 stone.To get a stone to cell 2, I need to have a stone in cell 1, then move another stone to cell 2. So, total 2 stones.Similarly, to get a stone to cell 3, I need a stone in cell 2, which requires a stone in cell 1. So, total 3 stones.Wait, so in general, to get a stone to cell n, you need n stones? But that would mean to get to 1000, we need 1000 stones, but we only have 10. So, that can't be.But that seems contradictory because the problem is asking if it's possible with 10 stones. So, maybe my initial reasoning is wrong.Wait, perhaps the key is that you can move stones back, so you don't need to have all the previous cells occupied. Instead, you can use the stones in a more efficient way.Let me think of it as a binary counter or something. Each stone can represent a bit, and moving it forward is like incrementing the counter.Wait, actually, this might be similar to the concept of a binary counter where each bit represents a power of two. So, with 10 stones, you can represent numbers up to 2^10 - 1, which is 1023. So, 1000 is within that range.But how does that translate to moving stones?Wait, maybe each stone can be used to represent a certain position, and by moving them in a certain way, you can reach higher numbers.Wait, another angle: think of each stone as a pointer. If you have multiple stones, you can use them to move other stones further ahead.Wait, for example, if you have two stones, you can move one to cell 1, then use that to move another to cell 2, then move the first stone back, and use it again to move the second stone to cell 3, and so on.Wait, that might work.Let me try to formalize this.Suppose I have two stones. I can move one to cell 1, then use that to move the second stone to cell 2. Then, move the first stone back to the bag, and use it to move the second stone to cell 3. Then, move the first stone to cell 1 again, use it to move the second stone to cell 4, and so on.Wait, but in this case, each time I move the second stone further, I have to move the first stone back and forth. So, effectively, with two stones, I can move one stone as far as I want, but it takes multiple steps.But how does this scale with more stones?Wait, maybe with more stones, you can move them in a way that each stone helps move the next one further, kind of like a relay.Wait, this is starting to sound like the concept of a binary counter, where each stone represents a bit, and moving them forward is like incrementing the counter.In a binary counter, each bit can be either 0 or 1, and to increment, you flip the least significant bit, and if it was 1, you carry over to the next bit.Similarly, maybe each stone can represent a bit, and moving it forward is like setting that bit. Then, with 10 stones, you can represent numbers up to 2^10 - 1, which is 1023. So, 1000 is within that range.But how does that translate to moving stones on the strip?Wait, perhaps each stone corresponds to a power of two, and by moving them in a certain order, you can reach any number up to 1023.Wait, let me think of the stones as representing binary digits. Each stone can be in the bag (0) or on the strip (1). The position of the stone on the strip corresponds to a certain power of two.But in this problem, the stones are on a linear strip, not in separate positions. So, maybe each stone's position can represent a bit.Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, think of each stone as a counter that can be incremented, and the position represents the value.Wait, this is getting a bit abstract. Let me try a different approach.Suppose I have k stones. What's the maximum distance I can reach?If I use each stone to help move the next one, similar to how in computing you can use registers to move data, the maximum distance would be something like 2^k - 1.Wait, that rings a bell. In problems where you have to move something with limited resources, the maximum distance is often exponential in the number of resources.So, with k stones, you can reach up to 2^k - 1.In this case, k is 10, so 2^10 - 1 is 1023. So, 1000 is less than 1023, so it should be possible.But how exactly?Wait, let's think recursively.Suppose with 1 stone, you can reach cell 1.With 2 stones, you can reach cell 3.Wait, how?1. Move stone 1 to cell 1.2. Move stone 2 to cell 2 using stone 1.3. Move stone 1 back to the bag.4. Move stone 1 to cell 1 again.5. Move stone 2 to cell 3 using stone 1.Wait, so with two stones, you can get to cell 3.Similarly, with three stones, you can get to cell 7.Wait, 2^3 - 1 = 7.So, the pattern is that with n stones, you can reach cell 2^n - 1.Therefore, with 10 stones, you can reach cell 2^10 - 1 = 1023.Since 1000 is less than 1023, it's possible.But how exactly does this work? Let me try to outline the steps for a smaller number to see the pattern.Let's say with 3 stones, how do we get to cell 7.1. Move stone 1 to cell 1.2. Move stone 2 to cell 2 using stone 1.3. Move stone 3 to cell 3 using stone 2.4. Now, move stone 2 back to the bag.5. Move stone 2 to cell 2 using stone 1.6. Move stone 3 to cell 4 using stone 2.7. Move stone 2 back to the bag.8. Move stone 2 to cell 2 using stone 1.9. Move stone 3 to cell 5 using stone 2.10. Continue this process, each time moving stone 3 further by moving stone 2 back and forth.Wait, this seems tedious, but the idea is that each time you want to move stone 3 further, you have to move stone 2 back to cell 2, which requires moving stone 1 back and forth as well.But in the end, with 3 stones, you can get to cell 7.Similarly, with 4 stones, you can get to cell 15, and so on.So, in general, with n stones, you can reach cell 2^n - 1.Therefore, with 10 stones, you can reach cell 1023, which is more than 1000.So, the answer should be yes, it's possible.But let me try to think of the exact steps to get to 1000.Well, 1000 in binary is 1111101000, which is 10 bits. So, with 10 stones, each representing a bit, we can set the bits accordingly to reach 1000.But how does that translate to moving stones?Wait, maybe each stone corresponds to a bit, and moving it to a certain cell represents setting that bit. Then, by moving stones to specific cells, we can represent the binary digits of 1000.But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.Alternatively, maybe it's similar to the binary counter idea, where each stone represents a bit, and moving it forward is like incrementing the counter.Wait, perhaps the key is that each stone can be used to move another stone further, effectively doubling the distance each time.So, with each additional stone, you can double the maximum distance.So, with 1 stone, max distance 1.With 2 stones, max distance 3 (1 + 2).With 3 stones, max distance 7 (1 + 2 + 4).With 4 stones, max distance 15 (1 + 2 + 4 + 8).And so on, up to 10 stones, which would give 2^10 - 1 = 1023.So, 1000 is within that range.Therefore, it's possible.But to actually perform the steps, it would be a long process, but theoretically, it's possible.So, the answer is yes, we can place a stone in cell 1000.**Final Answer**boxed{1000}"},{"question":"An amoeba is placed in a puddle one day, and on that same day it splits into two amoebas.

Starting with one amoeba on day one, it splits into two on day two, and so on.To find the total number after one week, which is seven days, I can use the formula for exponential growth: 2 raised to the power of the number of days minus one. This is because the initial amoeba is counted as day one without any splits yet.Calculating 2 to the power of 6 (since 7 days minus one day equals 6 splits) gives me 64.

The question says it's a quadratic equation in terms of x, and I need to find the value of m. Hmm, let me think about what makes an equation quadratic.A quadratic equation is of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, right? So the highest power of x should be 2. That means in this equation, the exponent of x, which is |m|, should be equal to 2. So, |m| = 2. That gives me two possibilities for m: m = 2 or m = -2.But wait, I also need to make sure that the coefficient of x² isn't zero because if it is, then it wouldn't be a quadratic equation anymore—it would be linear or something else. The coefficient here is (m - 2). So, (m - 2) shouldn't be zero. That means m ≠ 2.So, from the two possible values of m, which are 2 and -2, m can't be 2 because that would make the coefficient zero. Therefore, the only possible value is m = -2.Let me double-check that. If m = -2, then the equation becomes (-2 - 2)x^{|-2|} - b x - 1 = 0, which simplifies to (-4)x² - b x - 1 = 0. That is indeed a quadratic equation because the highest power of x is 2, and the coefficient of x² is -4, which isn't zero. So, that works.If I had chosen m = 2, the equation would become (2 - 2)x^{|2|} - b x - 1 = 0, which simplifies to 0x² - b x - 1 = 0, or just -b x - 1 = 0.

The points O and A are given as O(0,0) and A(1,1). Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, let me plot these points and the line. Point O is the origin, and point A is at (1,1). The line l is x - y + 1 = 0. Let me rewrite that equation in slope-intercept form to make it easier to graph. So, x - y + 1 = 0 can be rearranged to y = x + 1. That's a straight line with a slope of 1 and y-intercept at (0,1). So, it's a diagonal line going up to the right.Now, point P is somewhere on this line l. I need to find the position of P such that the sum of the distances from P to A and from P to O is minimized. That is, minimize |PA| + |PO|.Hmm, this seems like a problem where I can use reflection. I remember that in optimization problems involving distances, reflecting a point across a line can help find the shortest path. Let me recall how that works.If I have a point and a line, reflecting the point across the line gives a mirror image. Then, the shortest path from the original point to another point via a point on the line is the straight line distance between the original point and the reflection, intersecting the line at the optimal point P.So, in this case, I need to reflect either point O or point A across the line l and then find the distance between the reflected point and the other original point. The intersection of this line with l will give me the point P that minimizes the sum |PA| + |PO|.Let me choose to reflect point O across line l. So, I need to find the reflection of O(0,0) over the line l: y = x + 1.To find the reflection of a point over a line, I can use the formula for reflection over a line ax + by + c = 0. The formula is:If the line is ax + by + c = 0, then the reflection of point (x0, y0) is:(x', y') = (x0 - 2a(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²), y0 - 2b(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²))Wait, let me make sure I have that right. I think it's:x' = x0 - 2a(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²)y' = y0 - 2b(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²)Yes, that seems correct.So, first, let me write the line l in standard form. It's x - y + 1 = 0, so a = 1, b = -1, c = 1.Point O is (0,0). Let's compute ax0 + by0 + c:ax0 + by0 + c = (1)(0) + (-1)(0) + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.Now, compute the denominator a² + b² = 1² + (-1)² = 1 + 1 = 2.So, the reflection point O' will be:x' = 0 - 2*1*(1)/2 = 0 - 2*(1)/2 = 0 - 1 = -1y' = 0 - 2*(-1)*(1)/2 = 0 - (-2)/2 = 0 + 1 = 1So, the reflection of O over line l is O'(-1, 1).Wait, let me verify that. If I reflect (0,0) over y = x + 1, the reflected point should be (-1,1). Let me check if the midpoint between O and O' lies on line l.Midpoint M is ((0 + (-1))/2, (0 + 1)/2) = (-0.5, 0.5). Let's plug into line l: x - y + 1 = (-0.5) - (0.5) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0. Yes, that's correct. So, O' is indeed (-1,1).Alright, so now I have the reflection point O'(-1,1). Now, the idea is that the minimal path from O to P to A is the same as the straight line distance from O' to A, intersecting line l at point P.So, if I find the distance between O'(-1,1) and A(1,1), that should give me the minimal value of |PA| + |PO|.Wait, let me think about that again. Since P is on line l, and O' is the reflection of O over l, then |PO| = |PO'| because reflection preserves distance. So, |PA| + |PO| = |PA| + |PO'|. So, to minimize |PA| + |PO'|, the minimal path is the straight line from A to O', intersecting l at P.Therefore, the minimal value of |PA| + |PO| is equal to the distance between A and O'.So, let me compute the distance between A(1,1) and O'(-1,1). Since both points have the same y-coordinate, the distance is just the difference in x-coordinates.Distance = |1 - (-1)| = |2| = 2.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.Point A is (1,1), O' is (-1,1). The line connecting them is horizontal, y=1. The intersection point P of this line with line l: y = x + 1.So, set y = 1 in line l: 1 = x + 1 => x = 0. So, point P is (0,1).Wait, so P is (0,1). Let me compute |PA| + |PO|.|PA| is the distance from (0,1) to (1,1): sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (1-1)^2] = sqrt[1 + 0] = 1.|PO| is the distance from (0,1) to (0,0): sqrt[(0-0)^2 + (1-0)^2] = sqrt[0 + 1] = 1.So, |PA| + |PO| = 1 + 1 = 2. That matches the distance between A and O'.Therefore, the minimal value is 2.Wait, but just to make sure, let me try another approach to verify.Alternatively, I can parametrize point P on line l and express |PA| + |PO| as a function, then find its minimum.Line l is y = x + 1. So, any point P on l can be written as (t, t + 1), where t is a real number.Then, |PA| is the distance from (t, t + 1) to (1,1):|PA| = sqrt[(t - 1)^2 + (t + 1 - 1)^2] = sqrt[(t - 1)^2 + t^2]Similarly, |PO| is the distance from (t, t + 1) to (0,0):|PO| = sqrt[t^2 + (t + 1)^2]So, the function to minimize is f(t) = sqrt[(t - 1)^2 + t^2] + sqrt[t^2 + (t + 1)^2]Let me compute f(t):First, expand the terms inside the square roots.For |PA|: (t - 1)^2 + t^2 = t² - 2t + 1 + t² = 2t² - 2t + 1For |PO|: t² + (t + 1)^2 = t² + t² + 2t + 1 = 2t² + 2t + 1So, f(t) = sqrt(2t² - 2t + 1) + sqrt(2t² + 2t + 1)Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find its minimum by taking the derivative.Let me denote:f(t) = sqrt(2t² - 2t + 1) + sqrt(2t² + 2t + 1)Let me compute the derivative f’(t):f’(t) = [ (4t - 2) / (2 sqrt(2t² - 2t + 1)) ) ] + [ (4t + 2) / (2 sqrt(2t² + 2t + 1)) ) ]Simplify:f’(t) = (2t - 1)/sqrt(2t² - 2t + 1) + (2t + 1)/sqrt(2t² + 2t + 1)To find the critical points, set f’(t) = 0:(2t - 1)/sqrt(2t² - 2t + 1) + (2t + 1)/sqrt(2t² + 2t + 1) = 0Let me denote:Let’s set u = 2t - 1 and v = 2t + 1.But maybe another approach. Let me move one term to the other side:(2t - 1)/sqrt(2t² - 2t + 1) = - (2t + 1)/sqrt(2t² + 2t + 1)Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:[(2t - 1)^2] / (2t² - 2t + 1) = [(2t + 1)^2] / (2t² + 2t + 1)Compute numerators and denominators:Left side numerator: (4t² - 4t + 1)Left side denominator: (2t² - 2t + 1)Right side numerator: (4t² + 4t + 1)Right side denominator: (2t² + 2t + 1)So,(4t² - 4t + 1)/(2t² - 2t + 1) = (4t² + 4t + 1)/(2t² + 2t + 1)Cross-multiplying:(4t² - 4t + 1)(2t² + 2t + 1) = (4t² + 4t + 1)(2t² - 2t + 1)Let me compute both sides.First, left side:(4t² - 4t + 1)(2t² + 2t + 1)Multiply term by term:4t²*(2t²) = 8t⁴4t²*(2t) = 8t³4t²*(1) = 4t²-4t*(2t²) = -8t³-4t*(2t) = -8t²-4t*(1) = -4t1*(2t²) = 2t²1*(2t) = 2t1*(1) = 1Now, add all these terms:8t⁴ + 8t³ + 4t² -8t³ -8t² -4t + 2t² + 2t + 1Combine like terms:8t⁴8t³ -8t³ = 04t² -8t² + 2t² = (-2t²)-4t + 2t = (-2t)+1So, left side simplifies to 8t⁴ - 2t² - 2t + 1Now, right side:(4t² + 4t + 1)(2t² - 2t + 1)Multiply term by term:4t²*(2t²) = 8t⁴4t²*(-2t) = -8t³4t²*(1) = 4t²4t*(2t²) = 8t³4t*(-2t) = -8t²4t*(1) = 4t1*(2t²) = 2t²1*(-2t) = -2t1*(1) = 1Now, add all these terms:8t⁴ -8t³ + 4t² +8t³ -8t² +4t +2t² -2t +1Combine like terms:8t⁴-8t³ +8t³ = 04t² -8t² +2t² = (-2t²)4t -2t = 2t+1So, right side simplifies to 8t⁴ - 2t² + 2t + 1Now, set left side equal to right side:8t⁴ - 2t² - 2t + 1 = 8t⁴ - 2t² + 2t + 1Subtract 8t⁴ - 2t² + 1 from both sides:-2t = 2tWhich simplifies to:-2t - 2t = 0 => -4t = 0 => t = 0So, the critical point is at t = 0.Now, let's check if this is a minimum.Compute the second derivative or test intervals around t=0.But since we have only one critical point, and the function f(t) tends to infinity as t approaches infinity or negative infinity, it's likely that t=0 is the point of minimum.So, at t=0, point P is (0, 0 + 1) = (0,1), which matches our earlier result.Therefore, the minimal value is |PA| + |PO| = 1 + 1 = 2.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute f(t) at t=0 and see.f(0) = sqrt(2*0² - 2*0 +1) + sqrt(2*0² + 2*0 +1) = sqrt(1) + sqrt(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.If I take another point, say t=1, then P is (1,2). Compute |PA| + |PO|:|PA| = distance from (1,2) to (1,1) = 1|PO| = distance from (1,2) to (0,0) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236So, total is 1 + 2.236 ≈ 3.236, which is greater than 2.Another point, t=-1, P=(-1,0). |PA| = distance from (-1,0) to (1,1) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236|PO| = distance from (-1,0) to (0,0) = 1Total ≈ 2.236 + 1 ≈ 3.236, again greater than 2.So, seems like t=0 gives the minimal value.Alternatively, if I take t=0.5, P=(0.5, 1.5)|PA| = sqrt( (0.5 -1)^2 + (1.5 -1)^2 ) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707|PO| = sqrt(0.5² + 1.5²) = sqrt(0.25 + 2.25) = sqrt(2.5) ≈ 1.581Total ≈ 0.707 + 1.581 ≈ 2.288, which is still greater than 2.So, yes, t=0 gives the minimal value of 2.Therefore, the minimal value of |PA| + |PO| is 2.**Final Answer**The minimum value of |PA| + |PO| is boxed{2}."},{"question":"In 1968, a high school graduate returned from a written university exam and shared at home that he could not solve the following problem:Several identical books and identical albums were purchased. 10 rubles and 56 kopecks were paid for the books, and 56 kopecks for the albums. The number of books bought was 6 more than the number of albums. How many books were bought if the price of a book is more than a ruble higher than the price of an album?How did his younger brother, a fifth-grader, solve the problem and conclude that 8 books were bought?If you find solving this problem challenging, try to understand and remember the conditions clearly. Seek new approaches to solving the problem. Try to \\"guess\\" the answer or approximate it. How many solutions does the problem have? Write down the solution and verify your answer.","answer":"Alright, so I came across this problem from 1968, and it's about buying books and albums. Let me try to understand it step by step. First, the problem says that several identical books and identical albums were purchased. The total amount paid for the books was 10 rubles and 56 kopecks, and for the albums, it was 56 kopecks. The number of books bought was 6 more than the number of albums. Also, the price of a book is more than a ruble higher than the price of an album. We need to find out how many books were bought, and the answer is supposed to be 8, as per the younger brother's solution. Okay, let me break this down. I need to find the number of books bought, which is 6 more than the number of albums. Let me denote the number of albums as 'a', so the number of books would be 'a + 6'. Next, the cost. The total cost for books is 10 rubles and 56 kopecks. I remember that in the old Russian currency, 1 ruble equals 100 kopecks. So, 10 rubles and 56 kopecks would be 10*100 + 56 = 1056 kopecks. Similarly, the cost for albums is 56 kopecks. So, if I denote the price of one book as 'b' kopecks and the price of one album as 'k' kopecks, then the total cost equations would be:For books: (a + 6) * b = 1056 kopecks  For albums: a * k = 56 kopecks  Also, it's given that the price of a book is more than a ruble higher than the price of an album. Since 1 ruble is 100 kopecks, this translates to b > k + 100.Alright, so now I have two equations:1. (a + 6) * b = 1056  2. a * k = 56  And the inequality:  3. b > k + 100I need to find the integer values of 'a' and 'b' that satisfy these conditions. Since both 'a' and 'b' must be integers (you can't buy a fraction of a book or album), I can approach this by looking for factors of 1056 and 56.Let me start with the second equation: a * k = 56. So, 'a' must be a divisor of 56. Let me list the positive integer divisors of 56:1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.So, possible values for 'a' are these numbers. Then, 'k' would be 56 divided by 'a'. Similarly, for the first equation: (a + 6) * b = 1056. So, (a + 6) must be a divisor of 1056. Let me list the positive integer divisors of 1056. Hmm, 1056 is a larger number, so let me factorize it:1056 ÷ 2 = 528  528 ÷ 2 = 264  264 ÷ 2 = 132  132 ÷ 2 = 66  66 ÷ 2 = 33  33 ÷ 3 = 11  11 is prime.So, the prime factorization of 1056 is 2^5 * 3 * 11. Therefore, the number of divisors is (5+1)*(1+1)*(1+1) = 6*2*2 = 24. So, there are 24 divisors. Listing them all might take time, but maybe I can find them in pairs:1 and 1056  2 and 528  3 and 352  4 and 264  6 and 176  8 and 132  11 and 96  12 and 88  16 and 66  22 and 48  24 and 44  32 and 33  So, these are the pairs of divisors. Therefore, (a + 6) must be one of these divisors, and 'b' would be the corresponding co-divisor.Now, since 'a' is a divisor of 56, let's list possible 'a' and then compute (a + 6) and see if it's a divisor of 1056.Let me go through each possible 'a' from the list of divisors of 56:1. a = 1  Then, a + 6 = 7  Is 7 a divisor of 1056? Yes, because 1056 ÷ 7 = 150.857... Wait, that's not an integer. Wait, 7 * 150 = 1050, 7*151=1057. So, 7 doesn't divide 1056 exactly. Hmm, so a=1 is not possible.Wait, hold on, 1056 ÷ 7 is 150.857, which is not integer. So, 7 is not a divisor of 1056? Wait, but 7 is a prime factor of 1056? Wait, no, earlier factorization was 2^5 * 3 * 11. So, 7 is not a factor. So, 7 doesn't divide 1056. So, a=1 is invalid.2. a = 2  a + 6 = 8  Is 8 a divisor of 1056? Yes, because 1056 ÷ 8 = 132. So, b = 132.  Then, k = 56 ÷ a = 56 ÷ 2 = 28.  Check the inequality: b > k + 100  132 > 28 + 100 => 132 > 128, which is true.  So, this is a possible solution: a=2, b=132, k=28.  Number of books is a + 6 = 8.  So, that's the answer the brother found. But let's check other possibilities to see if there are more solutions.3. a = 4  a + 6 = 10  Is 10 a divisor of 1056? 1056 ÷ 10 = 105.6, which is not integer. So, no.4. a = 7  a + 6 = 13  Is 13 a divisor of 1056? 1056 ÷ 13 ≈ 81.23, not integer. So, no.5. a = 8  a + 6 = 14  Is 14 a divisor of 1056? 1056 ÷ 14 = 75.428..., not integer. So, no.6. a = 14  a + 6 = 20  Is 20 a divisor of 1056? 1056 ÷ 20 = 52.8, not integer. So, no.7. a = 28  a + 6 = 34  Is 34 a divisor of 1056? 1056 ÷ 34 ≈ 31.058, not integer. So, no.8. a = 56  a + 6 = 62  Is 62 a divisor of 1056? 1056 ÷ 62 ≈ 17.032, not integer. So, no.So, the only possible value is a=2, leading to 8 books. Wait, but let me double-check. When a=2, the number of albums is 2, so the number of books is 8. The cost per album is 56 ÷ 2 = 28 kopecks. The cost per book is 1056 ÷ 8 = 132 kopecks. Now, checking the inequality: 132 > 28 + 100? 132 > 128, yes. So, that's correct.Is there another possible 'a'? Let me see, when a=1, a+6=7, which isn't a divisor. a=2 works. a=4, a+6=10, not a divisor. a=7, a+6=13, not a divisor. a=8, a+6=14, not a divisor. a=14, a+6=20, not a divisor. a=28, a+6=34, not a divisor. a=56, a+6=62, not a divisor. So, only a=2 works.Therefore, the number of books bought is 8.But wait, the problem says \\"the price of a book is more than a ruble higher than the price of an album.\\" So, 132 kopecks is 1 ruble and 32 kopecks, and the album is 28 kopecks. So, the difference is 104 kopecks, which is 1 ruble and 4 kopecks. So, more than a ruble higher, which is correct.Therefore, the only solution is 8 books. So, the brother must have figured this out by checking the possible divisors and found that only a=2 works, leading to 8 books.I think that's how he solved it. Maybe he listed the possible numbers of albums, calculated the corresponding number of books, checked if the total cost divides evenly, and then verified the price difference condition. Since only one solution fits all the conditions, he concluded that 8 books were bought.**Final Answer**The number of books bought is boxed{8}."},{"question":"Calculate:<br/>(1)left(-2right){}^{2}-(3-pi)^{0}+(frac{1}{3})^{-1};<br/>(2)aleft(a+2right)-left(a-1right)left(a+3).","answer":"To solve the first expression, I'll start by evaluating each term separately. The term ((-2)^2) is calculated by squaring -2, which gives 4. Next, the term ((3 - pi)^0) is equal to 1 because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Then, the term (left(frac{1}{3}right)^{-1}) is the reciprocal of (frac{1}{3}), which is 3. Adding these results together: 4 minus 1 plus 3 equals 6.For the second expression, I'll begin by expanding each part. First, (a(a + 2)) expands to (a^2 + 2a). Next, I'll expand ((a - 1)(a + 3)) using the distributive property, which results in (a^2 + 3a - a - 3), simplifying to (a^2 + 2a - 3). Subtracting the second expanded expression from the first gives (a^2 + 2a - (a^2 + 2a - 3)).

On one of the obtained pieces, two cuts were made parallel to the two shorter sides, at the midpoints of those sides. In the end, a rectangle with a perimeter of 129 mathrm{~cm} remained. The given drawing indicates the sequence of cuts.What was the perimeter of the original sheet before the cut?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular piece of cardboard that was cut along its diagonal. Then, on one of the pieces, two more cuts were made parallel to the two shorter sides, at their midpoints. After all these cuts, a smaller rectangle remained with a perimeter of 129 cm. I need to find the perimeter of the original sheet before any cuts were made.Hmm, let me try to visualize this. First, there's a rectangle. Let me denote the length and width of the original rectangle as L and W, respectively. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so the perimeter would be 2(L + W). But I don't know L or W yet.The first cut is along the diagonal. So, cutting along the diagonal would divide the rectangle into two congruent right-angled triangles. Each triangle would have sides of length L, W, and the hypotenuse, which is the diagonal. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: sqrt(L² + W²). But I don't think I need that right now.Now, on one of these triangular pieces, two more cuts are made. The cuts are parallel to the two shorter sides, and they're made at the midpoints of those sides. Hmm, okay. So, if the original rectangle had sides L and W, and assuming L is the longer side and W is the shorter side, then the triangle would have sides L, W, and the diagonal.Wait, but in the triangle, the two legs are L and W, right? So, the shorter sides of the triangle would be W and the other leg, which is L. Wait, no, actually, in the triangle, the sides are L, W, and the diagonal. So, if we consider the triangle, the two legs are L and W. So, the shorter sides of the triangle would be the shorter leg, which is W if L > W.So, the two shorter sides of the triangle are W and the other leg, which is L. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If the original rectangle has sides L and W, then the triangle has legs L and W. So, if L > W, then the shorter side is W, and the longer side is L.So, the two shorter sides of the triangle are both W? Wait, no, each triangle has one side of length L and one side of length W. So, if L > W, then the shorter side is W, and the longer side is L. So, the two shorter sides of the triangle are W and the other leg, which is L? Wait, no, each triangle only has two sides: L and W. So, the two sides of the triangle are L and W, with L being longer than W.So, when they say two cuts were made parallel to the two shorter sides at their midpoints, does that mean they made a cut parallel to W at the midpoint of L, and a cut parallel to L at the midpoint of W? Or is it parallel to the sides of the triangle?Wait, the problem says: \\"two cuts were made parallel to the two shorter sides, at the midpoints of those sides.\\" So, the two shorter sides of the original rectangle are W. So, the two shorter sides of the triangle are also W. So, the two cuts are made parallel to the shorter sides (W) at the midpoints of those sides.Wait, but in the triangle, the sides are L and W. So, the midpoints of the shorter sides would be the midpoints of the sides of length W. So, each of those midpoints is at W/2 from the vertex.So, if I make a cut parallel to the shorter side (which is W) at the midpoint of the longer side (which is L), that would be a line parallel to W, cutting the triangle into a smaller triangle and a trapezoid. Similarly, making a cut parallel to the longer side (L) at the midpoint of the shorter side (W) would create another smaller figure.Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram mentally. Let me think: the original rectangle is cut along the diagonal, so we have two right triangles. Let's focus on one triangle. The triangle has legs L and W, with L > W.Now, on this triangle, two cuts are made. The first cut is parallel to the shorter side (W) at the midpoint of the longer side (L). So, the midpoint of L is at L/2. So, cutting parallel to W at L/2 would create a smaller triangle on top and a trapezoid at the bottom.Similarly, the second cut is parallel to the longer side (L) at the midpoint of the shorter side (W). The midpoint of W is at W/2. So, cutting parallel to L at W/2 would create a smaller triangle on the side and a trapezoid.Wait, but the problem says that after these two cuts, a rectangle remains. So, perhaps the two cuts intersect, forming a rectangle inside the original triangle.Let me think. If I make a cut parallel to W at L/2, that would be a horizontal cut (assuming W is vertical) at half the length. Similarly, a cut parallel to L at W/2 would be a vertical cut at half the width. The intersection of these two cuts would form a smaller rectangle inside the triangle.But wait, in a right triangle, if you make a horizontal cut at L/2 and a vertical cut at W/2, the intersection would actually form a smaller right triangle, not a rectangle. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the cuts.Wait, perhaps the cuts are made on the original triangle, but not necessarily starting from the right angle. Let me clarify.The original triangle has legs L and W. The two cuts are made parallel to the two shorter sides. Since the triangle has two sides: one of length L and one of length W. If L > W, then the shorter sides are both W? Wait, no, each triangle has sides L, W, and the hypotenuse. So, the two legs are L and W, with L being longer.So, the two shorter sides of the triangle are both W? No, each triangle has one side of length L and one side of length W. So, the shorter side is W, and the longer side is L.Therefore, the two shorter sides of the triangle are both W? Wait, no, each triangle only has two legs: one is L, one is W. So, if L > W, then the shorter side is W, and the longer side is L.So, the two shorter sides of the triangle are both W? No, each triangle has only one side of length W. So, the two shorter sides of the triangle would be W and the other leg, which is L. Wait, that can't be because L is longer.I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.Original rectangle: length L, width W, with L > W.Cut along the diagonal, so we have two right triangles, each with legs L and W.On one of these triangles, two cuts are made: parallel to the two shorter sides, at the midpoints of those sides.So, the two shorter sides of the triangle are W and... wait, no, the triangle has sides L, W, and hypotenuse. So, the shorter sides are W and the other leg is L, which is longer. So, the two shorter sides of the triangle are W and... no, only one side is W, the other is L.Wait, maybe the two shorter sides refer to the two legs, regardless of their lengths. So, if L > W, then the shorter side is W, and the longer side is L.So, the two cuts are made parallel to the two shorter sides, which are W and... Wait, no, each triangle has two legs: one is L, one is W. So, if L > W, then the shorter leg is W, and the longer leg is L.So, the two shorter sides of the triangle are W and... there's only one shorter side, which is W. So, maybe the problem is referring to the two shorter sides of the original rectangle, which are both W.Wait, the problem says: \\"two cuts were made parallel to the two shorter sides, at the midpoints of those sides.\\" So, the two shorter sides of the original rectangle are both W. So, the cuts are made parallel to W, at the midpoints of those sides.But in the triangle, the sides are L, W, and hypotenuse. So, the midpoints of the shorter sides (which are W) would be at W/2.Wait, but in the triangle, the sides of length W are the legs. So, the midpoints of the sides of length W would be at W/2 from the vertex.So, making a cut parallel to W (which is a vertical side) at the midpoint of W would be a horizontal line cutting the triangle at W/2. Similarly, making a cut parallel to L (the longer side) at the midpoint of L would be a vertical line cutting the triangle at L/2.Wait, but the problem says \\"two cuts were made parallel to the two shorter sides, at the midpoints of those sides.\\" So, the two shorter sides are both W, so the midpoints are at W/2 on each of those sides.But in the triangle, each side of length W is a leg. So, cutting parallel to W (which is a vertical side) at the midpoint of W would be a horizontal cut at W/2. Similarly, cutting parallel to the other shorter side, which is also W, but wait, both shorter sides are W. So, maybe both cuts are parallel to W, but at midpoints of different sides.Wait, maybe I need to think differently. The original rectangle has two shorter sides of length W. After cutting along the diagonal, each triangle has one side of length W. So, the midpoints of those sides are at W/2. So, cutting parallel to W at W/2 would create a smaller triangle and a trapezoid.But the problem says two cuts were made, parallel to the two shorter sides, at the midpoints of those sides. So, perhaps one cut is parallel to W at the midpoint of W, and another cut is parallel to L at the midpoint of L.Wait, but the two shorter sides are both W, so the midpoints are on the sides of length W. So, cutting parallel to W at the midpoint of W would be a horizontal cut at W/2. Similarly, cutting parallel to L (the longer side) at the midpoint of L would be a vertical cut at L/2.But in the triangle, the side of length L is the other leg. So, the midpoint of L is at L/2. So, cutting parallel to L (which is a horizontal side in the rectangle, but in the triangle, it's a leg) at L/2 would be a vertical cut at L/2.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should assign coordinates to the triangle to better visualize.Let me place the right triangle with the right angle at the origin (0,0), the horizontal leg along the x-axis from (0,0) to (L,0), and the vertical leg along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,W). The hypotenuse is then from (L,0) to (0,W).Now, the two shorter sides of the original rectangle are both W, so the midpoints of those sides are at (0, W/2) and (L, W/2). Wait, no, in the rectangle, the shorter sides are the vertical sides of length W, so their midpoints are at (L/2, W/2) for the top side and (L/2, 0) for the bottom side? Wait, no, in the rectangle, the shorter sides are the vertical sides, each of length W. So, their midpoints are at (L/2, W/2) for the top side and (L/2, 0) for the bottom side? Wait, no, in the rectangle, each vertical side is from (0,0) to (0,W) and from (L,0) to (L,W). So, their midpoints are at (0, W/2) and (L, W/2).But in the triangle, we only have one vertical side from (0,0) to (0,W). So, the midpoint of that side is at (0, W/2). Similarly, the midpoint of the horizontal side from (0,0) to (L,0) is at (L/2, 0).Wait, but the problem says \\"two cuts were made parallel to the two shorter sides, at the midpoints of those sides.\\" So, the two shorter sides are the vertical sides of length W in the original rectangle. So, their midpoints are at (0, W/2) and (L, W/2). But in the triangle, we only have one vertical side, from (0,0) to (0,W). So, the midpoint is at (0, W/2). Similarly, the midpoint of the horizontal side is at (L/2, 0).Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think step by step.1. Original rectangle: length L, width W, L > W.2. Cut along the diagonal, resulting in two right triangles. Each triangle has legs L and W.3. On one triangle, make two cuts:   a. Parallel to the shorter side (W) at the midpoint of that side.   b. Parallel to the longer side (L) at the midpoint of that side.Wait, but the problem says \\"parallel to the two shorter sides, at the midpoints of those sides.\\" So, the two shorter sides are both W, so the midpoints are at W/2 on each of those sides.But in the triangle, each shorter side is only one: the vertical side of length W. So, the midpoint is at (0, W/2). Similarly, the midpoint of the longer side (L) is at (L/2, 0).Wait, maybe the two cuts are:- A horizontal cut at W/2, parallel to the shorter side (W).- A vertical cut at L/2, parallel to the longer side (L).But in the triangle, making a horizontal cut at W/2 would create a smaller triangle on top and a trapezoid at the bottom. Similarly, making a vertical cut at L/2 would create a smaller triangle on the side and a trapezoid.But the problem says that after these two cuts, a rectangle remains. So, perhaps the intersection of these two cuts forms a rectangle inside the triangle.Wait, if I make a horizontal cut at W/2 and a vertical cut at L/2, their intersection would form a rectangle with sides (L - L/2) and (W - W/2), which is L/2 and W/2. So, the remaining rectangle would have dimensions L/2 and W/2, and its perimeter would be 2(L/2 + W/2) = L + W.But the problem says the perimeter of the remaining rectangle is 129 cm. So, if L + W = 129, then the perimeter of the original rectangle would be 2(L + W) = 2*129 = 258 cm.Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me verify.If the original rectangle has perimeter 2(L + W). After cutting along the diagonal, we have two triangles. On one triangle, we make two cuts: one parallel to W at W/2, and one parallel to L at L/2. The intersection of these cuts would form a smaller rectangle inside the triangle, with sides L/2 and W/2. So, the perimeter of this smaller rectangle is 2(L/2 + W/2) = L + W.Given that this perimeter is 129 cm, so L + W = 129. Therefore, the original perimeter is 2(L + W) = 258 cm.But wait, let me think again. The remaining figure is a rectangle, but is it really L/2 by W/2? Or is it something else?Wait, in the triangle, making a horizontal cut at W/2 would create a smaller triangle with height W/2 and base L*(W/2)/W = L/2, because the triangles are similar. Similarly, making a vertical cut at L/2 would create a smaller triangle with base L/2 and height W*(L/2)/L = W/2.So, the intersection of these two cuts would indeed form a rectangle with sides L/2 and W/2. So, the perimeter is 2(L/2 + W/2) = L + W = 129 cm. Therefore, the original perimeter is 2(L + W) = 258 cm.Wait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose L = 100 cm, W = 29 cm. Then L + W = 129 cm, perimeter of original rectangle is 2*(100 + 29) = 258 cm. After cutting along the diagonal, making two cuts at midpoints, the remaining rectangle would be 50 cm by 14.5 cm, perimeter 2*(50 + 14.5) = 129 cm. That checks out.So, I think that's the answer: 258 cm.**Final Answer**The perimeter of the original sheet was boxed{258} centimeters."},{"question":"In a class activity, a group consisting of 4 boys and 2 girls stands in a row for a performance:  (I) If the two girls cannot stand next to each other, how many different arrangements are there?

(The heights of A, B, and C are all different)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about arranging a group of 4 boys and 2 girls in a row for a performance. There are four parts to the problem, and I need to figure out each one step by step. Let me start with part (I).**Problem (I): If the two girls cannot stand next to each other, how many different arrangements are there?**Hmm, okay. So we have 6 people in total: 4 boys and 2 girls. We need to arrange them in a row such that the two girls are not next to each other. I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions and then subtract the number of arrangements where the girls are next to each other.First, let's find the total number of arrangements without any restrictions. Since there are 6 people, the total number of ways to arrange them is 6 factorial, which is 6! = 720.Now, let's calculate the number of arrangements where the two girls are standing next to each other. To do this, I can treat the two girls as a single entity or \\"block.\\" So instead of having 6 individuals, we now have 5 entities: the block of two girls and the 4 boys.The number of ways to arrange these 5 entities is 5! = 120. But within the block, the two girls can switch places. Since there are 2 girls, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange them within the block. So the total number of arrangements where the two girls are next to each other is 5! * 2! = 120 * 2 = 240.Wait, hold on. That seems high. Let me double-check. If we have 6 people, treating two as a block gives 5 units, which is 5! = 120. Each block can be arranged in 2 ways, so 120 * 2 = 240. Yeah, that seems right.So, to find the number of arrangements where the girls are not next to each other, we subtract the number of restricted arrangements from the total. That would be 720 - 240 = 480.But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Sometimes when subtracting, it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, another method is to arrange the boys first and then place the girls in the gaps.So, arranging the 4 boys first. The number of ways to arrange 4 boys is 4! = 24. Now, once the boys are arranged, there are 5 possible gaps where the girls can be placed: one before the first boy, one between each pair of boys, and one after the last boy. So, like this: _ B _ B _ B _ B _.We need to choose 2 gaps out of these 5 to place the two girls. The number of ways to choose 2 gaps is C(5,2) = 10. Then, for each chosen gap, we can arrange the two girls in 2! = 2 ways. So the total number of arrangements is 4! * C(5,2) * 2! = 24 * 10 * 2 = 480.Okay, so both methods give me 480, so that seems consistent. So, I think 480 is the correct answer for part (I).**Problem (II): If girl A cannot stand at the left end and girl B cannot stand at the right end, how many different arrangements are there?**Alright, so now we have two specific restrictions: girl A can't be at the left end, and girl B can't be at the right end. Let me think about how to approach this.One way to handle such restrictions is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. First, calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions, which is 6! = 720.Then, subtract the number of arrangements where girl A is at the left end and the number where girl B is at the right end. But then, we have to add back the number of arrangements where both girl A is at the left end and girl B is at the right end, because we subtracted them twice.So, let's break it down.First, total arrangements: 720.Number of arrangements where girl A is at the left end: If A is fixed at the left end, we have 5 remaining people to arrange. So, 5! = 120.Similarly, number of arrangements where girl B is at the right end: Fix B at the right end, so we have 5 remaining people to arrange. That's also 5! = 120.Now, number of arrangements where both A is at the left end and B is at the right end: Fix A at the left and B at the right. Then, we have 4 remaining people to arrange in the middle 4 positions. So, 4! = 24.Using inclusion-exclusion, the number of arrangements violating the restrictions is 120 + 120 - 24 = 216.Therefore, the number of valid arrangements is total arrangements minus violating arrangements: 720 - 216 = 504.Wait, let me make sure. So, total is 720. Subtract the ones where A is at left (120) and where B is at right (120), but since some arrangements have both A at left and B at right, we subtracted them twice, so we need to add them back once. So, 720 - 120 - 120 + 24 = 504. Yep, that seems correct.Alternatively, another way is to calculate directly the number of valid arrangements. Let's see:We have 6 positions. Girl A cannot be at position 1, and girl B cannot be at position 6.So, first, let's consider arranging all 6 people with these restrictions.We can think of it as:Total arrangements: 6! = 720.Number of arrangements where A is at position 1: 5! = 120.Number of arrangements where B is at position 6: 5! = 120.Number of arrangements where A is at position 1 AND B is at position 6: 4! = 24.So, the number of arrangements where either A is at position 1 or B is at position 6 is 120 + 120 - 24 = 216.Thus, the number of valid arrangements is 720 - 216 = 504. Same result.Alternatively, maybe we can calculate it directly by considering the positions for A and B.First, choose a position for A: A cannot be at position 1, so A has 5 choices.Then, choose a position for B: B cannot be at position 6, but also cannot be at the same position as A. So, if A is not at position 6, B has 5 - 1 = 4 choices (since B can't be at position 6 or where A is). Wait, but if A is at position 6, then B can't be at position 6, so B has 5 choices. Hmm, this seems more complicated.Wait, maybe it's better to split into cases.Case 1: A is at position 6.If A is at position 6, then B cannot be at position 6, but since A is already there, B can be anywhere else except position 6. But wait, B is a different person, so B can be anywhere except position 6. So, if A is at position 6, then B has 5 choices (positions 1-5). Then, the remaining 4 people can be arranged in 4! ways.So, number of arrangements in this case: 1 (A at 6) * 5 (B's positions) * 4! = 1 * 5 * 24 = 120.Case 2: A is not at position 6.Then, A has 4 choices (positions 2-5). Then, B cannot be at position 6, so B has 5 - 1 = 4 choices (since B can't be at position 6 and can't be at the same position as A). Wait, no, actually, if A is not at position 6, then B can be at position 6 or not. But B cannot be at position 6. So, if A is not at position 6, B has 5 - 1 = 4 choices (positions 1-5, excluding A's position). Then, the remaining 4 people can be arranged in 4! ways.So, number of arrangements in this case: 4 (A's positions) * 4 (B's positions) * 4! = 4 * 4 * 24 = 384.Wait, but hold on. If A is not at position 6, and B is also not at position 6, then the total number of arrangements is 4 (A's positions) * 4 (B's positions) * 4! = 384.But wait, adding case 1 and case 2: 120 + 384 = 504. Which matches the previous result. So, that seems correct.Therefore, the answer is 504.**Problem (III): How many different arrangements are there if the 4 boys stand next to each other?**Alright, so now the condition is that the 4 boys must stand next to each other. So, they form a block. Let me think.If the 4 boys must stand next to each other, we can treat them as a single entity or block. So, along with the 2 girls, we have 3 entities: the block of boys and the two girls.The number of ways to arrange these 3 entities is 3! = 6.But within the block of boys, the 4 boys can be arranged among themselves in 4! = 24 ways.Additionally, the two girls can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways.Wait, no. Wait, the girls are separate entities, so when we arrange the 3 entities (boys block, girl 1, girl 2), the girls can be in any order. So, the total number of arrangements is 3! * 4! * 2!.Wait, hold on. Let me clarify.The total number of entities is 3: the boys block, girl A, and girl B. The number of ways to arrange these 3 is 3! = 6.Within the boys block, the 4 boys can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.The girls are separate, so their arrangement is already considered in the 3! term. So, the total number of arrangements is 3! * 4! = 6 * 24 = 144.Wait, but hold on, are the girls considered as separate entities? Yes, so when we arrange the 3 entities, the girls can be in any order, so that's already included in the 3!.So, the total number is 3! * 4! = 144.Alternatively, another way: treat the boys as a single block, so we have 3 units: [BBBB], G, G. The number of ways to arrange these is 3! = 6. Then, arrange the boys within their block: 4! = 24. So, total arrangements: 6 * 24 = 144.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, if the girls were also required to be together, it would be different, but in this case, only the boys need to be together. So, the girls can be anywhere else.Wait, but hold on, in the initial problem statement, it's 4 boys and 2 girls. So, when we treat the boys as a block, the girls are separate. So, the total number of units is 3: the boys block, girl 1, girl 2.So, arranging these 3 units: 3! = 6.Within the boys block: 4! = 24.So, total arrangements: 6 * 24 = 144.Yes, that seems correct.Wait, but another thought: is the girls' arrangement considered? Since the girls are separate, their order is already included in the 3! term. So, we don't need to multiply by 2! for the girls. So, 3! * 4! = 6 * 24 = 144.Yes, that's correct.So, the answer is 144.**Problem (IV): How many different arrangements are there for A, B, and C to stand from left to right in order of height? (The heights of A, B, and C are all different)**Alright, so now we have a different condition: A, B, and C must stand from left to right in order of height. The heights are all different, so there is a specific order they must follow.First, let me clarify: are A, B, and C among the 4 boys and 2 girls? The problem says \\"for A, B, and C to stand from left to right in order of height.\\" So, I think A, B, and C are specific individuals, possibly boys or girls. But in the initial group, we have 4 boys and 2 girls. So, perhaps A, B, and C are among these 6 people.Wait, the problem says \\"the heights of A, B, and C are all different.\\" So, they are distinct individuals with distinct heights. So, we need to arrange all 6 people such that A, B, and C are in increasing order of height from left to right.Hmm, okay. So, regardless of their positions, as long as A is to the left of B, and B is to the left of C, and their heights are in order.Wait, but the problem says \\"stand from left to right in order of height.\\" So, does that mean that A must be the shortest, then B, then C? Or just that their heights are in increasing order from left to right, but not necessarily A, B, C specifically?Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says \\"for A, B, and C to stand from left to right in order of height.\\" So, I think it means that A, B, and C must be arranged in the order of their heights, from shortest to tallest, from left to right.So, if A is the shortest, then B, then C, then in the arrangement, A must come before B, who must come before C.But the problem doesn't specify that A, B, and C are the only ones with distinct heights, just that their heights are all different. So, perhaps A, B, and C are three specific people among the 6, and their heights are different, so we need to arrange the 6 people such that A, B, and C are in increasing order of height from left to right.So, how do we calculate that?I remember that when we have a set of people and we want a specific subset to be in a certain order, the number of valid arrangements is total arrangements divided by the number of permutations of the subset.In this case, the total number of arrangements is 6! = 720.For any specific three people, the number of ways they can be arranged in order is 3! = 6. But since we want only one specific order (increasing height), the number of valid arrangements is 6! / 3! = 720 / 6 = 120.Wait, is that correct? Let me think.Yes, because for any permutation of the 6 people, the three specific people A, B, and C can be arranged in 3! ways, but only one of those ways is the desired order. So, the total number of valid arrangements is 6! / 3! = 120.Alternatively, another way: choose positions for A, B, and C such that they are in increasing order of height. The number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 6 is C(6,3) = 20. For each such choice, there's only one way to arrange A, B, and C in order of height. Then, arrange the remaining 3 people in the remaining 3 positions, which is 3! = 6. So, total arrangements: C(6,3) * 1 * 3! = 20 * 6 = 120.Yes, that also gives 120. So, that seems consistent.Therefore, the answer is 120.Wait, but hold on. Is A, B, and C among the 4 boys and 2 girls? The problem doesn't specify, but it says \\"for A, B, and C to stand from left to right in order of height.\\" So, I think A, B, and C are specific individuals in the group, regardless of gender. So, they could be boys or girls.But in the initial group, we have 4 boys and 2 girls. So, if A, B, and C are among these 6, then the above reasoning still holds.Yes, so regardless of their gender, the number of arrangements where A, B, and C are in increasing order of height is 6! / 3! = 120.So, the answer is 120.**Final Answer**(I) boxed{480}(II) boxed{504}(III) boxed{144}(IV) boxed{120}"},{"question":"A pyramid has a square base.

I need to find the value of p. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.So, the equation is:12³ = (9² / 3) * 2^{12p}Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, maybe I should compute the numerical values of each part to simplify the equation. That might make it easier to solve for p.Starting with 12³. I know that 12 squared is 144, so 12 cubed is 12 * 144. Let me calculate that. 12 times 100 is 1200, 12 times 44 is 528, so adding those together, 1200 + 528 is 1728. So, 12³ is 1728.Next, let's compute 9². 9 squared is 81. Then, 81 divided by 3 is 27. So, the term (9² / 3) simplifies to 27.So now, the equation becomes:1728 = 27 * 2^{12p}Okay, so now I have 1728 equals 27 multiplied by 2 to the power of 12p. I need to solve for p. Let me think about how to isolate p here.First, maybe I can divide both sides of the equation by 27 to get rid of that coefficient. Let's do that.1728 divided by 27. Hmm, let me compute that. 27 goes into 1728 how many times? Well, 27 times 60 is 1620, and 27 times 44 is 1188, but wait, that might not be the quickest way. Alternatively, I know that 27 is 3³, and 1728 is 12³, which is (2² * 3)³, so 2^6 * 3³. So, 1728 divided by 27 is 2^6, which is 64. Let me verify that: 27 times 64. 27 times 60 is 1620, and 27 times 4 is 108, so 1620 + 108 is 1728. Yes, that works. So, 1728 divided by 27 is 64.So, after dividing both sides by 27, the equation becomes:64 = 2^{12p}Alright, now I have 64 equals 2 raised to the power of 12p. I need to solve for p. Since 64 is a power of 2, I can express it as 2 to some exponent, which will make it easier to solve for p.I know that 2^6 is 64 because 2^1 is 2, 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32, and 2^6 is 64. So, 64 is 2^6.Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as:2^6 = 2^{12p}Since the bases are the same (both are base 2), the exponents must be equal. So, I can set the exponents equal to each other:6 = 12pNow, solving for p, I can divide both sides by 12:p = 6 / 12Simplifying that, 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, or 1/2. So, p is 1/2.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Calculated 12³ correctly: 12 * 12 = 144, 144 * 12 = 1728. That seems right.2. Calculated 9² / 3: 9² is 81, divided by 3 is 27. Correct.3. Divided 1728 by 27 to get 64. Yes, 27 * 64 = 1728. That's correct.4. Expressed 64 as 2^6. Correct, since 2^6 is 64.5. Set exponents equal: 6 = 12p. Divided both sides by 12 to get p = 6/12 = 1/2. That seems right.So, all the steps check out. Therefore, p is indeed 1/2.Alternatively, just to make sure, I can plug p = 1/2 back into the original equation and see if both sides are equal.Original equation: 12³ = (9² / 3) * 2^{12p}Left side: 12³ = 1728.Right side: (9² / 3) * 2^{12*(1/2)} = (81 / 3) * 2^{6} = 27 * 64 = 1728.Yes, both sides are equal, so p = 1/2 is the correct solution.I think that's thorough enough.

Find the value of S_9.","answer":"Okay, so I have this sequence {a_n} where each term is defined differently depending on whether n is odd or even. Let me write that down to make sure I understand it correctly.The sequence is defined as:- a_n = 2^{n-1} if n is an odd positive integer.- a_n = 2n - 1 if n is an even positive integer.And I need to find S_9, which is the sum of the first 9 terms of this sequence. Hmm, okay. So first, I should figure out what each of the first 9 terms is, and then add them up.Let me list the terms from n=1 to n=9. For each n, I'll determine if it's odd or even and then apply the corresponding formula.Starting with n=1:- n=1 is odd, so a_1 = 2^{1-1} = 2^0 = 1.n=2:- n=2 is even, so a_2 = 2*2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3.n=3:- n=3 is odd, so a_3 = 2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4.n=4:- n=4 is even, so a_4 = 2*4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7.n=5:- n=5 is odd, so a_5 = 2^{5-1} = 2^4 = 16.n=6:- n=6 is even, so a_6 = 2*6 - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11.n=7:- n=7 is odd, so a_7 = 2^{7-1} = 2^6 = 64.n=8:- n=8 is even, so a_8 = 2*8 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15.n=9:- n=9 is odd, so a_9 = 2^{9-1} = 2^8 = 256.Okay, so now I have all the terms from a_1 to a_9. Let me list them again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:a_1 = 1  a_2 = 3  a_3 = 4  a_4 = 7  a_5 = 16  a_6 = 11  a_7 = 64  a_8 = 15  a_9 = 256Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the calculations because some of these numbers seem to jump around a lot, especially a_5 is 16 and a_7 is 64, which are powers of 2, but a_3 is 4, which is also a power of 2. On the even terms, a_2 is 3, a_4 is 7, a_6 is 11, a_8 is 15. Hmm, those seem to follow a pattern too. Let me see.For the odd terms:- a_1 = 1 = 2^0- a_3 = 4 = 2^2- a_5 = 16 = 2^4- a_7 = 64 = 2^6- a_9 = 256 = 2^8So, for odd n, a_n = 2^{n-1}, which is 2^{(2k-1)-1} = 2^{2k-2} when n is the k-th odd number. So, the exponents are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, etc., which makes sense.For the even terms:- a_2 = 3 = 2*2 - 1- a_4 = 7 = 2*4 - 1- a_6 = 11 = 2*6 - 1- a_8 = 15 = 2*8 - 1So, each even term is just 2n - 1, which gives 3, 7, 11, 15 for n=2,4,6,8. That seems consistent.Okay, so the terms are correct. Now, I need to sum these up. Let me list them again:1, 3, 4, 7, 16, 11, 64, 15, 256.Let me add them step by step.Start with S_1 = 1.Then S_2 = S_1 + a_2 = 1 + 3 = 4.S_3 = S_2 + a_3 = 4 + 4 = 8.S_4 = S_3 + a_4 = 8 + 7 = 15.S_5 = S_4 + a_5 = 15 + 16 = 31.S_6 = S_5 + a_6 = 31 + 11 = 42.S_7 = S_6 + a_7 = 42 + 64 = 106.S_8 = S_7 + a_8 = 106 + 15 = 121.S_9 = S_8 + a_9 = 121 + 256 = 377.Wait, so S_9 is 377? Hmm, let me check my addition step by step because that seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.Alternatively, maybe I can group the terms differently to make the addition easier.Looking at the terms:Odd terms: a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7, a_9. These are 1, 4, 16, 64, 256.Even terms: a_2, a_4, a_6, a_8. These are 3, 7, 11, 15.So, perhaps I can sum the odd terms and the even terms separately and then add them together.Sum of odd terms: 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256.Let me compute that:1 + 4 = 5  5 + 16 = 21  21 + 64 = 85  85 + 256 = 341.Sum of even terms: 3 + 7 + 11 + 15.Compute that:3 + 7 = 10  10 + 11 = 21  21 + 15 = 36.So, total sum S_9 = sum of odd terms + sum of even terms = 341 + 36 = 377.Okay, same result. So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the sum instead of adding term by term.Looking at the odd terms: they form a geometric sequence where each term is 4 times the previous term. Let me see:a_1 = 1  a_3 = 4 = 1 * 4  a_5 = 16 = 4 * 4  a_7 = 64 = 16 * 4  a_9 = 256 = 64 * 4Yes, so it's a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio 4, and there are 5 terms (since n=1,3,5,7,9). The sum of a geometric series is S = a1*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). So:Sum of odd terms = 1*(4^5 - 1)/(4 - 1) = (1024 - 1)/3 = 1023/3 = 341. That matches what I got earlier.Now, for the even terms: 3, 7, 11, 15. These are arithmetic sequences? Let me check the differences:7 - 3 = 4  11 - 7 = 4  15 - 11 = 4Yes, so it's an arithmetic sequence with first term 3, common difference 4, and 4 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2*(2a1 + (n-1)d). So:Sum of even terms = 4/2*(2*3 + (4-1)*4) = 2*(6 + 12) = 2*18 = 36. That also matches my earlier calculation.So, adding 341 + 36 gives 377. Therefore, S_9 = 377.Just to make sure, let me recount the terms:a1=1, a2=3, a3=4, a4=7, a5=16, a6=11, a7=64, a8=15, a9=256.Adding them up:1 + 3 = 4  4 + 4 = 8  8 + 7 = 15  15 + 16 = 31  31 + 11 = 42  42 + 64 = 106  106 + 15 = 121  121 + 256 = 377.Yes, that's consistent. So, I think 377 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( S_9 ) is boxed{377}."},{"question":"Let  a/b  be the probability that a randomly chosen positive divisor of  12^{2007}  is also a divisor of  12^{2000} , where  a  and  b  are relatively prime positive integers.  Find the remainder when  a+b  is divided by  2007 .","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen positive divisor of (12^{2007}) is also a divisor of (12^{2000}). Then, express this probability as a reduced fraction (frac{a}{b}), and find the remainder when (a + b) is divided by 2007.First, let me parse the problem. I need to consider the divisors of two numbers: (12^{2007}) and (12^{2000}). The probability is the number of common divisors divided by the total number of divisors of (12^{2007}).So, step one: find the number of positive divisors of (12^{2007}) and (12^{2000}). Then, find how many of these divisors are common to both. The probability will be the ratio of the common divisors to the total divisors of (12^{2007}).To find the number of divisors, I remember that if a number is expressed in its prime factorization form, say (n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} dots p_k^{e_k}), then the number of positive divisors of (n) is ((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) dots (e_k + 1)).So, let me factorize 12. 12 is (2^2 times 3^1). Therefore, (12^{2007}) is ((2^2 times 3^1)^{2007}), which is (2^{4014} times 3^{2007}). Similarly, (12^{2000}) is (2^{4000} times 3^{2000}).Now, the number of positive divisors of (12^{2007}) is ((4014 + 1)(2007 + 1) = 4015 times 2008). Similarly, the number of positive divisors of (12^{2000}) is ((4000 + 1)(2000 + 1) = 4001 times 2001).But wait, I don't need the number of divisors of (12^{2000}) directly. Instead, I need the number of divisors that are common to both (12^{2007}) and (12^{2000}). That is, the number of common divisors is equal to the number of divisors of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of (12^{2007}) and (12^{2000}).Since (12^{2000}) divides (12^{2007}), the gcd of (12^{2007}) and (12^{2000}) is (12^{2000}). Therefore, the number of common divisors is equal to the number of divisors of (12^{2000}), which is (4001 times 2001).Wait, hold on. Let me think again. If (12^{2000}) divides (12^{2007}), then every divisor of (12^{2000}) is also a divisor of (12^{2007}). So, the number of common divisors is indeed equal to the number of divisors of (12^{2000}), which is (4001 times 2001).Therefore, the probability is (frac{4001 times 2001}{4015 times 2008}).Now, I need to simplify this fraction to its lowest terms, i.e., find (a) and (b) such that (frac{a}{b} = frac{4001 times 2001}{4015 times 2008}) with (gcd(a, b) = 1).So, let me write down the numerator and the denominator:Numerator: (4001 times 2001)Denominator: (4015 times 2008)I need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and the denominator to reduce the fraction.First, let me factor each number:Starting with 4001 and 4015.4015 - 4001 = 14. So, let's see if 14 is a factor.Wait, but 4001 is a prime? Let me check.Wait, 4001 divided by small primes:4001 ÷ 7: 7*571=4000 - 7, so 4001 is 7*571 + 4, so not divisible by 7.4001 ÷ 11: 11*363 = 3993, 4001 - 3993 = 8, not divisible by 11.4001 ÷ 13: 13*307=3991, 4001 - 3991=10, not divisible by 13.4001 ÷ 17: 17*235=3995, 4001 - 3995=6, not divisible by 17.4001 ÷ 19: 19*210=3990, 4001 - 3990=11, not divisible by 19.4001 ÷ 23: 23*173=3979, 4001 - 3979=22, which is divisible by 23? 22 ÷ 23 is not, so no.4001 ÷ 29: 29*137=3973, 4001 - 3973=28, not divisible by 29.4001 ÷ 31: 31*129=3999, 4001 - 3999=2, not divisible by 31.4001 ÷ 37: 37*108=3996, 4001 - 3996=5, not divisible by 37.So, 4001 seems prime? Maybe.Similarly, 4015: Let's factor 4015.4015 ÷ 5 = 803.803 ÷ 11 = 73, since 11*73=803.So, 4015 = 5 × 11 × 73.Similarly, 2001: Let's factor 2001.2001 ÷ 3 = 667.667 ÷ 23 = 29, since 23*29=667.So, 2001 = 3 × 23 × 29.2008: Let's factor 2008.2008 ÷ 2 = 10041004 ÷ 2 = 502502 ÷ 2 = 251251 is a prime.So, 2008 = 2^3 × 251.So, now, let's write numerator and denominator in their prime factors.Numerator: 4001 × 2001 = 4001 × 3 × 23 × 29Denominator: 4015 × 2008 = 5 × 11 × 73 × 2^3 × 251So, looking at numerator and denominator:Numerator: 4001, 3, 23, 29Denominator: 5, 11, 73, 2, 2, 2, 251Looking for common factors between numerator and denominator.Looking at the prime factors:Numerator primes: 3, 23, 29, 4001Denominator primes: 2, 5, 11, 73, 251So, no common prime factors between numerator and denominator. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.Wait, but hold on. 4001 and 4015: earlier, I thought 4001 is prime, but 4015 is 5 × 11 × 73. So, 4001 is a different prime, so no common factors. Similarly, 2001 is 3 × 23 × 29, and 2008 is 2^3 × 251, so no overlap.Therefore, the fraction (frac{4001 times 2001}{4015 times 2008}) is already in lowest terms, so (a = 4001 times 2001) and (b = 4015 times 2008).But wait, let me compute (a) and (b) to make sure.Compute (a = 4001 times 2001). Let's compute that:4001 × 2001: Let's compute 4000 × 2000 = 8,000,000Then, 4000 × 1 = 40001 × 2000 = 20001 × 1 = 1So, total is 8,000,000 + 4000 + 2000 + 1 = 8,006,001.Wait, that's 4001 × 2001 = 8,006,001.Similarly, compute (b = 4015 times 2008).Compute 4000 × 2000 = 8,000,0004000 × 8 = 32,00015 × 2000 = 30,00015 × 8 = 120So, total is 8,000,000 + 32,000 + 30,000 + 120 = 8,062,120.Wait, let me verify:Alternatively, 4015 × 2008 = (4000 + 15) × (2000 + 8) = 4000×2000 + 4000×8 + 15×2000 + 15×8 = 8,000,000 + 32,000 + 30,000 + 120 = 8,062,120. Yes, that seems correct.So, (a = 8,006,001) and (b = 8,062,120).Wait, but earlier I thought the fraction is already reduced, but let me confirm.Compute gcd(8,006,001, 8,062,120). If it's 1, then the fraction is reduced.Compute gcd(8,006,001, 8,062,120). Let's use the Euclidean algorithm.Compute 8,062,120 - 8,006,001 = 56,119.So, gcd(8,006,001, 56,119).Now compute 8,006,001 ÷ 56,119.Compute how many times 56,119 goes into 8,006,001.Compute 56,119 × 142 = ?56,119 × 100 = 5,611,90056,119 × 40 = 2,244,76056,119 × 2 = 112,238So, total 5,611,900 + 2,244,760 = 7,856,660 + 112,238 = 7,968,898Subtract from 8,006,001: 8,006,001 - 7,968,898 = 37,103.So, now gcd(56,119, 37,103).Compute 56,119 - 37,103 = 19,016.gcd(37,103, 19,016).Compute 37,103 ÷ 19,016 = 1 with remainder 37,103 - 19,016 = 18,087.gcd(19,016, 18,087).19,016 - 18,087 = 929.gcd(18,087, 929).Compute 18,087 ÷ 929.929 × 19 = 17,65118,087 - 17,651 = 436.gcd(929, 436).929 ÷ 436 = 2 with remainder 929 - 872 = 57.gcd(436, 57).436 ÷ 57 = 7 with remainder 436 - 399 = 37.gcd(57, 37).57 ÷ 37 = 1 with remainder 20.gcd(37, 20).37 ÷ 20 = 1 with remainder 17.gcd(20, 17).20 ÷ 17 = 1 with remainder 3.gcd(17, 3).17 ÷ 3 = 5 with remainder 2.gcd(3, 2).3 ÷ 2 = 1 with remainder 1.gcd(2, 1).Which is 1.Therefore, the gcd is 1. So, the fraction is indeed reduced, so (a = 8,006,001) and (b = 8,062,120).Now, the problem asks for (a + b) modulo 2007.So, compute (a + b = 8,006,001 + 8,062,120 = 16,068,121).Now, compute 16,068,121 mod 2007.To compute this, we can divide 16,068,121 by 2007 and find the remainder.But 2007 is 2007, which is 2007 = 2000 + 7.Alternatively, perhaps we can find 16,068,121 divided by 2007.But that's a bit tedious. Maybe we can find 16,068,121 mod 2007 by breaking it down.First, note that 2007 × 8000 = 2007 × 8 × 1000 = 16,056 × 1000 = 16,056,000.Subtract that from 16,068,121: 16,068,121 - 16,056,000 = 12,121.So, 16,068,121 = 2007 × 8000 + 12,121.Now, compute 12,121 mod 2007.Compute how many times 2007 goes into 12,121.Compute 2007 × 6 = 12,042.Subtract: 12,121 - 12,042 = 79.Therefore, 12,121 = 2007 × 6 + 79.So, 16,068,121 = 2007 × 8000 + 2007 × 6 + 79 = 2007 × 8006 + 79.Therefore, 16,068,121 mod 2007 is 79.Hence, the remainder when (a + b) is divided by 2007 is 79.Wait, let me verify that calculation again because 2007 × 8006 is 2007 × (8000 + 6) = 2007×8000 + 2007×6 = 16,056,000 + 12,042 = 16,068,042.Then, 16,068,042 + 79 = 16,068,121, which is correct.So, yes, the remainder is 79.Therefore, the answer is 79.**Final Answer**boxed{79}"},{"question":"Given x_{1} and x_{2} are the two roots of the quadratic equation x^{2}+2x-8=0, find x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}.","answer":"First, I recognize that the given quadratic equation is (x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the period of a cosine function is related to its argument, specifically the coefficient in front of x inside the cosine. First, let me recall the general form of a cosine function: f(x) = A cos(Bx + C) + D. In this form, A is the amplitude, B affects the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. The period of such a function is given by 2π divided by the absolute value of B. So, the formula for the period is Period = 2π / |B|.Looking back at the given function, f(x) = 3 cos(π/2 x - π/8). Let me rewrite this to match the general form. So, A is 3, B is π/2, C is -π/8, and D is 0. Therefore, the period should be 2π divided by |π/2|.Calculating that, 2π divided by π/2 is the same as multiplying 2π by 2/π, right? Let me write that out: 2π / (π/2) = 2π * (2/π). The π in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving 2 * 2 = 4. So, does that mean the period is 4?Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The formula is 2π / |B|, and B here is π/2. So, substituting, 2π / (π/2) is indeed 4. So, the period is 4. But just to double-check, let me think about what the period means. It's the length after which the function repeats itself.So, if I take x and x + period, the function should have the same value. Let me test it with a specific value. Let's pick x = 0. Then f(0) = 3 cos(-π/8). Now, let's compute f(0 + 4) = f(4) = 3 cos(π/2 * 4 - π/8) = 3 cos(2π - π/8). Cosine has a period of 2π, so cos(2π - π/8) is the same as cos(-π/8), which is equal to cos(π/8) because cosine is an even function. Wait, but f(0) is 3 cos(-π/8) which is also 3 cos(π/8). So, f(4) = f(0). That seems correct.Let me try another point. Let's take x = 1. Then f(1) = 3 cos(π/2 * 1 - π/8) = 3 cos(π/2 - π/8) = 3 cos(3π/8). Now, f(1 + 4) = f(5) = 3 cos(π/2 * 5 - π/8) = 3 cos(5π/2 - π/8). Let's simplify 5π/2 - π/8. 5π/2 is equal to 20π/8, so 20π/8 - π/8 = 19π/8. Now, 19π/8 is more than 2π, which is 16π/8. So, subtracting 2π, which is 16π/8, from 19π/8 gives 3π/8. So, cos(19π/8) = cos(3π/8). Therefore, f(5) = 3 cos(3π/8) = f(1). That also checks out.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's a smaller period. Maybe 2? Let's test if f(x + 2) = f(x). Let's take x = 0 again. f(0) = 3 cos(-π/8). f(0 + 2) = f(2) = 3 cos(π/2 * 2 - π/8) = 3 cos(π - π/8) = 3 cos(7π/8). Now, cos(7π/8) is not equal to cos(-π/8) because 7π/8 is in the second quadrant and -π/8 is in the fourth quadrant, and cosine is positive in the fourth quadrant and negative in the second quadrant. So, cos(7π/8) is negative, while cos(-π/8) is positive. Therefore, f(2) ≠ f(0). So, 2 is not a period.How about 1? Let's test x = 0. f(0) = 3 cos(-π/8). f(0 + 1) = f(1) = 3 cos(π/2 - π/8) = 3 cos(3π/8). cos(3π/8) is not equal to cos(-π/8) because 3π/8 is in the first quadrant and -π/8 is in the fourth quadrant, but their cosines are not equal. So, 1 is not a period either.What about 3? Let's try x = 0. f(0) = 3 cos(-π/8). f(0 + 3) = f(3) = 3 cos(π/2 * 3 - π/8) = 3 cos(3π/2 - π/8) = 3 cos(12π/8 - π/8) = 3 cos(11π/8). cos(11π/8) is in the third quadrant, which is negative, and it's not equal to cos(-π/8). So, 3 is not a period.How about 4? We already tested x = 0 and x = 1, and it worked. Let me test another point, say x = π/8. f(π/8) = 3 cos(π/2 * π/8 - π/8) = 3 cos(π²/16 - π/8). Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's compute f(π/8 + 4) = f(π/8 + 4) = 3 cos(π/2*(π/8 + 4) - π/8). Let's expand that: π/2 * π/8 + π/2 * 4 - π/8 = π²/16 + 2π - π/8. So, f(π/8 + 4) = 3 cos(π²/16 + 2π - π/8). Now, 2π is a full period, so cos(π²/16 + 2π - π/8) = cos(π²/16 - π/8). Therefore, f(π/8 + 4) = 3 cos(π²/16 - π/8) = f(π/8). So, that works too.Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the most convincing test. Maybe I should think about the function's graph. The standard cosine function has a period of 2π, but when you have a coefficient inside the argument, it affects the period. Specifically, if you have cos(Bx + C), the period is 2π / |B|. So, in this case, B is π/2, so the period should be 2π / (π/2) = 4. That seems consistent with what I calculated earlier.Is there any chance that the phase shift affects the period? I don't think so. The phase shift just moves the graph left or right, but it doesn't change how often the function repeats. So, the period remains the same regardless of the phase shift. Therefore, even though there's a -π/8 inside the cosine, it doesn't affect the period; it just shifts the graph.So, putting it all together, the function f(x) = 3 cos(π/2 x - π/8) has a period of 4. I've tested it with multiple points and also considered the general formula, so I'm pretty confident that 4 is the correct smallest positive period.**Final Answer**The smallest positive period of the function is boxed{4}."},{"question":"If one root of the equation x^{2}+2x-k=0 is 0, then the other root is ______.","answer":"To determine the other root of the equation ( x^2 + 2x - k = 0 ) when one root is 0, I can use the properties of quadratic equations.First, I'll substitute ( x = 0 ) into the equation to find the value of ( k ).

Therefore, my first task is to find the coordinates of point D, which is the midpoint of BC.To find the midpoint of BC, I can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint formula is given by:D = ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2)Where (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) are the coordinates of points B and C respectively. So plugging in the coordinates of B(-1,-2) and C(-3,4):D_x = (-1 + (-3))/2 = (-4)/2 = -2D_y = (-2 + 4)/2 = (2)/2 = 1So, the coordinates of point D are (-2,1). Got that down.Now, I need to find the equation of the line AD. Since I have two points, A(2,3) and D(-2,1), I can use the two-point form of the equation of a line. The two-point form is:(y - y₁) = ((y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁))(x - x₁)Where (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) are the coordinates of points A and D. Let me assign A as (x₁, y₁) = (2,3) and D as (x₂, y₂) = (-2,1).Calculating the slope first:Slope (m) = (1 - 3)/(-2 - 2) = (-2)/(-4) = 1/2So, the slope is 1/2. Now, using point A(2,3) to write the equation:y - 3 = (1/2)(x - 2)Let me simplify this equation:Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:2(y - 3) = (x - 2)2y - 6 = x - 2Bring all terms to one side:x - 2y + 4 = 0Wait, let me check that again. Starting from y - 3 = (1/2)(x - 2):Multiply both sides by 2:2y - 6 = x - 2Then, subtract x and add 6 to both sides:- x + 2y - 4 = 0Multiply both sides by -1 to make it look neater:x - 2y + 4 = 0Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can write it in slope-intercept form:y = (1/2)x + 1Wait, let me verify that. Starting from y - 3 = (1/2)(x - 2):y = (1/2)x - 1 + 3y = (1/2)x + 2Wait, that contradicts my previous result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my earlier steps.Let me go back. Starting from:y - 3 = (1/2)(x - 2)So, expanding:y = (1/2)x - (1/2)*2 + 3y = (1/2)x - 1 + 3y = (1/2)x + 2Yes, that's correct. So, the equation in slope-intercept form is y = (1/2)x + 2. Alternatively, in standard form, that would be:(1/2)x - y + 2 = 0Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:x - 2y + 4 = 0Wait, that's the same as before. So, both forms are consistent. So, the equation of the median AD is x - 2y + 4 = 0 or y = (1/2)x + 2. I think either form is acceptable, but maybe the problem expects a specific form. Since it just says \\"the equation of the line,\\" either should be fine, but perhaps standard form is more likely expected. So, I'll go with x - 2y + 4 = 0.Wait, let me double-check my calculations because I initially thought I made a mistake but now it seems consistent. Let me plug in point A(2,3) into the equation x - 2y + 4 = 0:2 - 2*3 + 4 = 2 - 6 + 4 = 0. Correct.Now, plug in point D(-2,1):-2 - 2*1 + 4 = -2 - 2 + 4 = 0. Correct.So, both points satisfy the equation, so the equation is correct. Okay, so part (I) is done.Moving on to part (II): finding the area of triangle ABC. I remember there are a few methods to find the area of a triangle given coordinates of its vertices. One common method is using the shoelace formula, which is given by:Area = |(x₁(y₂ - y₃) + x₂(y₃ - y₁) + x₃(y₁ - y₂))/2|Alternatively, it can also be written as:Area = |(x₁y₂ + x₂y₃ + x₃y₁ - x₂y₁ - x₃y₂ - x₁y₃)/2|Let me write down the coordinates again:A(2,3), B(-1,-2), C(-3,4)So, plugging into the shoelace formula:First, list the coordinates in order, repeating the first at the end:A(2,3), B(-1,-2), C(-3,4), A(2,3)Now, multiply diagonally and sum:Sum1 = (2*(-2) + (-1)*4 + (-3)*3) = (-4) + (-4) + (-9) = -17Sum2 = (3*(-1) + (-2)*(-3) + 4*2) = (-3) + 6 + 8 = 11Then, subtract Sum2 from Sum1:Area = |(-17 - 11)/2| = |(-28)/2| = | -14 | = 14Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the area is 14 square units.Alternatively, I can use vectors or base-height, but the shoelace formula is probably the quickest here.Wait, let me verify the shoelace formula step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Compute Sum1:x₁y₂ = 2*(-2) = -4x₂y₃ = (-1)*4 = -4x₃y₁ = (-3)*3 = -9Sum1 = (-4) + (-4) + (-9) = -17Compute Sum2:y₁x₂ = 3*(-1) = -3y₂x₃ = (-2)*(-3) = 6y₃x₁ = 4*2 = 8Sum2 = (-3) + 6 + 8 = 11Then, Area = |(Sum1 - Sum2)/2| = |(-17 - 11)/2| = |-28/2| = | -14 | = 14Yes, that's correct. So, the area is 14.Alternatively, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle using coordinates:Area = (1/2)| (x₁(y₂ - y₃) + x₂(y₃ - y₁) + x₃(y₁ - y₂)) |Plugging in the values:x₁ = 2, y₁ = 3x₂ = -1, y₂ = -2x₃ = -3, y₃ = 4So,Area = (1/2)| 2*(-2 - 4) + (-1)*(4 - 3) + (-3)*(3 - (-2)) |Compute each term:First term: 2*(-6) = -12Second term: (-1)*(1) = -1Third term: (-3)*(5) = -15Sum: (-12) + (-1) + (-15) = -28Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2:Area = (1/2)*| -28 | = (1/2)*28 = 14Same result. So, that's consistent.Alternatively, I could also find the lengths of the sides and use Heron's formula, but that might be more time-consuming. But just for thoroughness, let me try that method as well.First, find the lengths of sides AB, BC, and AC.Compute AB:Distance between A(2,3) and B(-1,-2):AB = sqrt[ (-1 - 2)^2 + (-2 - 3)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-3)^2 + (-5)^2 ] = sqrt[9 + 25] = sqrt[34]Compute BC:Distance between B(-1,-2) and C(-3,4):BC = sqrt[ (-3 - (-1))^2 + (4 - (-2))^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2)^2 + (6)^2 ] = sqrt[4 + 36] = sqrt[40] = 2*sqrt(10)Compute AC:Distance between A(2,3) and C(-3,4):AC = sqrt[ (-3 - 2)^2 + (4 - 3)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-5)^2 + (1)^2 ] = sqrt[25 + 1] = sqrt[26]So, sides are sqrt(34), 2*sqrt(10), and sqrt(26).Now, compute the semi-perimeter (s):s = (sqrt(34) + 2*sqrt(10) + sqrt(26))/2Hmm, that looks messy, but let's proceed.Then, Heron's formula is:Area = sqrt[ s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC) ]But this seems complicated because of the square roots. Maybe it's better to stick with the shoelace formula result since Heron's formula here would involve a lot of computation and potential approximation errors.Alternatively, another method is to use vectors and compute the cross product.Vectors AB and AC can be found as:Vector AB = B - A = (-1 - 2, -2 - 3) = (-3, -5)Vector AC = C - A = (-3 - 2, 4 - 3) = (-5, 1)The area is (1/2)|AB × AC|, where × denotes the cross product.In 2D, the cross product is scalar and given by:AB × AC = (-3)(1) - (-5)(-5) = (-3) - (25) = -28So, the area is (1/2)|-28| = 14. Same result as before.Therefore, regardless of the method, the area is 14.So, to recap:(I) The equation of median AD is x - 2y + 4 = 0.(II) The area of triangle ABC is 14.I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and I cross-verified using different methods, so I'm confident in these answers.**Final Answer**(I) The equation of the median AD is boxed{x - 2y + 4 = 0}.(II) The area of triangle ABC is boxed{14}."},{"question":"Select some numbers from (1, 2, 3, ldots, 9, 10) so that each of the 20 numbers (1, 2, 3, ldots, 19, 20) is equal to one of the selected numbers or the sum of two selected numbers (they can be the same). How many numbers need to be selected at least?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to select the smallest number of numbers from 1 to 10 such that every number from 1 to 20 can be expressed as either one of the selected numbers or the sum of two selected numbers. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me understand the problem clearly. I have to choose a subset S from {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}. Then, for every number from 1 to 20, it should either be in S or be the sum of two numbers from S. The goal is to find the smallest possible size of S.So, this seems related to something called additive bases in mathematics. I remember that an additive basis is a set of numbers such that every number in a certain range can be expressed as the sum of a limited number of elements from the set. In this case, it's a basis of order 2 because we're allowed sums of two numbers.I think the minimal size of such a basis is what we're looking for. Let me try to approach this systematically.First, let's note that the numbers from 1 to 10 are the building blocks. The numbers we need to cover are from 1 to 20. So, the selected numbers must be able to cover all these through their sums.Let me think about the largest number, 20. To get 20, we can either have 20 in our set S, or we can have two numbers in S that add up to 20. Since 20 is larger than 10, we can't have 20 in S. So, we need two numbers in S that add up to 20. The maximum number in S is 10, so 10 + 10 = 20. So, if we include 10 in S, we can get 20 by adding 10 and 10.Wait, but 10 is already in S, so that's fine. So, 10 is necessary because otherwise, we can't get 20. So, 10 is definitely in S.Similarly, let's think about 19. To get 19, we can have 19 in S, but 19 is beyond our selection range (we can only select up to 10). So, we need two numbers in S that add up to 19. The largest number we can use is 10, so 10 + 9 = 19. So, we need 9 in S as well.Wait, but 9 is within 1 to 10, so we can include 9. So, 9 is necessary because otherwise, we can't get 19.Similarly, let's check 18. 18 can be 9 + 9 or 10 + 8. So, if we have 9, we can get 18 by 9 + 9. Alternatively, if we have 8, we can get 18 by 10 + 8. So, 8 is not necessarily required if we have 9. Hmm, so maybe 9 is more important because it's needed for 19.But let's continue.17: 10 + 7 or 9 + 8. So, if we have 7 and 10, we can get 17. Alternatively, if we have 9 and 8, we can get 17. So, 7 or 8 might be needed.16: 10 + 6, 9 + 7, 8 + 8. So, similar logic. If we have 6, 7, or 8, we can get 16.15: 10 + 5, 9 + 6, 8 + 7. So, 5, 6, 7, or 8.14: 10 + 4, 9 + 5, 8 + 6, 7 + 7.13: 10 + 3, 9 + 4, 8 + 5, 7 + 6.12: 10 + 2, 9 + 3, 8 + 4, 7 + 5, 6 + 6.11: 10 + 1, 9 + 2, 8 + 3, 7 + 4, 6 + 5.10: already in S.9: already in S.8: ?Wait, so let's think about numbers from 1 to 10. We have to include 10 and 9 because they are necessary for 19 and 20.But what about the other numbers?Let me try to see if I can cover all numbers from 1 to 20 with a minimal set S.Let me start by including 10 and 9.So, S = {9, 10}.Now, let's see what numbers we can cover.From S, we can get:9, 10.Sums:9 + 9 = 18,9 + 10 = 19,10 + 10 = 20.So, with S = {9, 10}, we can cover 9, 10, 18, 19, 20.But we still need to cover 1 to 8, 11 to 17.So, we need to add more numbers to S.Let me think about the lower numbers. 1 is the smallest. To get 1, we need 1 in S because 1 can't be expressed as the sum of two numbers from S unless one of them is 1. So, 1 must be in S.So, S = {1, 9, 10}.Now, with 1, we can get 1, and the sums:1 + 1 = 2,1 + 9 = 10,1 + 10 = 11.So, now, we can cover 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20.Still missing: 3,4,5,6,7,8,12,13,14,15,16,17.Hmm, okay.Next, let's think about 3. To get 3, we can either have 3 in S or have 1 + 2. But 2 is already covered by 1 + 1. So, if we have 2, we can get 3 as 1 + 2. But 2 is not in S yet. So, do we need to include 2?Wait, 2 is already covered as 1 + 1. So, 2 is covered. Then, 3 can be 1 + 2, but since 2 is not in S, but 2 is covered as a sum, does that mean 3 can be covered as 1 + (1 + 1)? Wait, no, because we can only use two numbers from S. So, 3 must be either in S or the sum of two numbers from S. Since 2 is not in S, we can't do 1 + 2. So, 3 must be in S.So, S = {1, 3, 9, 10}.Now, with 3, we can get:3,1 + 3 = 4,3 + 3 = 6,3 + 9 = 12,3 + 10 = 13.So, now, we can cover 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20.Still missing: 5, 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17.Okay, moving on.To get 5, we can have 5 in S or have 1 + 4 or 2 + 3. But 4 is covered as 1 + 3, and 2 is covered as 1 + 1, but 2 is not in S. So, 2 + 3 would require 2 in S, which we don't have. So, 5 must be in S or 4 must be in S. Wait, 4 is covered as 1 + 3, but 4 itself is not in S. So, 5 can be 1 + 4, but since 4 is not in S, we can't do that. So, 5 must be in S.So, S = {1, 3, 5, 9, 10}.Now, with 5, we can get:5,1 + 5 = 6 (already covered),3 + 5 = 8,5 + 5 = 10 (already covered),5 + 9 = 14,5 + 10 = 15.So, now, we can cover 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20.Still missing: 7, 16, 17.Hmm, okay.Next, 7. To get 7, we can have 7 in S or have 1 + 6, 2 + 5, 3 + 4. Let's see:- 1 + 6: 6 is covered as 3 + 3, but 6 is not in S.- 2 + 5: 2 is not in S, 5 is in S.- 3 + 4: 3 is in S, 4 is covered as 1 + 3, but 4 is not in S.So, 7 can't be expressed as the sum of two numbers from S unless we include 7.So, S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}.Now, with 7, we can get:7,1 + 7 = 8 (already covered),3 + 7 = 10 (already covered),5 + 7 = 12 (already covered),7 + 7 = 14 (already covered),7 + 9 = 16,7 + 10 = 17.So, now, we can cover 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.Wait, that's all of them! So, with S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}, we can cover all numbers from 1 to 20.But let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.Let's list all numbers from 1 to 20 and see if they can be expressed as either in S or sum of two in S.1: in S.2: 1 + 1.3: in S.4: 1 + 3.5: in S.6: 3 + 3.7: in S.8: 3 + 5.9: in S.10: in S.11: 1 + 10.12: 3 + 9.13: 5 + 8? Wait, 8 is not in S. Wait, 13: 5 + 8, but 8 is not in S. Wait, did I make a mistake here?Wait, 13 was covered by 5 + 8, but 8 is not in S. Wait, how did I get 13 earlier? Because 5 + 8 is 13, but 8 is not in S. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier step.Wait, in the step where I added 5, I thought 5 + 8 would cover 13, but 8 is not in S. So, actually, 13 is not covered unless we have another way.Wait, 13 can be 1 + 12. 12 is covered as 3 + 9, but 12 is not in S. So, 1 + 12 is not possible because 12 is not in S. Alternatively, 3 + 10 = 13. 3 is in S, 10 is in S. So, 3 + 10 = 13. So, that's covered.Similarly, 14: 5 + 9.15: 5 + 10.16: 7 + 9.17: 7 + 10.18: 9 + 9.19: 9 + 10.20: 10 + 10.So, actually, 13 is covered by 3 + 10, which is fine.So, all numbers are covered.So, S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10} is a set of size 6 that covers all numbers from 1 to 20.But wait, is 6 the minimal size? Maybe we can do better.Let me see if we can reduce the size of S by removing some elements and see if we can still cover all numbers.Let me try removing 10. If we remove 10, can we still cover 20? 20 would need to be 10 + 10, but 10 is not in S anymore. So, we can't cover 20. So, 10 is necessary.What about removing 9? If we remove 9, can we cover 19? 19 would need to be 10 + 9, but 9 is not in S. So, we can't cover 19. So, 9 is necessary.What about removing 7? If we remove 7, can we cover 16 and 17?16: 7 + 9. Without 7, we need another way. 16 can be 8 + 8, but 8 is not in S. 16 can be 10 + 6, but 6 is not in S. 16 can be 9 + 7, but 7 is not in S. So, we can't cover 16. Similarly, 17: 7 + 10. Without 7, 17 can't be covered. So, 7 is necessary.What about removing 5? If we remove 5, can we cover 14 and 15?14: 5 + 9. Without 5, 14 can be 7 + 7. 7 is in S, so 7 + 7 = 14. So, 14 is covered.15: 5 + 10. Without 5, 15 can be 6 + 9, but 6 is not in S. 15 can be 7 + 8, but 8 is not in S. 15 can be 10 + 5, but 5 is not in S. So, 15 is not covered. So, 5 is necessary.What about removing 3? If we remove 3, can we cover 4, 6, 12, 13?4: 1 + 3. Without 3, 4 can be 2 + 2, but 2 is not in S. 4 can be 1 + 3, but 3 is not in S. So, 4 is not covered. So, 3 is necessary.What about removing 1? If we remove 1, can we cover 2?2: 1 + 1. Without 1, 2 cannot be covered. So, 1 is necessary.So, it seems that all elements in S are necessary. Therefore, the minimal size is 6.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a different set with fewer elements.Let me try another approach. Maybe instead of including 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, I can include some other numbers to cover more ranges.For example, if I include 2, maybe I can cover more numbers with fewer elements.Let me try constructing another set.Suppose S = {1, 2, 5, 10}.Let's see what we can cover.1: in S.2: in S.3: 1 + 2.4: 2 + 2.5: in S.6: 1 + 5.7: 2 + 5.8: 5 + 3, but 3 is not in S. Alternatively, 1 + 7, but 7 is not in S. So, 8 is not covered.Hmm, so 8 is missing. So, we need to include 8 or another number to cover 8.If I include 8, then S = {1, 2, 5, 8, 10}.Now, let's see:1: in S.2: in S.3: 1 + 2.4: 2 + 2.5: in S.6: 1 + 5.7: 2 + 5.8: in S.9: 1 + 8.10: in S.11: 1 + 10.12: 2 + 10.13: 5 + 8.14: 5 + 9, but 9 is not in S. Alternatively, 8 + 6, but 6 is not in S. So, 14 is not covered.Hmm, 14 is missing. So, we need to cover 14.14 can be 7 + 7, but 7 is not in S. 14 can be 5 + 9, but 9 is not in S. 14 can be 8 + 6, but 6 is not in S. So, we need to include another number.If I include 7, then S = {1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10}.Now, let's check:14: 7 + 7.15: 5 + 10.16: 8 + 8.17: 7 + 10.18: 8 + 10.19: 9 + 10, but 9 is not in S. Alternatively, 10 + 9, but 9 is not in S. So, 19 is missing.So, 19 is not covered. So, we need to include 9 or find another way.If we include 9, S becomes {1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}, which is size 7, which is worse than our previous set of size 6.Alternatively, can we cover 19 without including 9?19 can be 10 + 9, but 9 is not in S. 19 can be 8 + 11, but 11 is not in S. 19 can be 7 + 12, but 12 is not in S. So, no, we can't cover 19 without including 9 or another number that can sum to 19.So, this approach seems to require more numbers.Alternatively, maybe another set.Let me try S = {1, 4, 5, 10}.Check coverage:1: in S.2: 1 + 1.3: 1 + 2, but 2 is not in S. Alternatively, 3 is not covered.So, 3 is missing. So, need to include 3 or another number.If I include 3, S = {1, 3, 4, 5, 10}.Now, check:3: in S.4: in S.5: in S.6: 1 + 5.7: 3 + 4.8: 4 + 4.9: 4 + 5.10: in S.11: 1 + 10.12: 5 + 7, but 7 is not in S. Alternatively, 10 + 2, but 2 is not in S. So, 12 is missing.So, 12 is not covered. So, need to include another number.If I include 7, S = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10}.Now, 12: 5 + 7.13: 3 + 10.14: 7 + 7.15: 5 + 10.16: 10 + 6, but 6 is not in S. Alternatively, 7 + 9, but 9 is not in S. So, 16 is missing.So, need to include another number.If I include 6, S = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10}.Now, 16: 6 + 10.17: 7 + 10.18: 9 + 9, but 9 is not in S. Alternatively, 10 + 8, but 8 is not in S. So, 18 is missing.So, need to include 8 or 9.If I include 8, S becomes {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}, size 8. That's worse.Alternatively, include 9: same problem.This approach seems to be leading to a larger set.So, perhaps the initial approach with S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10} is better, as it only requires 6 numbers.Wait, let me see if I can find another set with 6 numbers that might cover all.What if I include 2 instead of 3? Let's try S = {1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10}.Check coverage:1: in S.2: in S.3: 1 + 2.4: 2 + 2.5: in S.6: 1 + 5.7: in S.8: 3 + 5, but 3 is not in S. Alternatively, 1 + 7.Wait, 1 + 7 = 8, which is covered.9: in S.10: in S.11: 1 + 10.12: 3 + 9, but 3 is not in S. Alternatively, 5 + 7.5 + 7 = 12, which is covered.13: 5 + 8, but 8 is not in S.

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.Starting with the first part: finding ( a_0 ). I know that ( a_0 ) is the constant term in the expansion, which means it's the term without any ( x ). Each term in the sum is ( (1+x)^k ) where ( k ) ranges from 1 to ( n ). So, if I expand each ( (1+x)^k ), the constant term in each expansion is 1, right? Because ( (1+x)^k ) when expanded starts with 1, then ( kx ), then ( frac{k(k-1)}{2}x^2 ), and so on.So, if I add up all these constant terms from each ( (1+x)^k ), I'm essentially adding 1 a total of ( n ) times. That means ( a_0 = 1 + 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 ) (n times). Therefore, ( a_0 = n ). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Each ( (1+x)^k ) contributes 1 to the constant term, and there are ( n ) such terms from ( k=1 ) to ( k=n ). So yes, ( a_0 = n ). That seems straightforward.Now, moving on to the second part: if ( a_3 = 35 ), then find ( n ). Hmm, okay. ( a_3 ) is the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in the expansion of the given sum. So, I need to find the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in each ( (1+x)^k ) term and then sum them up from ( k=1 ) to ( k=n ).I remember that the coefficient of ( x^m ) in ( (1+x)^k ) is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{k}{m} ). So, in this case, the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in ( (1+x)^k ) is ( binom{k}{3} ). Therefore, the total coefficient ( a_3 ) is the sum of ( binom{k}{3} ) from ( k=1 ) to ( k=n ).So, ( a_3 = sum_{k=1}^{n} binom{k}{3} ). Hmm, I need to compute this sum. I recall that there's a formula for the sum of binomial coefficients. Specifically, the sum ( sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{k}{m} = binom{n+1}{m+1} ). Wait, is that correct? Let me verify.Yes, I think that's the hockey-stick identity or something similar. So, if we have ( sum_{k=m}^{n} binom{k}{m} = binom{n+1}{m+1} ). In our case, ( m = 3 ), so the sum ( sum_{k=3}^{n} binom{k}{3} = binom{n+1}{4} ). But wait, in our original sum, ( k ) starts from 1. However, ( binom{k}{3} ) is zero when ( k < 3 ). So, effectively, the sum from ( k=1 ) to ( n ) is the same as the sum from ( k=3 ) to ( n ).Therefore, ( a_3 = sum_{k=1}^{n} binom{k}{3} = sum_{k=3}^{n} binom{k}{3} = binom{n+1}{4} ). So, ( a_3 = binom{n+1}{4} ). Given that ( a_3 = 35 ), we have:[binom{n+1}{4} = 35]Now, I need to solve for ( n ). Let me recall that ( binom{n+1}{4} = frac{(n+1)n(n-1)(n-2)}{24} ). So, setting this equal to 35:[frac{(n+1)n(n-1)(n-2)}{24} = 35]Multiplying both sides by 24:[(n+1)n(n-1)(n-2) = 35 times 24]Calculating 35 multiplied by 24: 35*24. Let me compute that. 35*20=700, 35*4=140, so 700+140=840. So, the equation becomes:[(n+1)n(n-1)(n-2) = 840]Hmm, so I need to find an integer ( n ) such that the product of four consecutive integers starting from ( n-2 ) up to ( n+1 ) is 840. Let me factorize 840 to see what possible integers could multiply to this.First, prime factorization of 840:840 ÷ 2 = 420420 ÷ 2 = 210210 ÷ 2 = 105105 ÷ 3 = 3535 ÷ 5 = 77 ÷ 7 = 1So, prime factors are 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7.Now, let's think about four consecutive integers whose product is 840. Let me try to find such integers.Let me denote the four consecutive integers as ( k, k+1, k+2, k+3 ). Wait, but in our case, the four consecutive integers are ( n-2, n-1, n, n+1 ). So, it's four consecutive integers centered around n.Alternatively, maybe it's easier to list the factors of 840 and see which four consecutive numbers multiply to it.Let me list the factors of 840:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 24, 28, 30, 35, 40, 42, 56, 60, 70, 84, 105, 120, 140, 168, 210, 280, 420, 840.Looking for four consecutive integers in this list whose product is 840.Let me try starting from smaller numbers:Check 4,5,6,7: 4*5=20, 20*6=120, 120*7=840. Oh! Wait, 4*5*6*7=840. So, that's four consecutive integers: 4,5,6,7.Therefore, ( n-2 = 4 ), so ( n = 6 ). Let me check:If ( n = 6 ), then ( n-2 = 4 ), ( n-1 = 5 ), ( n = 6 ), ( n+1 = 7 ). So, 4*5*6*7=840, which is correct.Therefore, ( n = 6 ).Wait, let me double-check to make sure. If ( n = 6 ), then ( a_3 = binom{6+1}{4} = binom{7}{4} ). Calculating ( binom{7}{4} ), which is 35. Yes, that's correct because ( binom{7}{4} = frac{7!}{4!3!} = 35 ). So, that's consistent.Therefore, the value of ( n ) is 6.So, summarizing my findings:1. ( a_0 = n )2. When ( a_3 = 35 ), ( n = 6 )I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was recognizing the sum of binomial coefficients and applying the identity to simplify the expression. Then, factoring 840 helped me find the consecutive integers, which led me to the value of ( n ).**Final Answer**The value of ( a_0 ) is boxed{n} and the value of ( n ) is boxed{6}."},{"question":"What is the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3?","answer":"To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, I start by identifying the common multiples of 3 and 5, since 15 is the least common multiple of these two numbers.

Finally, I count to the tenth number in this sequence, which is 285."},{"question":"In the expansion of ({1+frac{1}{{{x^3}}}}){({1+x})^7}, the coefficient of x^{3} is ____.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in the expansion of ( left(1 + frac{1}{x^3}right)(1 + x)^7 ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when you have a product of two expressions, you can expand them using the distributive property. So, in this case, I can distribute ( left(1 + frac{1}{x^3}right) ) over ( (1 + x)^7 ). That means I'll have two separate terms: one where I multiply 1 by ( (1 + x)^7 ) and another where I multiply ( frac{1}{x^3} ) by ( (1 + x)^7 ).So, the expression becomes:[left(1 times (1 + x)^7right) + left(frac{1}{x^3} times (1 + x)^7right)]Which simplifies to:[(1 + x)^7 + frac{(1 + x)^7}{x^3}]Alright, so now I need to find the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in this entire expression. That means I have to find the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in each part separately and then add them together.Let me start with the first part: ( (1 + x)^7 ). I know that the expansion of ( (1 + x)^n ) is given by the binomial theorem, which states:[(1 + x)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^k]So, for ( n = 7 ), the expansion is:[(1 + x)^7 = sum_{k=0}^{7} binom{7}{k} x^k]I need the coefficient of ( x^3 ) here, which is ( binom{7}{3} ). Let me compute that:[binom{7}{3} = frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = frac{7 times 6 times 5}{3 times 2 times 1} = 35]So, the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in ( (1 + x)^7 ) is 35.Now, moving on to the second part: ( frac{(1 + x)^7}{x^3} ). This can be rewritten as ( x^{-3}(1 + x)^7 ). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of ( (1 + x)^7 ) will be multiplied by ( x^{-3} ).Let me write that out:[x^{-3}(1 + x)^7 = x^{-3} times sum_{k=0}^{7} binom{7}{k} x^k = sum_{k=0}^{7} binom{7}{k} x^{k - 3}]So, each term is ( binom{7}{k} x^{k - 3} ). I need the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in this expression. That means I need to find the value of ( k ) such that ( k - 3 = 3 ). Solving for ( k ), we get ( k = 6 ).Therefore, the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in ( x^{-3}(1 + x)^7 ) is ( binom{7}{6} ). Let's compute that:[binom{7}{6} = frac{7!}{6!(7-6)!} = frac{7}{1} = 7]So, the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in the second part is 7.Now, to find the total coefficient of ( x^3 ) in the original expression, I need to add the coefficients from both parts together. That is:[35 + 7 = 42]Therefore, the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in the expansion is 42.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding ( (1 + x)^7 ) gives a term with ( x^3 ) whose coefficient is 35. Then, when I multiply ( (1 + x)^7 ) by ( x^{-3} ), the term that will contribute to ( x^3 ) is the term with ( x^6 ) in the original expansion, which is ( binom{7}{6} = 7 ). Adding them together gives 35 + 7 = 42. That seems correct.I think I got it right. So, the coefficient is 42.**Final Answer**The coefficient of ( x^3 ) is boxed{42}."},{"question":"Let M Theta N represent the remainder when the larger of M and N is divided by the smaller one. For example, 3 Theta 10 = 1. For non-zero natural numbers A less than 40, given that 20 Theta(A bigodot 20) = 7, find A.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find a natural number A less than 40. The condition given is that 20 Θ (A ⊙ 20) equals 7. Hmm, let me try to understand what these operations mean.First, the problem defines M Θ N as the remainder when the larger of M and N is divided by the smaller one. So, for example, 3 Θ 10 is 1 because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1. Got it. So Θ is essentially the modulo operation, but it takes the larger number modulo the smaller one.Now, the other operation is A ⊙ 20. I don't know what ⊙ represents here. The problem doesn't define it, so maybe it's a typo or something. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: \\"Let M Θ N represent the remainder when the larger of M and N is divided by the smaller one. For example, 3 Θ 10 = 1. For non-zero natural numbers A less than 40, given that 20 Θ(A ⊙ 20) = 7, find A.\\"Hmm, maybe ⊙ is a typo for Θ? Or perhaps it's another operation. Wait, in the example, it's 3 Θ 10, so maybe ⊙ is supposed to be multiplication? Because if it's A multiplied by 20, then A ⊙ 20 would be 20A. But let me check.Wait, if A is less than 40, then 20A would be less than 800. But 20 Θ (20A) would be the remainder when the larger of 20 and 20A is divided by the smaller. Since 20A is larger than 20 (as A is at least 1), it would be 20A mod 20, which is 0. But the problem says it's 7. So that can't be.Alternatively, maybe ⊙ is addition? So A ⊙ 20 would be A + 20. Let's test that. If A is less than 40, then A + 20 is less than 60. Then 20 Θ (A + 20) would be the remainder when the larger of 20 and (A + 20) is divided by the smaller. Since A is at least 1, A + 20 is at least 21, which is larger than 20. So it would be (A + 20) mod 20, which is equal to A mod 20. And this is supposed to be 7. So A mod 20 = 7. Therefore, A could be 7, 27, 47, etc. But since A is less than 40, possible values are 7 and 27.Wait, but let me think again. If A is 7, then A + 20 is 27. Then 20 Θ 27 is 27 mod 20, which is 7. That works. If A is 27, then A + 20 is 47. Then 20 Θ 47 is 47 mod 20, which is 7. That also works. So A could be 7 or 27.But wait, the problem says \\"non-zero natural numbers A less than 40.\\" So both 7 and 27 are valid. But the problem asks to \\"find A,\\" which suggests there might be a unique solution. Maybe I made a wrong assumption about the operation ⊙.Alternatively, maybe ⊙ is subtraction? So A ⊙ 20 would be A - 20. But if A is less than 40, A - 20 could be negative or positive. If A is less than 20, then A - 20 is negative, and the larger of 20 and (A - 20) would be 20, so 20 mod (A - 20) is undefined because you can't divide by a negative number or zero. So that doesn't make sense. If A is greater than 20, say 21, then A - 20 is 1, so 20 Θ 1 is 20 mod 1, which is 0. But we need 7, so that doesn't work either. So subtraction is probably not the operation.Hmm, maybe ⊙ is division? So A ⊙ 20 is A divided by 20. But A is less than 40, so A/20 is less than 2. If A is 20, then 20/20 is 1. Then 20 Θ 1 is 20 mod 1, which is 0. Not 7. If A is 21, 21/20 is 1.05, but we're dealing with natural numbers, so maybe it's integer division? 21 divided by 20 is 1 with a remainder, but I don't think that's the case here. So probably not division.Wait, maybe ⊙ is the greatest common divisor (GCD) or least common multiple (LCM). Let me think. If ⊙ is GCD, then A ⊙ 20 is GCD(A, 20). Then 20 Θ GCD(A, 20) would be the remainder when the larger of 20 and GCD(A,20) is divided by the smaller. Since GCD(A,20) is a divisor of 20, it's less than or equal to 20. So the larger number is 20, and we compute 20 mod GCD(A,20). This should equal 7.So, 20 mod d = 7, where d is GCD(A,20). So 20 mod d = 7 implies that d divides (20 - 7) = 13. Since 13 is prime, the divisors are 1 and 13. But d must be a divisor of 20 as well. The divisors of 20 are 1,2,4,5,10,20. So the common divisors are only 1. Therefore, d=1. So GCD(A,20)=1. Therefore, A must be coprime with 20. So A can be any number less than 40 that is coprime with 20. But the problem says \\"find A,\\" implying a unique solution. So maybe I'm missing something.Wait, but if d=1, then 20 mod 1 is 0, not 7. So that doesn't work. So maybe my assumption that ⊙ is GCD is wrong.Alternatively, if ⊙ is LCM, then A ⊙ 20 is LCM(A,20). Then 20 Θ LCM(A,20) is the remainder when the larger of 20 and LCM(A,20) is divided by the smaller. Since LCM(A,20) is at least 20, it's the larger number. So we compute LCM(A,20) mod 20. This should be 7.So LCM(A,20) mod 20 = 7. Let's denote LCM(A,20) as L. Then L mod 20 =7, so L =20k +7 for some integer k. But L must be a multiple of 20 and A. Wait, but L is a multiple of 20, so L must be 20 times something. But 20k +7 is not a multiple of 20 unless 7 is a multiple of 20, which it's not. So that's impossible. Therefore, LCM can't be the operation either.Hmm, maybe I need to consider that ⊙ is another operation, perhaps multiplication. Wait, earlier I thought that if ⊙ is multiplication, then 20A mod 20 would be 0, but the result is 7. So that can't be. Unless I'm misunderstanding the operation.Wait, maybe the operation is something else. Let me think again. The problem says \\"20 Θ (A ⊙ 20) =7\\". So first compute A ⊙ 20, then take 20 Θ that result.If ⊙ is multiplication, then A ⊙20 is 20A. Then 20 Θ20A is the remainder when the larger of 20 and 20A is divided by the smaller. Since 20A is larger than 20 (as A is at least 1), it's 20A mod 20, which is 0. But we need 7, so that's not possible.If ⊙ is addition, then A ⊙20 is A+20. Then 20 Θ (A+20) is (A+20) mod 20, which is A mod 20. So A mod 20 =7, so A=7,27,47,... But since A is less than 40, possible A are 7 and 27.But the problem says \\"find A,\\" implying a unique solution, so maybe both are acceptable? Or perhaps I need to consider that A must be such that A+20 is larger than 20, which it is, so both 7 and 27 are valid. But the problem might expect the smallest such A, which is 7. Alternatively, maybe there's another operation.Wait, perhaps ⊙ is subtraction, but as I thought earlier, that leads to issues. Alternatively, maybe it's exponentiation? So A ⊙20 is A^20. Then 20 Θ (A^20) would be the remainder when the larger of 20 and A^20 is divided by the smaller. Since A is less than 40, A^20 is a huge number, so 20 Θ (A^20) would be A^20 mod 20. We need this to be 7.So A^20 mod 20 =7. Let's see. Euler's theorem says that if A and 20 are coprime, then A^φ(20) ≡1 mod 20, where φ(20)=8. So A^8 ≡1 mod 20, so A^20 = (A^8)^2 * A^4 ≡1^2 * A^4 ≡A^4 mod 20. So we need A^4 ≡7 mod 20.Let me check possible A values less than 40 and coprime with 20 (since otherwise Euler's theorem doesn't apply). The numbers coprime with 20 less than 40 are 1,3,7,9,11,13,17,19,21,23,27,29,31,33,37,39.Let me compute A^4 mod 20 for these:A=1: 1^4=1 mod20=1≠7A=3: 3^4=81 mod20=1≠7A=7:7^4=2401 mod20=1≠7A=9:9^4=6561 mod20=1≠7A=11:11^4=14641 mod20=1≠7A=13:13^4=28561 mod20=1≠7A=17:17^4=83521 mod20=1≠7A=19:19^4=130321 mod20=1≠7A=21:21^4=194481 mod20=1≠7A=23:23^4=279841 mod20=1≠7A=27:27^4=531441 mod20=1≠7A=29:29^4=707281 mod20=1≠7A=31:31^4=923521 mod20=1≠7A=33:33^4=1185921 mod20=1≠7A=37:37^4=1874161 mod20=1≠7A=39:39^4=2313441 mod20=1≠7Hmm, all these A^4 mod20 are 1, not 7. So that's not working. Therefore, exponentiation is probably not the operation.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The problem says \\"20 Θ (A ⊙ 20) =7\\". If ⊙ is addition, then A+20, and 20 Θ (A+20)= (A+20) mod20= A mod20=7. So A=7,27. Since A<40, possible A=7,27.But the problem says \\"find A,\\" so maybe both are acceptable? Or perhaps I need to consider that A must be such that A+20 is larger than 20, which it is, so both are valid. But maybe the problem expects the smallest such A, which is 7.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that A is such that A+20 is larger than 20, which it is, but also that A+20 is not a multiple of 20, which it isn't because A mod20=7≠0.Wait, but let me check if A=7 works. A=7, then A+20=27. Then 20 Θ27=27 mod20=7. Yes, that works. Similarly, A=27: 27+20=47. 20 Θ47=47 mod20=7. That also works.So both A=7 and A=27 satisfy the condition. But the problem says \\"find A\\" without specifying further constraints. Maybe I need to list all possible A. But the problem says \\"find A,\\" so perhaps it's expecting the smallest such A, which is 7.Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something about the operation ⊙. Maybe it's not addition but something else. Let me think again.Wait, the problem defines Θ as the remainder when the larger is divided by the smaller. So if ⊙ is another operation, perhaps it's a typo for Θ? Let me check: If it's 20 Θ (A Θ20)=7. Let's see.If ⊙ is Θ, then A Θ20 is the remainder when the larger of A and 20 is divided by the smaller. So if A>20, then A Θ20= A mod20. If A<20, then A Θ20=20 modA.So 20 Θ (A Θ20)=7. Let's consider two cases:Case 1: A>20. Then A Θ20= A mod20. Let's denote this as R. So 20 Θ R=7. Since R is less than 20, 20 Θ R=20 mod R=7. So 20 mod R=7. Therefore, R=20-7=13. So A mod20=13. Therefore, A=20k+13. Since A<40, possible A=13,33. But A>20 in this case, so A=33.Case 2: A<20. Then A Θ20=20 modA. Let's denote this as R. So 20 Θ R=7. Since R is the remainder when 20 is divided by A, R< A. So 20 Θ R=20 mod R=7. Therefore, R=20-7=13. But R must be less than A, so A>13. But in this case, A<20. So A must be greater than 13 and less than 20. So A can be 14,15,16,17,18,19.But R=20 modA=13. So 20 modA=13 implies that A divides (20-13)=7. So A must be a divisor of 7. The divisors of 7 are 1 and7. But A must be greater than13, which is not possible. Therefore, no solution in this case.Therefore, the only solution is A=33.Wait, so if ⊙ is Θ, then A=33. But earlier, if ⊙ is addition, A=7 or27. So which one is it?The problem didn't define ⊙, so maybe it's a typo. The original problem says \\"20 Θ(A ⊙ 20) =7\\". Maybe the intended operation is addition, so A+20. Then A=7 or27. But if it's Θ, then A=33.But since the problem didn't define ⊙, I think it's more likely that it's a typo and should be addition, so A+20. Therefore, A=7 or27.But the problem says \\"find A,\\" and in the example, it's 3 Θ10=1, which is 10 mod3=1. So maybe the operation is similar to Θ, but in the problem, it's written as ⊙. Maybe it's a different operation, but since it's not defined, perhaps it's a typo.Alternatively, maybe ⊙ is multiplication, but as I saw earlier, that leads to 0, which doesn't work. So perhaps it's addition.Given that, I think the answer is A=7 or27. But since the problem says \\"find A,\\" maybe it's expecting the smallest such A, which is7.Wait, but let me check again. If A=7, then A+20=27. 20 Θ27=27 mod20=7. Correct.If A=27, then A+20=47. 20 Θ47=47 mod20=7. Correct.So both are valid. But the problem says \\"find A,\\" so maybe both are acceptable. But since it's asking for a single answer, perhaps the smallest one, which is7.Alternatively, maybe the operation is multiplication, but as I saw earlier, that doesn't work. So I think the answer is A=7 or27. But since the problem says \\"find A,\\" maybe it's expecting both. But the problem might have intended addition, so I think the answer is7.Wait, but let me think again. If ⊙ is multiplication, then 20A mod20=0≠7, so that's not possible. If ⊙ is addition, then A+20 mod20=7, so A=7,27. If ⊙ is Θ, then A=33.But since the problem didn't define ⊙, I think the most plausible is addition, so A=7 or27. But since the problem says \\"find A,\\" maybe it's expecting the smallest, which is7.Alternatively, maybe the operation is subtraction, but as I saw earlier, that leads to issues. So I think the answer is7.Wait, but let me check the problem again. It says \\"non-zero natural numbers A less than 40.\\" So A can be from1 to39. If A=7, then A+20=27, and 20 Θ27=7. Correct. If A=27, A+20=47, and 20 Θ47=7. Correct. So both are valid. But the problem says \\"find A,\\" so maybe both are acceptable. But since it's a single answer, perhaps the smallest one, which is7.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects multiple answers, but since it's a single box, maybe it's7.Wait, but let me think again. If ⊙ is multiplication, then 20A mod20=0, which is not7. So that's out. If ⊙ is addition, then A=7,27. If ⊙ is Θ, then A=33. But since ⊙ is undefined, I think the most plausible is addition, so A=7 or27.But the problem says \\"find A,\\" so maybe it's expecting both. But since it's a single answer, perhaps the smallest one, which is7.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects A=27 because A must be such that A+20>20, but that's always true. So both are valid.Wait, but let me think about the definition of Θ. It says \\"the remainder when the larger of M and N is divided by the smaller one.\\" So for example, 3 Θ10=1 because10>3, so10 mod3=1.So if we have 20 Θ (A ⊙20)=7, then the larger of20 and (A ⊙20) divided by the smaller gives a remainder of7.If ⊙ is addition, then (A+20) is larger than20, so (A+20) mod20=7, so A mod20=7, so A=7,27.If ⊙ is multiplication, then 20A is larger than20, so20A mod20=0≠7.If ⊙ is Θ, then A Θ20 is the remainder when larger ofA and20 is divided by the smaller. So if A>20, then A mod20. Then 20 Θ(A mod20)=7. So 20 mod(A mod20)=7. Let me denote R=A mod20. So 20 modR=7. Therefore, R=20-7=13. So A mod20=13, so A=13,33. But since A>20 in this case, A=33.If A<20, then A Θ20=20 modA. Let R=20 modA. Then 20 ΘR=7. So 20 modR=7. Therefore, R=20-7=13. But R=20 modA=13, so A must divide (20-13)=7. So A=7. But A<20, so A=7.Wait, so if ⊙ is Θ, then A can be7 or33. But earlier, if ⊙ is addition, A=7 or27.But the problem didn't define ⊙, so it's ambiguous. However, since the problem uses Θ as a custom operation, maybe ⊙ is also a custom operation, but it's not defined. So perhaps it's a typo and should be Θ, making A=7 or33.But in the problem, it's written as \\"20 Θ(A ⊙20)=7\\". If ⊙ is Θ, then it's 20 Θ(A Θ20)=7. So let's solve that.Case1: A>20. Then A Θ20=A mod20=R. Then 20 ΘR=7. Since R<20, 20 modR=7. So R=20-7=13. Therefore, A mod20=13, so A=13,33. But since A>20, A=33.Case2: A<20. Then A Θ20=20 modA=R. Then 20 ΘR=7. So 20 modR=7. Therefore, R=20-7=13. But R=20 modA=13, so A must divide (20-13)=7. Therefore, A=7.So if ⊙ is Θ, then A=7 or33.But the problem didn't define ⊙, so it's unclear. However, since the problem uses Θ as a custom operation, maybe ⊙ is also a custom operation, but it's not defined. So perhaps it's a typo and should be Θ, making A=7 or33.But the problem says \\"find A,\\" so maybe it's expecting both. But since it's a single answer, perhaps the smallest one, which is7.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects A=33 because it's the only one when A>20.But without knowing what ⊙ is, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem uses Θ, and ⊙ is undefined, I think the most plausible is that it's a typo and should be Θ, making A=7 or33.But since the problem says \\"find A,\\" and it's less than40, both7 and33 are valid. But maybe the answer is7.Wait, but let me think again. If ⊙ is Θ, then A=7 or33. If ⊙ is addition, then A=7 or27. But since the problem didn't define ⊙, I think it's safer to assume that it's a typo and should be Θ, making A=7 or33.But the problem says \\"find A,\\" so maybe both are acceptable. But since it's a single answer, perhaps the smallest one, which is7.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects A=27 because when A=27, A+20=47, and 47 mod20=7.But I'm getting confused because the operation is undefined. I think the safest assumption is that ⊙ is addition, so A=7 or27. But since the problem says \\"find A,\\" maybe it's expecting the smallest one, which is7.Wait, but let me check the problem again. It says \\"non-zero natural numbers A less than40.\\" So A can be from1 to39. If A=7, then A+20=27, and 20 Θ27=7. Correct. If A=27, then A+20=47, and 20 Θ47=7. Correct. So both are valid.But the problem says \\"find A,\\" so maybe both are acceptable. But since it's a single answer, perhaps the smallest one, which is7.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects A=27 because when A=27, A+20=47, and 47 mod20=7. But I'm not sure.Wait, but let me think about the definition of Θ again. It's the remainder when the larger is divided by the smaller. So for 20 Θ (A+20), since A+20>20, it's (A+20) mod20=7. So A mod20=7. Therefore, A=7,27.So I think the answer is7 or27. But since the problem says \\"find A,\\" maybe it's expecting the smallest one, which is7.But to be thorough, let me check both:A=7: 7+20=27. 20 Θ27=27 mod20=7. Correct.A=27:27+20=47. 20 Θ47=47 mod20=7. Correct.So both are valid. But since the problem says \\"find A,\\" maybe it's expecting both. But since it's a single answer, perhaps the smallest one, which is7.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects A=27 because it's the only one when A>20. But I'm not sure.Wait, but let me think again. If A=7, then A+20=27, which is less than40+20=60, but the problem only restricts A<40, not A+20. So both are valid.I think the answer is7 or27. But since the problem says \\"find A,\\" maybe it's expecting the smallest one, which is7.But to be safe, I think the answer is7."},{"question":"Zan has created this iterative rule for generating sequences of whole numbers:1) If a number is 25 or less, double the number.2) If a number is greater than 25, subtract 12 from it.Let F be the first number in a sequence generated by the rule above. F is a \\"sweet number\\" if 16 is not a term in the sequence that starts with F. How many of the whole numbers 1 through 50 are \\"sweet numbers\\"?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many numbers from 1 to 50 are \\"sweet numbers\\" based on Zan's iterative rule. A \\"sweet number\\" is defined as a starting number F where 16 does not appear in the sequence generated by Zan's rules. First, let me make sure I understand the rules correctly:1) If a number is 25 or less, double it.2) If a number is greater than 25, subtract 12 from it.So, starting with any number F, we apply these rules repeatedly to generate a sequence. If 16 ever shows up in that sequence, then F is not a sweet number. If 16 never shows up, then F is sweet. My task is to count how many such sweet numbers exist between 1 and 50.Hmm, okay. Maybe I should approach this by first understanding what sequences look like starting from different numbers. Perhaps I can find cycles or patterns in the sequences, which might help me determine whether 16 appears or not.Let me start by considering what happens when we start with 16. If I start with 16, then according to rule 1, since 16 is less than or equal to 25, I double it: 16 * 2 = 32. Now, 32 is greater than 25, so I subtract 12: 32 - 12 = 20. 20 is less than or equal to 25, so I double it: 20 * 2 = 40. 40 is greater than 25, so subtract 12: 40 - 12 = 28. 28 is still greater than 25, so subtract 12 again: 28 - 12 = 16. Oh, so we're back to 16. So starting from 16, the sequence cycles between 16, 32, 20, 40, 28, and back to 16. So 16 is part of a cycle.Therefore, any number that eventually leads into this cycle will have 16 in its sequence. So, to find sweet numbers, we need numbers that do not lead into this cycle. Alternatively, numbers that either lead to another cycle or diverge in some way without ever reaching 16.So, perhaps if I can find all numbers that eventually reach 16, those are the non-sweet numbers, and the rest are sweet. Therefore, the number of sweet numbers would be 50 minus the number of non-sweet numbers.Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a graph where each number points to its next number according to the rules, and then identify all numbers that can reach 16. The sweet numbers would be those that cannot reach 16.Let me try to formalize this a bit. For each number F from 1 to 50, I can generate its sequence until it either reaches 16 or enters another cycle. If it reaches 16, then F is not sweet. If it doesn't, then F is sweet.But doing this manually for each number from 1 to 50 would be tedious. Maybe I can find a pattern or some properties that can help me categorize numbers more efficiently.First, let's consider the cycle that includes 16: 16 → 32 → 20 → 40 → 28 → 16. So, numbers in this cycle are 16, 20, 28, 32, 40. These are definitely non-sweet numbers because starting from them, 16 is in the sequence.Now, let's see if there are other cycles. Let me pick a number not in the above cycle and see where it goes.Let's take 1. Starting with 1:1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16. Oh, so 1 leads to 16. Therefore, 1 is a non-sweet number.Similarly, 2: 2 → 4 → 8 → 16. So 2 is non-sweet.3: 3 → 6 → 12 → 24 → 48. 48 is greater than 25, so subtract 12: 48 -12=36. 36>25, subtract 12: 36-12=24. Now, 24 is ≤25, so double it: 24*2=48. So, we have a cycle here: 24 →48→36→24. So, starting from 3, we reach 24, which is part of another cycle. So, 3 does not reach 16. Therefore, 3 is a sweet number.Wait, so 3 is sweet. Interesting. So, not all numbers lead to 16. Some lead to other cycles.Let me check another number, say 5.5: 5→10→20. 20 is in the 16 cycle, so 5 is non-sweet.6: 6→12→24→48→36→24... So, same as 3, 6 leads to 24, which is in another cycle. So, 6 is sweet.Wait, but earlier, 3 leads to 24, which is in a different cycle, so 3 is sweet. Similarly, 6 is sweet.Wait, but 5 leads to 20, which is in the 16 cycle, so 5 is non-sweet.Similarly, 7: 7→14→28. 28 is in the 16 cycle, so 7 is non-sweet.8: 8→16, so 8 is non-sweet.9: 9→18→36. 36 is in the 24 cycle, so 9 is sweet.10: 10→20, which is in the 16 cycle, so 10 is non-sweet.11: 11→22→44. 44>25, subtract 12: 44-12=32. 32 is in the 16 cycle, so 11 is non-sweet.12: 12→24, which is in the 24 cycle, so 12 is sweet.13: 13→26. 26>25, subtract 12: 26-12=14. 14→28, which is in the 16 cycle, so 13 is non-sweet.14: 14→28, which is in the 16 cycle, so 14 is non-sweet.15: 15→30. 30>25, subtract 12: 30-12=18. 18→36, which is in the 24 cycle, so 15 is sweet.16: As before, it's in the 16 cycle, so non-sweet.17: 17→34. 34>25, subtract 12: 34-12=22. 22→44. 44>25, subtract 12: 44-12=32. 32 is in the 16 cycle, so 17 is non-sweet.18: 18→36, which is in the 24 cycle, so 18 is sweet.19: 19→38. 38>25, subtract 12: 38-12=26. 26>25, subtract 12: 26-12=14. 14→28, which is in the 16 cycle, so 19 is non-sweet.20: In the 16 cycle, non-sweet.21: 21→42. 42>25, subtract 12: 42-12=30. 30>25, subtract 12: 30-12=18. 18→36, which is in the 24 cycle, so 21 is sweet.22: 22→44. 44>25, subtract 12: 44-12=32. 32 is in the 16 cycle, so 22 is non-sweet.23: 23→46. 46>25, subtract 12: 46-12=34. 34>25, subtract 12: 34-12=22. 22→44→32, which is in the 16 cycle, so 23 is non-sweet.24: In the 24 cycle, so sweet.25: 25→50. 50>25, subtract 12: 50-12=38. 38>25, subtract 12: 38-12=26. 26>25, subtract 12: 26-12=14. 14→28, which is in the 16 cycle, so 25 is non-sweet.26: 26→14→28, which is in the 16 cycle, so 26 is non-sweet.27: 27→54. Wait, but we're only considering numbers up to 50. Hmm, does the rule apply beyond 50? The problem says F is a whole number from 1 to 50, but the sequence can go beyond 50.

For example, number 7: leads to 14→28, which is in the 16 cycle, so 7 is non-sweet. Similarly, number 4: 4→8→16, so non-sweet.Number 5: leads to 10→20, which is in the 16 cycle, so non-sweet.Number 10: leads to 20, non-sweet.Number 11: leads to 22→44→32, which is in the 16 cycle, so non-sweet.Number 13: leads to 14→28, non-sweet.Number 14: leads to 28, non-sweet.Number 17: leads to 22→44→32, non-sweet.Number 19: leads to 26→14→28, non-sweet.Number 23: leads to 22→44→32, non-sweet.Number 25: leads to 38→26→14→28, non-sweet.Number 26: leads to 14→28, non-sweet.Number 28: cycle, non-sweet.Number 29: leads to 22→44→32, non-sweet.Number 31: leads to 38→26→14→28, non-sweet.Number 32: cycle, non-sweet.Number 34: leads to 22→44→32, non-sweet.Number 35: leads to 34→22→44→32, non-sweet.Number 37: leads to 38→26→14→28, non-sweet.Number 38: leads to 26→14→28, non-sweet.Number 40: cycle, non-sweet.Number 41: leads to 34→22→44→32, non-sweet.Number 43: leads to 34→22→44→32, non-sweet.Number 44: leads to 32, non-sweet.Number 46: leads to 34→22→44→32, non-sweet.Number 47: leads to 34→22→44→32, non-sweet.Number 49: leads to 38→26→14→28, non-sweet.Number 50: leads to 38→26→14→28, non-sweet.So, indeed, only the 16 numbers I listed earlier are sweet.Wait, but let me check if I missed any numbers between 1 and 50.Wait, 16 numbers seem a bit low. Let me recount:3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48.Yes, that's 16 numbers.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that some numbers might not lead to either the 16 cycle or the 24 cycle? For example, could there be another cycle?Let me check number 1: 1→2→4→8→16, so it leads to the 16 cycle.Number 2: 2→4→8→16, same.Number 4: 4→8→16.Number 5: 5→10→20→32→16.Number 7: 7→14→28→16.Number 10: 10→20→32→16.Number 11: 11→22→44→32→16.Number 13: 13→26→14→28→16.Number 14: 14→28→16.Number 17: 17→34→22→44→32→16.Number 19: 19→38→26→14→28→16.Number 22: 22→44→32→16.Number 23: 23→46→34→22→44→32→16.Number 25: 25→50→38→26→14→28→16.Number 26: 26→14→28→16.Number 28: 28→16.Number 29: 29→58→46→34→22→44→32→16.Number 31: 31→62→50→38→26→14→28→16.Number 32: 32→16.Number 34: 34→22→44→32→16.Number 35: 35→70→58→46→34→22→44→32→16.Number 37: 37→74→62→50→38→26→14→28→16.Number 38: 38→26→14→28→16.Number 40: 40→28→16.Number 41: 41→82→70→58→46→34→22→44→32→16.Number 43: 43→86→74→62→50→38→26→14→28→16.Number 44: 44→32→16.Number 46: 46→34→22→44→32→16.Number 47: 47→86→74→62→50→38→26→14→28→16.Number 49: 49→98→86→74→62→50→38→26→14→28→16.Number 50: 50→38→26→14→28→16.So, all numbers except those in the 24 cycle lead to the 16 cycle. Therefore, the only sweet numbers are those in the 24 cycle and those that lead into it without passing through 16.Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I found 16 sweet numbers. Let me confirm if that's correct.Wait, the 24 cycle includes 24, 36, 48. So, those are three numbers. Then, numbers that lead into the 24 cycle are:3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48.Wait, but 24,36,48 are already in the cycle, so the numbers leading into it are the others: 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,27,30,33,39,42,45. That's 13 numbers, plus the 3 in the cycle, totaling 16.Yes, that's correct. So, 16 sweet numbers.Wait, but let me think again. Is 24,36,48 the only numbers in the 24 cycle? Let me confirm:Starting from 24: 24→48→36→24. So, yes, the cycle is 24,48,36,24,...So, 24,36,48 are the only numbers in that cycle.Therefore, the sweet numbers are:3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48.Total of 16 numbers.Wait, but let me check if any of these numbers might actually lead to 16. For example, 3: 3→6→12→24→48→36→24... So, it cycles without hitting 16. Similarly, 6→12→24→48→36→24... So, yes, they don't reach 16.Similarly, 9→18→36→24... So, no 16.12→24→48→36→24... No 16.15→30→18→36→24... No 16.18→36→24... No 16.21→42→30→18→36→24... No 16.24 is in the cycle.27→54→42→30→18→36→24... No 16.30→18→36→24... No 16.33→66→54→42→30→18→36→24... No 16.36 is in the cycle.39→78→66→54→42→30→18→36→24... No 16.42→30→18→36→24... No 16.45→90→78→66→54→42→30→18→36→24... No 16.48 is in the cycle.So, yes, none of these 16 numbers lead to 16. Therefore, they are all sweet.Therefore, the number of sweet numbers from 1 to 50 is 16.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any numbers. For example, number 1: leads to 16, so non-sweet.Number 2: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 4: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 5: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 7: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 8: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 10: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 11: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 13: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 14: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 16: in the cycle, non-sweet.Number 17: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 19: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 20: in the cycle, non-sweet.Number 22: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 23: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 25: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 26: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 28: in the cycle, non-sweet.Number 29: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 31: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 32: in the cycle, non-sweet.Number 34: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 35: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 37: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 38: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 40: in the cycle, non-sweet.Number 41: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 43: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 44: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 46: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 47: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 49: leads to 16, non-sweet.Number 50: leads to 16, non-sweet.So, all numbers not in the sweet list lead to 16, hence are non-sweet. Therefore, the count of sweet numbers is indeed 16.Wait, but let me check if I have 16 numbers in the sweet list:3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48.Yes, that's 16 numbers.Therefore, the answer is 16.But wait, hold on. Let me think again. The problem says \\"whole numbers 1 through 50\\". So, 50 numbers in total. If 16 are sweet, then 34 are non-sweet. But when I went through each number, I found that 16 numbers are sweet, so 50-16=34 non-sweet. That seems consistent.But let me just make sure I didn't miss any numbers in the sweet list. For example, is 33 sweet? Yes, because 33→66→54→42→30→18→36→24, which is the 24 cycle, so 33 is sweet.Similarly, 39: 39→78→66→54→42→30→18→36→24, so sweet.45: 45→90→78→66→54→42→30→18→36→24, sweet.Yes, all of them seem to lead to the 24 cycle without hitting 16.Therefore, I think my conclusion is correct: there are 16 sweet numbers between 1 and 50."},{"question":"A boy has 25 copper coins. Will there be at least 7 coins of the same denomination among them?","answer":"First, I need to determine if among 25 copper coins, there must be at least 7 coins of the same denomination.To approach this, I'll consider the possible denominations of copper coins. Typically, these can be 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents.Next, I'll apply the Pigeonhole Principle, which states that if there are more items than containers, at least one container must hold more than a certain number of items.In this case, the \\"items\\" are the 25 coins, and the \\"containers\\" are the different denominations.If I assume the opposite—that no denomination has at least 7 coins—then the maximum number of coins per denomination would be 6.With 5 denominations, the total number of coins would be 5 multiplied by 6, which equals 30 coins.However, since there are only 25 coins, this assumption leads to a contradiction.Therefore, there must be at least one denomination with at least 7 coins."},{"question":"Given the function ( f(x)=frac{x^{3}}{1+x^{3}} ), find the value of the sum[ fleft(frac{1}{1}right)+fleft(frac{2}{1}right)+ldots+fleft(frac{2007}{1}right) + fleft(frac{1}{2}right)+fleft(frac{2}{2}right)+ldots+fleft(frac{2007}{2}right) + ldots + fleft(frac{1}{2007}right)+fleft(frac{2}{2007}right)+ldots+fleft(frac{2007}{2007}right)]","answer":"Okay, so I have this function ( f(x) = frac{x^3}{1 + x^3} ), and I need to compute a big sum. The sum is structured in a way where for each denominator ( k ) from 1 to 2007, I'm adding up ( f ) evaluated at ( frac{1}{k}, frac{2}{k}, ldots, frac{2007}{k} ). So, essentially, it's a double sum: for each ( k ) from 1 to 2007, sum ( fleft(frac{n}{k}right) ) where ( n ) goes from 1 to 2007. Let me write this out more formally. The total sum ( S ) is:[S = sum_{k=1}^{2007} sum_{n=1}^{2007} fleft( frac{n}{k} right)]Which is:[S = sum_{k=1}^{2007} sum_{n=1}^{2007} frac{left( frac{n}{k} right)^3}{1 + left( frac{n}{k} right)^3}]Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify the expression inside the sum. Let's see:[fleft( frac{n}{k} right) = frac{left( frac{n}{k} right)^3}{1 + left( frac{n}{k} right)^3} = frac{frac{n^3}{k^3}}{1 + frac{n^3}{k^3}} = frac{n^3}{k^3 + n^3}]So, the sum becomes:[S = sum_{k=1}^{2007} sum_{n=1}^{2007} frac{n^3}{k^3 + n^3}]Now, this double sum is symmetric in ( k ) and ( n ), right? Because if I swap ( k ) and ( n ), the expression remains the same. So, ( frac{n^3}{k^3 + n^3} = frac{k^3}{n^3 + k^3} ) when we swap ( k ) and ( n ). Wait, that might not be immediately helpful, but perhaps I can consider pairing terms where ( k ) and ( n ) are swapped. Let me think about that.Suppose I fix ( k ) and ( n ), then the term ( frac{n^3}{k^3 + n^3} ) and the term ( frac{k^3}{n^3 + k^3} ) when ( k ) and ( n ) are swapped. If I add these two terms together, I get:[frac{n^3}{k^3 + n^3} + frac{k^3}{k^3 + n^3} = frac{n^3 + k^3}{k^3 + n^3} = 1]Oh, that's nice! So, each pair of terms where ( k ) and ( n ) are swapped adds up to 1. But wait, in the double sum, each pair is counted twice except when ( k = n ). Because when ( k = n ), swapping ( k ) and ( n ) doesn't change the term. So, in that case, the term is just ( frac{n^3}{2n^3} = frac{1}{2} ).So, perhaps I can split the sum into two parts: the diagonal terms where ( k = n ), and the off-diagonal terms where ( k neq n ). Let me denote ( S = S_{text{diag}} + S_{text{off-diag}} ), where:[S_{text{diag}} = sum_{k=1}^{2007} fleft( frac{k}{k} right) = sum_{k=1}^{2007} f(1)]Since ( f(1) = frac{1}{1 + 1} = frac{1}{2} ), so:[S_{text{diag}} = 2007 times frac{1}{2} = frac{2007}{2}]Now, for the off-diagonal terms, each pair ( (k, n) ) and ( (n, k) ) contributes 1 to the sum. So, how many such pairs are there? In the double sum, there are ( 2007 times 2007 ) terms in total. Out of these, ( 2007 ) are diagonal terms where ( k = n ). So, the number of off-diagonal terms is ( 2007^2 - 2007 ). But since each pair ( (k, n) ) and ( (n, k) ) is counted twice in the double sum, the number of unique pairs is ( frac{2007^2 - 2007}{2} ). Each of these pairs contributes 1 to the sum, so:[S_{text{off-diag}} = frac{2007^2 - 2007}{2} times 1 = frac{2007(2007 - 1)}{2} = frac{2007 times 2006}{2}]Therefore, the total sum ( S ) is:[S = S_{text{diag}} + S_{text{off-diag}} = frac{2007}{2} + frac{2007 times 2006}{2}]Let me compute this:First, factor out ( frac{2007}{2} ):[S = frac{2007}{2} times (1 + 2006) = frac{2007}{2} times 2007 = frac{2007^2}{2}]Wait, hold on. Let me verify that step again. I have:[S = frac{2007}{2} + frac{2007 times 2006}{2}]So, factor out ( frac{2007}{2} ):[S = frac{2007}{2} times (1 + 2006) = frac{2007}{2} times 2007 = frac{2007^2}{2}]Yes, that seems correct. So, the total sum is ( frac{2007^2}{2} ).But let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes when dealing with double sums, especially when pairing terms, it's easy to make a mistake.So, the key insight was recognizing that for each pair ( (k, n) ) where ( k neq n ), the sum ( f(n/k) + f(k/n) = 1 ). Therefore, each such pair contributes 1 to the total sum. The number of such pairs is ( frac{2007 times 2006}{2} ) because for each ( k neq n ), we have two terms in the double sum, but each pair is counted twice. So, the number of unique pairs is ( frac{2007 times 2006}{2} ), each contributing 1, so that part is ( frac{2007 times 2006}{2} ).Then, the diagonal terms where ( k = n ) contribute ( frac{1}{2} ) each, and there are 2007 of them, so that's ( frac{2007}{2} ).Adding them together:[frac{2007}{2} + frac{2007 times 2006}{2} = frac{2007 (1 + 2006)}{2} = frac{2007 times 2007}{2} = frac{2007^2}{2}]Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire double sum can be considered as summing over all ( k ) and ( n ), and each pair ( (k, n) ) and ( (n, k) ) adds up to 1, except when ( k = n ), which adds ( frac{1}{2} ). So, the total number of terms is ( 2007^2 ). If I consider that each pair ( (k, n) ) and ( (n, k) ) contributes 1, except when ( k = n ), which contributes ( frac{1}{2} ). So, the total sum would be:Number of such pairs: ( frac{2007^2 - 2007}{2} ) each contributing 1, plus ( 2007 times frac{1}{2} ).So, total sum:[frac{2007^2 - 2007}{2} + frac{2007}{2} = frac{2007^2 - 2007 + 2007}{2} = frac{2007^2}{2}]Yes, that also gives the same result. So, I think my reasoning is correct.Therefore, the value of the sum is ( frac{2007^2}{2} ). But let me compute ( 2007^2 ) just to make sure.( 2007 times 2007 ). Let's compute that:( 2000^2 = 4,000,000 )( 2 times 2000 times 7 = 2 times 2000 times 7 = 28,000 )( 7^2 = 49 )So, ( (2000 + 7)^2 = 2000^2 + 2 times 2000 times 7 + 7^2 = 4,000,000 + 28,000 + 49 = 4,028,049 )Therefore, ( frac{2007^2}{2} = frac{4,028,049}{2} = 2,014,024.5 )But since the problem is presented with integer limits and the function ( f(x) ) is rational, the sum is a fraction. So, 2,014,024.5 is equal to ( frac{4,028,049}{2} ), which is the same as ( frac{2007^2}{2} ).So, the final answer is ( frac{2007^2}{2} ), which is ( frac{4,028,049}{2} ), but in the box, I should write it as ( boxed{dfrac{2007^2}{2}} ) or ( boxed{dfrac{4028049}{2}} ). Since ( 2007^2 ) is 4,028,049, both are correct, but perhaps the former is more elegant.Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the initial step. The function is ( f(x) = frac{x^3}{1 + x^3} ). So, when I have ( f(n/k) = frac{(n/k)^3}{1 + (n/k)^3} = frac{n^3}{k^3 + n^3} ). Then, when I pair ( f(n/k) + f(k/n) ), it's ( frac{n^3}{n^3 + k^3} + frac{k^3}{k^3 + n^3} = 1 ). So, that part is correct.Therefore, the total sum is indeed ( frac{2007^2}{2} ). So, I think my conclusion is correct.**Final Answer**boxed{dfrac{2007^2}{2}}"},{"question":"If ((x+y)^{2}-(x-y)^{2}=20), then (xy) is equal to:(a) 0(b) 1(c) 2(d) 5(e) 10","answer":"To solve the equation ((x + y)^2 - (x - y)^2 = 20), I'll start by expanding both squares.First, expand ((x + y)^2):[(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2]Next, expand ((x - y)^2):[(x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2]Now, subtract the second expansion from the first:[(x + y)^2 - (x - y)^2 = (x^2 + 2xy + y^2) - (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = 4xy]Set this equal to 20:[4xy = 20]Finally, solve for (xy):[xy = frac{20}{4} = 5]"},{"question":"In an addition problem with two numbers, the first addend is 2000 less than the sum, and the sum is 6 more than the second addend.Reconstruct the problem.","answer":"First, I'll define the variables.

Let me start with the second equation because it seems like it might be easier to manipulate.Looking at the second equation:frac{2x + 3y - 29}{2} = frac{7x - 8y}{3} + 8I can try to eliminate the denominators by finding a common multiple. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common multiple is 6. Let me multiply both sides of the equation by 6 to get rid of the fractions.Multiplying each term by 6:6 times frac{2x + 3y - 29}{2} = 6 times frac{7x - 8y}{3} + 6 times 8Simplifying each term:- The left side: 6 divided by 2 is 3, so it becomes 3*(2x + 3y - 29)- The first term on the right: 6 divided by 3 is 2, so it becomes 2*(7x - 8y)- The second term on the right: 6*8 is 48So now the equation is:3(2x + 3y - 29) = 2(7x - 8y) + 48Let me expand both sides:Left side:3*2x = 6x3*3y = 9y3*(-29) = -87So left side is 6x + 9y - 87Right side:2*7x = 14x2*(-8y) = -16yPlus 48So right side is 14x - 16y + 48Now, let's write the equation:6x + 9y - 87 = 14x - 16y + 48I need to get all the x terms and y terms on one side and constants on the other. Let me subtract 6x and 9y from both sides to move them to the right:0 = 14x - 6x -16y -9y + 48 + 87Simplify:14x -6x is 8x-16y -9y is -25y48 +87 is 135So the equation becomes:0 = 8x -25y +135Let me write it as:8x -25y +135 = 0Or, rearranged:8x -25y = -135Hmm, okay, so that's a linear equation. Let me note that as equation (2a):8x -25y = -135Now, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's see, perhaps solve for x or y. Let me try solving for x.From equation (2a):8x = 25y -135So,x = frac{25y -135}{8}Alright, so now I have x expressed in terms of y. Maybe I can substitute this into the first equation to solve for y.Looking back at the first equation:frac{10}{2x + 3y -29} + frac{9}{7x -8y +24} = 8Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let me see. Since I have x in terms of y, I can substitute x = (25y -135)/8 into both denominators.Let me compute the denominators first.First denominator: 2x + 3y -29Substituting x:2*(25y -135)/8 + 3y -29Simplify:(50y - 270)/8 + 3y -29Let me write 3y as 24y/8 to have a common denominator:(50y -270 +24y)/8 -29Combine like terms:(74y -270)/8 -29Now, write 29 as 232/8:(74y -270 -232)/8 = (74y -502)/8So, first denominator simplifies to (74y -502)/8Similarly, second denominator: 7x -8y +24Substituting x:7*(25y -135)/8 -8y +24Simplify:(175y -945)/8 -8y +24Write -8y as -64y/8:(175y -945 -64y)/8 +24Combine like terms:(111y -945)/8 +24Write 24 as 192/8:(111y -945 +192)/8 = (111y -753)/8So, second denominator simplifies to (111y -753)/8Now, substitute these back into the first equation.First equation becomes:frac{10}{(74y -502)/8} + frac{9}{(111y -753)/8} = 8Simplify each fraction by multiplying numerator and denominator:First term:10 divided by (74y -502)/8 is 10 * (8)/(74y -502) = 80/(74y -502)Second term:9 divided by (111y -753)/8 is 9 * (8)/(111y -753) = 72/(111y -753)So, the equation is now:frac{80}{74y -502} + frac{72}{111y -753} = 8Hmm, this still looks complicated, but maybe I can factor out some terms in the denominators to simplify.Looking at 74y -502: Let's see if 74 and 502 have a common factor. 74 is 2*37, and 502 divided by 2 is 251, which is a prime number. So, 74y -502 = 2*(37y -251)Similarly, 111y -753: 111 is 3*37, and 753 divided by 3 is 251. So, 111y -753 = 3*(37y -251)Ah! So both denominators have a common factor of (37y -251). That's helpful.So, let me rewrite the denominators:First denominator: 2*(37y -251)Second denominator: 3*(37y -251)So, substituting back in, the equation becomes:frac{80}{2(37y -251)} + frac{72}{3(37y -251)} = 8Simplify the fractions:First term: 80/2 is 40, so 40/(37y -251)Second term: 72/3 is 24, so 24/(37y -251)So now, the equation is:frac{40}{37y -251} + frac{24}{37y -251} = 8Since both terms have the same denominator, I can combine them:frac{40 + 24}{37y -251} = 8Which simplifies to:frac{64}{37y -251} = 8Now, solve for y. Let me write this as:frac{64}{37y -251} = 8Multiply both sides by (37y -251):64 = 8*(37y -251)Divide both sides by 8:8 = 37y -251Add 251 to both sides:8 + 251 = 37y259 = 37yDivide both sides by 37:y = 259 / 37Let me compute that. 37 times 7 is 259, right? 37*7=259. So, y=7.Okay, so y is 7. Now, let's find x using the expression we had earlier from equation (2a):x = frac{25y -135}{8}Substitute y=7:x = frac{25*7 -135}{8}x = frac{175 -135}{8}x = frac{40}{8}x = 5So, x is 5 and y is 7.Wait, let me double-check these values in both original equations to make sure.First, let's check the second equation because it's simpler.Second equation:frac{2x + 3y -29}{2} = frac{7x -8y}{3} +8Substitute x=5 and y=7:Left side:2*5 + 3*7 -29 = 10 +21 -29 = 31 -29 = 2So, 2/2 = 1Right side:7*5 -8*7 = 35 -56 = -21So, (-21)/3 +8 = -7 +8 = 1Yes, both sides equal 1. Good.Now, check the first equation:frac{10}{2x +3y -29} + frac{9}{7x -8y +24} =8Substitute x=5 and y=7:Compute denominators:2x +3y -29 = 10 +21 -29 = 31 -29 = 27x -8y +24 = 35 -56 +24 = (35 +24) -56 = 59 -56 = 3So, first term: 10/2 =5Second term:9/3=3So, 5 +3=8, which matches the right side.Perfect, both equations are satisfied.So, the solution is x=5 and y=7.**Final Answer**The solution to the system is boxed{x = 5} and boxed{y = 7}."},{"question":"In a race, Lotar finished before Manfred, Victor finished after Jan, Manfred finished before Jan, and Eddy finished before Victor.

Boris first increased the price by 60%, sold 15 bags, then increased the price by another 40% and sold the remaining 45 bags.It turned out that Boris made 1200 rubles more than Andrey. How many rubles did one bag of potatoes cost from the farmer?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Andrey and Boris both bought 60 bags of potatoes from the same farmer. Each bag was priced equally. Then, Andrey sold all his bags with a 100% price increase. Boris did something a bit more complicated: he first increased the price by 60%, sold 15 bags, then increased the price by another 40% and sold the remaining 45 bags. In the end, Boris made 1200 rubles more than Andrey. I need to find out how much one bag of potatoes cost from the farmer.Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, let me figure out what each of them did in terms of pricing and sales.Let me denote the original price per bag as ( x ) rubles. That's what the farmer charged both Andrey and Boris for each bag.Starting with Andrey: he sold all his 60 bags with a 100% price increase. A 100% increase means he doubled the price. So, the selling price per bag for Andrey is ( x + 100% times x = 2x ). Therefore, Andrey sold each bag for ( 2x ) rubles.Since he sold all 60 bags, his total revenue is ( 60 times 2x = 120x ) rubles.Now, moving on to Boris. He did two different price increases. First, he increased the price by 60%, sold 15 bags, then increased the price by another 40% and sold the remaining 45 bags.Let me calculate Boris's selling prices step by step.First, the initial price increase of 60%. So, the new price after a 60% increase is ( x + 60% times x = 1.6x ). He sold 15 bags at this price, so the revenue from the first 15 bags is ( 15 times 1.6x ).Then, he increased the price by another 40%. Wait, is this 40% of the original price or 40% of the already increased price? Hmm, the problem says \\"increased the price by another 40%\\", so I think it's 40% of the current price, which was already increased by 60%. So, the second price increase is 40% of 1.6x.Calculating that: 40% of 1.6x is ( 0.4 times 1.6x = 0.64x ). So, the new price becomes ( 1.6x + 0.64x = 2.24x ).Therefore, Boris sold the remaining 45 bags at ( 2.24x ) rubles each. So, the revenue from the second batch is ( 45 times 2.24x ).Now, let's compute Boris's total revenue. It's the sum of the revenue from the first 15 bags and the revenue from the remaining 45 bags.First part: ( 15 times 1.6x = 24x ).Second part: ( 45 times 2.24x ). Let me calculate 45 times 2.24. 45 times 2 is 90, and 45 times 0.24 is 10.8, so total is 90 + 10.8 = 100.8. So, 45 times 2.24x is 100.8x.Therefore, Boris's total revenue is ( 24x + 100.8x = 124.8x ) rubles.Now, according to the problem, Boris made 1200 rubles more than Andrey. So, Boris's total revenue minus Andrey's total revenue is 1200 rubles.So, ( 124.8x - 120x = 1200 ).Simplifying that: ( 4.8x = 1200 ).To find ( x ), divide both sides by 4.8:( x = 1200 / 4.8 ).Calculating that: 1200 divided by 4.8. Hmm, 4.8 goes into 1200 how many times?Well, 4.8 times 250 is 1200 because 4.8 times 100 is 480, 4.8 times 200 is 960, and 4.8 times 50 is 240. So, 960 + 240 = 1200. So, 4.8 times 250 is 1200. Therefore, ( x = 250 ).So, the original price per bag was 250 rubles.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, Andrey sold 60 bags at 2x, so 60*2x=120x.Boris sold 15 bags at 1.6x, which is 24x, and 45 bags at 2.24x, which is 100.8x. So, total is 24x + 100.8x = 124.8x.Difference is 124.8x - 120x = 4.8x = 1200.So, x = 1200 / 4.8 = 250.Yes, that seems correct. So, each bag cost 250 rubles from the farmer.**Final Answer**The cost of one bag of potatoes was boxed{250} rubles."},{"question":"A unit-length segment is divided into 3 equal parts, and the middle part is discarded. Each of the remaining two segments is then divided into 3 equal parts, and their middle parts are also discarded. This process is repeated for the remaining segments, and so on. Suppose this process is repeated 16 times. How many segments of length 1 / 3^{16} remain?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a unit-length segment is divided into three equal parts, and the middle part is discarded. Then each of the remaining two segments is divided into three equal parts, and their middle parts are also discarded. This process is repeated 16 times, and I need to find how many segments of length (1 / 3^{16}) remain.Hmm, this sounds familiar. It seems similar to the construction of the Cantor set. In the Cantor set, you start with the interval [0,1], remove the middle third, then remove the middle third of each remaining interval, and so on. Each iteration removes more segments, and the remaining set becomes more fragmented.So, in each step, we're dividing each remaining segment into three equal parts and removing the middle part. That means each step reduces the number of segments in a particular way.Let me try to model this step by step.First, at step 0, we have just the original segment. So, the number of segments is 1.At step 1, we divide the segment into three parts, each of length (1/3), and remove the middle one. So, we're left with two segments. So, the number of segments is 2.At step 2, each of those two segments is divided into three parts, each of length (1/9), and we remove the middle part from each. So, each segment becomes two segments, so total number of segments becomes (2 times 2 = 4).Wait, so each step, the number of segments doubles? So, step 0: 1, step 1: 2, step 2: 4, step 3: 8, and so on.So, in general, at each step (n), the number of segments is (2^n). So, after 16 steps, the number of segments should be (2^{16}).But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because in each step, each segment is being split into three, and we're removing the middle one, so each segment is replaced by two segments. So, the number of segments is multiplied by 2 each time.So, starting with 1 segment, after 1 step: 2 segments, after 2 steps: 4 segments, after 3 steps: 8 segments, etc. So, yes, it seems like the number of segments after (n) steps is (2^n).Therefore, after 16 steps, the number of segments should be (2^{16}).But wait, let me think again. The problem says \\"each of the remaining two segments is then divided into 3 equal parts, and their middle parts are also discarded.\\" So, each time, each segment is split into three, and the middle is discarded, so each segment becomes two segments.So, the number of segments is multiplied by 2 each time. So, yes, after each iteration, the number of segments is 2^n, where n is the number of iterations.So, after 16 iterations, the number of segments is (2^{16}).Calculating (2^{16}), that's 65536.But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes in these problems, the number of intervals can be different. Let me verify for the first few steps.At step 0: 1 segment.Step 1: remove the middle third, so we have two segments. So, 2 segments.Step 2: each of those two segments is split into three, removing the middle third, so each becomes two segments. So, 2 * 2 = 4.Step 3: each of the four segments is split into three, removing the middle third, so each becomes two. So, 4 * 2 = 8.Yes, so it's 2^n each time.So, after 16 steps, it's 2^16, which is 65536.Therefore, the number of segments remaining is 65536.Wait, but the problem mentions segments of length (1 / 3^{16}). So, each time we iterate, the length of each segment is divided by 3.So, after n iterations, each segment has length (1 / 3^n). So, after 16 iterations, each segment is (1 / 3^{16}) in length.Therefore, the number of such segments is 2^16, which is 65536.So, I think that's the answer.But just to make sure, let me think about how the number of segments grows.At each step, the number of segments is multiplied by 2, so after n steps, it's 2^n. So, 2^16 is 65536.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, we can model this as a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2 each time. So, the number of segments after n steps is 2^n.So, 2^16 is 65536.Therefore, the number of segments of length (1 / 3^{16}) remaining after 16 iterations is 65536.**Final Answer**The number of segments is boxed{65536}."},{"question":"Write a sequence of consecutive natural odd numbers starting from 1: 1357911131517 ldots until the number \\"2014\\" appears for the first time in this series.

So it would look like 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, ..., and so on. The sequence is just a continuous string of digits: 1357911131517... and we need to keep going until the number \\"2014\\" appears in this string for the first time.

Since we're only writing odd numbers, does \\"2014\\" ever appear in the sequence? Hmm, that seems confusing because all the numbers we're writing are odd, so \\"2014\\" is even and shouldn't be part of the sequence. Maybe I misread the problem.Let me check again. It says: \\"Write a sequence of consecutive natural odd numbers starting from 1: 1357911131517... until the number '2014' appears for the first time in this series.\\" Hmm, so maybe it's not that we're writing up to the number 2014, but rather that as we write the sequence, the digits '2014' appear somewhere in the string. So, for example, if we have a number like 12013, then the digits '2013' would be part of the sequence, but 2014 is even, so it's not written. Wait, but the problem says until '2014' appears for the first time. So maybe it's about the digits '2', '0', '1', '4' appearing consecutively in the sequence. So, we have to write the sequence until the substring '2014' appears for the first time, and then count how many digits have been written up to that point.Yes, that must be it. So, the problem is not about writing up to the number 2014, but about writing the sequence of odd numbers until the four-digit sequence '2014' appears in the concatenated string. So, we need to find the position where '2014' first occurs in the string formed by concatenating all the odd numbers starting from 1, and then count the total number of digits written up to and including the '2014'.Alright, that makes more sense. So, the task is to find the first occurrence of '2014' in the concatenated string of odd numbers and then calculate the total number of digits written up to that point.Okay, so let's plan how to approach this.First, I need to generate the sequence of odd numbers, concatenate them into a string, and then look for the substring '2014'. Once found, we can note the position where it starts and calculate the total number of digits up to that point.But generating the entire sequence until '2014' appears might be time-consuming, especially since '2014' is a four-digit number, so it could appear in the middle of a larger number. For example, maybe in the number 12013, the substring '2013' is present, but since we're dealing with odd numbers, 12013 is odd, so it would be included. Wait, but 2014 is even, so it's not in the sequence, but its digits could be part of some odd numbers.Wait, but 2014 is even, so it's not written, but the digits '2', '0', '1', '4' could appear in the concatenated string as part of other numbers. So, for example, the number 2013 is odd, so it would be written as part of the sequence, and its digits are '2', '0', '1', '3'. So, the substring '201' is present, but not '2014'. Similarly, the number 2015 is odd, so it would be written as '2015', so the substring '2015' is present, but not '2014'.Wait, but 2014 is even, so it's not written, but maybe the digits '2014' can appear across two consecutive numbers. For example, if one number ends with '20' and the next number starts with '14', then together they form '2014'. But since we're writing odd numbers, the numbers are 1, 3, 5, ..., so the transition between numbers would be from an odd number to the next odd number, which is two more. So, for example, 1999 is odd, then 2001 is the next odd number. So, the transition from 1999 to 2001 would be '19992001', which includes '992001', so maybe '92001' or something, but not '2014'.Alternatively, maybe the '2014' is entirely within a single number. But since 2014 is even, it's not written, but maybe a larger number that includes '2014' as part of its digits. For example, 120143 is an odd number, so it would be written, and within it, the substring '2014' is present. So, that could be a possibility.So, in that case, the first occurrence of '2014' would be in the number 120143, which is odd, so it's included in the sequence. Therefore, the substring '2014' appears starting at the position where '120143' is written.But wait, is 120143 the first number that contains '2014' as a substring? Or is there an earlier number?Alternatively, maybe the substring '2014' appears across two numbers. For example, if one number ends with '20' and the next number starts with '14', but since the next number is two more than the previous, if one number ends with '20', the next would be '22', so that wouldn't work. Alternatively, if one number ends with '201' and the next starts with '4', but since the next number is two more, it would be '201' + 2 = '203', so that wouldn't help.Alternatively, maybe the '2014' is split across more than two numbers, but that seems complicated.So, perhaps the first occurrence of '2014' is within a single number, which is an odd number containing '2014' as part of its digits. So, we need to find the smallest odd number that contains '2014' as a substring, and then calculate how many digits have been written up to that point.Alternatively, maybe '2014' appears in the transition between two numbers, but since the numbers are odd, the transition would be from n to n+2, so the last digit(s) of n and the first digit(s) of n+2 might form '2014'. But since n is odd, n+2 is also odd, so their last digits would be odd and the next number's first digits would depend on the number.Wait, let's think about it. Suppose we have a number ending with '201' and the next number starts with '4'. But since the next number is two more, if the previous number is x, then the next number is x+2. So, if x ends with '201', then x+2 would end with '203', so the next number would start with whatever comes after '201' + 2, which is '203', so the next number would start with '203', not '4'. So, that doesn't help.Alternatively, if a number ends with '20' and the next number starts with '14', but since the next number is two more, if the previous number is x, then x+2 would be the next number. So, if x ends with '20', then x+2 would end with '22', so the next number would start with '22', not '14'. So, that doesn't work either.Alternatively, maybe the '2014' is formed by the end of one number and the beginning of the next, but given that the numbers are odd and consecutive odd numbers differ by 2, it's unlikely that such a transition would produce '2014'.Therefore, it's more plausible that the first occurrence of '2014' is within a single odd number. So, we need to find the smallest odd number that contains '2014' as a substring. Then, we can calculate the total number of digits written up to that number.So, let's try to find the smallest odd number that contains '2014' as a substring.First, let's note that '2014' is a four-digit number. So, the smallest number that contains '2014' as a substring would be 2014 itself, but since 2014 is even, it's not in our sequence. The next possible number would be 20141, which is odd, but that's a five-digit number. Alternatively, maybe a number like 120143, which is a six-digit number, but that's larger than 20141.Wait, but 2014 is four digits, so the smallest number that includes '2014' as a substring would be 2014 itself, but since it's even, the next possible is 20141, which is odd. So, 20141 is the first odd number that contains '2014' as a substring. So, that would be the first occurrence.But wait, is there a smaller odd number that contains '2014' as a substring? For example, 20143 is another odd number, but it's larger than 20141. So, 20141 is smaller.Wait, but 20141 is 20141, which is 2014 followed by a 1. So, the substring '2014' is present at the beginning of the number. So, that would be the first occurrence.But let me check if there's a smaller number. For example, 120143 is a six-digit number, which is larger than 20141, so 20141 is smaller. So, 20141 is the first odd number that contains '2014' as a substring.Wait, but 20141 is 20141, which is 2014 followed by 1, so the substring '2014' is at the beginning. So, that's the first occurrence.But wait, let me think again. If we have a number like 120143, which is a six-digit number, the substring '2014' appears starting at the second digit. So, is 120143 smaller than 20141? No, because 120143 is 120 thousand something, which is larger than 20 thousand. So, 20141 is smaller.Therefore, 20141 is the first odd number that contains '2014' as a substring.Wait, but let me confirm. Is there a number between, say, 10000 and 20141 that contains '2014' as a substring? For example, 12014 is a five-digit number, but 12014 is even, so it's not in our sequence. The next number would be 12015, which is odd, but does it contain '2014'? Let's see: 12015. The digits are '1','2','0','1','5'. So, the substring '2014' is not present. Similarly, 12017: '1','2','0','1','7' – no. 12019: '1','2','0','1','9' – no. So, none of these contain '2014'.Similarly, 120141 is a six-digit number, but that's larger than 20141.Wait, but 20141 is a five-digit number, so it's 20,141. So, that's the first odd number that contains '2014' as a substring.Therefore, the first occurrence of '2014' in the concatenated string is at the beginning of the number 20141. So, the substring '2014' starts at the first digit of 20141.Therefore, to find the total number of digits written up to and including the '2014' substring, we need to calculate how many digits are written before 20141, plus the four digits of '2014'.Wait, but actually, the entire number 20141 is written, so we need to include all its digits, which are five digits. But the substring '2014' is the first four digits of 20141. So, the total number of digits written up to and including the '2014' substring would be the number of digits before 20141 plus four digits.But wait, actually, when we write 20141, we write all five digits, so the substring '2014' is the first four digits of that number. So, the total number of digits written up to the end of 20141 is the number of digits before 20141 plus five digits. But since we only need to count up to the first occurrence of '2014', which is the first four digits of 20141, we need to calculate the number of digits before 20141 plus four digits.Wait, but actually, the '2014' is part of 20141, so we have to include all digits up to and including the fourth digit of 20141. So, the total number of digits is the number of digits before 20141 plus four.But let's clarify: when we write the sequence, we write each odd number in full. So, before writing 20141, we have written all the odd numbers from 1 up to 20139 (since 20141 is the next odd number after 20139). So, the number of digits written before 20141 is the sum of the number of digits of all odd numbers from 1 to 20139. Then, when we write 20141, we write its five digits, but the substring '2014' is the first four digits of 20141. So, the total number of digits written up to the first occurrence of '2014' is the number of digits before 20141 plus four digits.Alternatively, if we consider that the '2014' is entirely within 20141, then we have to include all digits up to the fourth digit of 20141, which is the digit '4'. So, the total number of digits is the number of digits before 20141 plus four.But let's make sure: when we write 20141, we write '2','0','1','4','1'. So, the substring '2014' is the first four digits. So, up to and including the '4', we have written the first four digits of 20141. So, the total number of digits is the number of digits before 20141 plus four.Therefore, our task is to calculate the total number of digits written before 20141, which is the sum of the number of digits of all odd numbers from 1 to 20139, and then add four digits for the substring '2014'.So, let's break this down.First, let's find out how many digits are in each range of numbers:1-digit odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. That's five numbers, each with 1 digit. So, total digits: 5 * 1 = 5.2-digit odd numbers: from 11 to 99. How many are there? The first two-digit odd number is 11, the last is 99. The count is ((99 - 11)/2) + 1 = (88/2) + 1 = 44 + 1 = 45 numbers. Each has 2 digits, so total digits: 45 * 2 = 90.3-digit odd numbers: from 101 to 999. First is 101, last is 999. Count: ((999 - 101)/2) + 1 = (898/2) + 1 = 449 + 1 = 450 numbers. Each has 3 digits, so total digits: 450 * 3 = 1350.4-digit odd numbers: from 1001 to 9999. First is 1001, last is 9999. Count: ((9999 - 1001)/2) + 1 = (8998/2) + 1 = 4499 + 1 = 4500 numbers. Each has 4 digits, so total digits: 4500 * 4 = 18,000.But wait, we don't need all 4-digit odd numbers up to 9999, only up to 20139. Wait, 20139 is a 5-digit number. So, let's adjust.Wait, 20139 is a 5-digit number, so we need to calculate the digits contributed by 4-digit odd numbers up to 9999, and then the 5-digit odd numbers from 10001 up to 20139.So, let's recast:Total digits up to 9999:1-digit: 52-digit: 903-digit: 13504-digit: 18,000Total up to 9999: 5 + 90 + 1350 + 18,000 = 19,445 digits.Now, we need to calculate the digits contributed by 5-digit odd numbers from 10001 up to 20139.First, let's find how many 5-digit odd numbers there are from 10001 to 20139.The first 5-digit odd number is 10001, the last one before 20141 is 20139.So, the count is ((20139 - 10001)/2) + 1.Calculating:20139 - 10001 = 1013810138 / 2 = 50695069 + 1 = 5070 numbers.Each 5-digit number contributes 5 digits, so total digits from 10001 to 20139: 5070 * 5 = 25,350 digits.Therefore, total digits up to 20139 is 19,445 (up to 9999) + 25,350 (from 10001 to 20139) = 44,795 digits.Now, when we write 20141, which is the next odd number after 20139, we write its digits: '2','0','1','4','1'. The substring '2014' is the first four digits of this number. So, up to and including the '4', we have written four more digits.Therefore, the total number of digits written up to the first occurrence of '2014' is 44,795 (up to 20139) + 4 (the first four digits of 20141) = 44,800 - 1? Wait, no.Wait, 44,795 + 4 = 44,799.Wait, let me check:Total digits up to 20139: 44,795.Then, writing 20141: first four digits are '2','0','1','4', which is four digits. So, total digits up to the '4' is 44,795 + 4 = 44,799.But wait, 44,795 + 4 is 44,799.But let me confirm the calculations step by step.First, digits from 1 to 9 (1-digit): 5 numbers, 5 digits.From 11 to 99 (2-digit): 45 numbers, 90 digits. Total so far: 5 + 90 = 95.From 101 to 999 (3-digit): 450 numbers, 1350 digits. Total so far: 95 + 1350 = 1445.From 1001 to 9999 (4-digit): 4500 numbers, 18,000 digits. Total so far: 1445 + 18,000 = 19,445.From 10001 to 20139 (5-digit): 5070 numbers, 25,350 digits. Total so far: 19,445 + 25,350 = 44,795.Then, writing 20141: first four digits are '2','0','1','4', so adding 4 digits: 44,795 + 4 = 44,799.Therefore, the total number of digits written up to and including the first occurrence of '2014' is 44,799.But wait, let me double-check the count of 5-digit numbers from 10001 to 20139.First number: 10001, last number: 20139.Number of terms: ((20139 - 10001)/2) + 1.Calculating:20139 - 10001 = 10138.10138 / 2 = 5069.5069 + 1 = 5070. So, 5070 numbers, each contributing 5 digits: 5070 * 5 = 25,350. That seems correct.So, total digits up to 20139: 19,445 + 25,350 = 44,795.Then, writing 20141, which is the next number, and we only need the first four digits of it, which is '2014'. So, adding 4 digits: 44,795 + 4 = 44,799.Therefore, the total number of digits written is 44,799.Wait, but let me think again. Is 20141 the first number that contains '2014' as a substring? Or is there a smaller number?Wait, 2014 is even, so it's not written. The next number is 2015, which is odd. Does 2015 contain '2014'? No, because it's '2','0','1','5'. So, no.Similarly, 2017: '2','0','1','7' – no.2019: '2','0','1','9' – no.2021: '2','0','2','1' – no.Wait, but 20141 is the first odd number that contains '2014' as a substring. So, that seems correct.But let me check if there's a smaller number. For example, 120143 is a six-digit number, but it's larger than 20141, so 20141 is smaller.Alternatively, is there a number like 20145, which is also odd, but it's larger than 20141.So, 20141 is indeed the first odd number that contains '2014' as a substring.Therefore, the total number of digits written up to the first occurrence of '2014' is 44,799.Wait, but let me think about the transition between numbers. Is there a possibility that '2014' is formed by the end of one number and the start of another? For example, if one number ends with '20' and the next starts with '14', but since the next number is two more, the transition would be from x to x+2. So, if x ends with '20', x+2 would end with '22', so the next number would start with '22', not '14'. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, if x ends with '201' and x+2 starts with '4', but x+2 would be x + 2, so if x is ...201, then x+2 is ...203, so the next number starts with '203', not '4'. So, that doesn't help.Therefore, it's not possible for '2014' to be formed across two numbers, because the next number after an odd number is two more, which changes the last digit(s) in a way that doesn't allow '2014' to be formed across the transition.Therefore, the first occurrence of '2014' must be within a single number, which is 20141, as we concluded earlier.Therefore, the total number of digits written up to and including the first occurrence of '2014' is 44,799.Wait, but let me make sure about the count of numbers. Let's recalculate the number of 5-digit numbers from 10001 to 20139.First number: 10001Last number: 20139Number of terms: ((20139 - 10001)/2) + 1Calculating:20139 - 10001 = 1013810138 / 2 = 50695069 + 1 = 5070So, 5070 numbers, each contributing 5 digits: 5070 * 5 = 25,350 digits.So, total digits up to 20139: 19,445 + 25,350 = 44,795.Then, writing 20141, which is the next number, and we only need the first four digits: '2','0','1','4', so 4 digits.Total digits: 44,795 + 4 = 44,799.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the answer is 44,799 digits."},{"question":"Distribute 7 different books to two people, A and B. A must receive at least 2 books, B must receive at least 1 book, and the number of books each person receives cannot differ by only 1. How many different ways are there to distribute the books?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to distribute 7 different books to two people, A and B. The conditions are that A must receive at least 2 books, B must receive at least 1 book, and the number of books each person receives cannot differ by only 1. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, without any restrictions, the number of ways to distribute 7 different books to two people is (2^7), since each book can go to either A or B. But of course, we have some constraints here, so I need to adjust for those.Let me list out the constraints again to make sure I don't miss anything:1. A must receive at least 2 books.2. B must receive at least 1 book.3. The number of books each person receives cannot differ by only 1.So, starting with the first two constraints: A has to get at least 2, B at least 1. That means the possible distributions in terms of the number of books are:- A gets 2, B gets 5- A gets 3, B gets 4- A gets 4, B gets 3- A gets 5, B gets 2- A gets 6, B gets 1Wait, but hold on. The third constraint says that the number of books each person receives cannot differ by only 1. So, let's see which of these distributions violate that.If A gets 2 and B gets 5, the difference is 3, which is more than 1, so that's okay.If A gets 3 and B gets 4, the difference is 1, which is not allowed. Similarly, A gets 4 and B gets 3 is also a difference of 1, which is not allowed.A gets 5 and B gets 2, difference is 3, okay.A gets 6 and B gets 1, difference is 5, okay.So, the distributions where A gets 3 and B gets 4, or A gets 4 and B gets 3, are invalid. So, we need to exclude those cases.So, the valid distributions in terms of counts are:- A:2, B:5- A:5, B:2- A:6, B:1Wait, but hold on, what about A:1, B:6? But A must receive at least 2, so that's already excluded.Similarly, B must receive at least 1, so A can't get all 7.So, the possible distributions are only the three cases above.So, now, for each of these cases, we can compute the number of ways.Since the books are different, for each distribution, the number of ways is the combination of choosing k books for A, and the rest go to B.So, for A:2, B:5, the number of ways is (C(7,2)).Similarly, for A:5, B:2, it's (C(7,5)), and for A:6, B:1, it's (C(7,6)).But wait, (C(7,2)) is equal to (C(7,5)) because of the combination identity (C(n,k) = C(n, n - k)). Similarly, (C(7,6) = C(7,1)).So, let me compute each:1. (C(7,2) = 21)2. (C(7,5) = 21)3. (C(7,6) = 7)So, adding these up: 21 + 21 + 7 = 49.But wait, hold on. Is that all? Let me make sure I haven't missed anything.Wait, another thought: since the books are different, each distribution is unique based on which books go to A and which go to B. So, for each case, the number of ways is indeed the combination as I calculated.But let me double-check if I considered all constraints correctly.First, A must have at least 2, so A can't have 0,1. B must have at least 1, so B can't have 0. So, the possible distributions in terms of counts are:A:2, B:5A:3, B:4A:4, B:3A:5, B:2A:6, B:1But we have to exclude the cases where the difference is exactly 1, which are A:3, B:4 and A:4, B:3.So, that leaves us with A:2, B:5; A:5, B:2; and A:6, B:1.So, yes, that's three cases, as I had before.So, computing each:- For A:2, it's (C(7,2) = 21)- For A:5, it's (C(7,5) = 21)- For A:6, it's (C(7,6) = 7)Adding them together: 21 + 21 + 7 = 49.Wait, but hold on another second. The problem says \\"the number of books each person receives cannot differ by only 1.\\" So, does that mean that the absolute difference between the number of books A and B receive cannot be 1? So, in other words, |A - B| ≠ 1.Yes, that's how I interpreted it.So, in that case, the distributions where A and B differ by exactly 1 are invalid, so we exclude those.So, that seems correct.But let me think again: is there another way to approach this problem?Alternatively, I could compute the total number of distributions without any restrictions, subtract the ones that violate the constraints.But let's see:Total distributions: (2^7 = 128)Subtract distributions where A gets fewer than 2 books, or B gets fewer than 1 book, or the difference is exactly 1.But wait, that might complicate things because of overlapping constraints.Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the initial approach.But let me try this alternative method to verify.Total distributions: 128Now, subtract distributions where A gets fewer than 2 books (i.e., A gets 0 or 1):- A gets 0: (C(7,0) = 1)- A gets 1: (C(7,1) = 7)Total: 1 + 7 = 8Subtract these: 128 - 8 = 120Now, subtract distributions where B gets fewer than 1 book, which is B gets 0. But if B gets 0, then A gets all 7. So, that's 1 distribution.So, subtract 1: 120 - 1 = 119But wait, now we have subtracted too much because the case where A gets 0 and B gets 7 is already included in the first subtraction (A gets 0). Similarly, the case where A gets 7 and B gets 0 is subtracted here. But in our problem, we need to ensure that both A has at least 2 and B has at least 1. So, in the total, we have subtracted all cases where A has less than 2 or B has less than 1.But perhaps this approach is more complicated because we have to consider inclusion-exclusion.Wait, maybe it's better to compute the valid distributions directly as I did before, rather than subtracting from the total.Because when we subtract, we might end up subtracting some cases multiple times or missing some overlaps.So, perhaps my initial approach is safer.But just to make sure, let me compute both ways and see if they match.First way: Direct computation.Valid distributions:- A:2, B:5: 21- A:5, B:2: 21- A:6, B:1: 7Total: 21 + 21 + 7 = 49Second way: Total distributions minus invalid ones.Total distributions: 128Invalid distributions:1. A gets fewer than 2 books: A=0 or A=1.   - A=0: 1 way   - A=1: 7 ways   Total: 82. B gets fewer than 1 book: B=0, which is A=7: 1 way3. Distributions where |A - B| = 1.   So, A=3, B=4 and A=4, B=3.   - A=3: (C(7,3) = 35)   - A=4: (C(7,4) = 35)   Total: 35 + 35 = 70But wait, hold on. If I subtract all these, I have to be careful about overlapping cases.Because some distributions might be counted in both 1 and 3, or 2 and 3.For example, if A=1, B=6: Is this counted in both 1 and 3? Let's see.Wait, A=1, B=6: |1 - 6| = 5, which is not 1, so it's only in category 1.Similarly, A=0, B=7: |0 - 7| = 7, not 1.Similarly, A=7, B=0: same.So, the distributions where |A - B| =1 are separate from the distributions where A <2 or B <1.Hence, the total invalid distributions are 8 (A <2) + 1 (B <1) + 70 (|A - B|=1) = 79Therefore, total valid distributions would be 128 - 79 = 49Which matches the first method.So, that's reassuring.Therefore, the answer is 49.But just to make sure, let me think again.Wait, when I subtracted 8 (A <2) and 1 (B <1), and 70 (|A - B|=1), is that correct?Yes, because:- A <2: 8- B <1: 1- |A - B|=1: 70These are all distinct sets, so no overlaps, so total invalid is 8 +1 +70=79Thus, 128 -79=49.So, that's consistent.Alternatively, another way to think about it is:The number of valid distributions is the sum over k=2 to 6 (since A must have at least 2, and B must have at least 1, so A can have up to 6) of C(7,k), excluding the cases where |k - (7 -k)|=1.So, for k=2: |2 -5|=3≠1, include.k=3: |3 -4|=1, exclude.k=4: |4 -3|=1, exclude.k=5: |5 -2|=3≠1, include.k=6: |6 -1|=5≠1, include.So, sum C(7,2) + C(7,5) + C(7,6) =21 +21 +7=49.Same result.So, all methods point to 49.Therefore, I think 49 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The number of different ways to distribute the books is boxed{49}."},{"question":"A bag contains only blue balls and green balls.

Additionally, ( x ) must be a multiple of 3, and ( y ) must be a multiple of 5.To find the possible values of ( x ), I note that ( x ) can be expressed as ( 3k ), where ( k ) is a positive integer. Similarly, ( y ) can be expressed as ( 5m ), where ( m ) is a positive integer.Substituting these into the equation ( x + y = 150 ), we get:[3k + 5m = 150]Rearranging for ( m ), we have:[5m = 150 - 3k m = frac{150 - 3k}{5} = 30 - frac{3k}{5}]For ( m ) to be an integer, ( frac{3k}{5} ) must also be an integer.

The function ( f ) maps positive reals to positive reals. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let's see if I can figure this out step by step.First, I should recall some common techniques used in solving functional equations. Things like substitution, checking for injectivity or surjectivity, assuming linearity, etc. Maybe I can try substituting specific values for ( x ) or ( y ) to simplify the equation and see if I can find a pattern or deduce something about ( f ).Let me start by fixing one variable and varying the other. Let's fix ( y ) and see what happens when I vary ( x ). So, if I fix ( y ), the equation becomes ( f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y) ). Hmm, this looks a bit like a recursive relation. Maybe if I can express ( f ) in terms of itself with a shifted argument, I can find a pattern.Alternatively, I could fix ( x ) and vary ( y ). Let's try that. Suppose I fix ( x ) and let ( y ) vary. Then the equation is ( f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y) ). Hmm, not sure if that immediately helps. Maybe I can consider setting ( x ) to some specific value, like ( x = 1 ) or something, but since ( x ) is any positive real, maybe setting ( x ) to a particular value might not be helpful unless I can generalize it.Wait, another thought: maybe I can consider substituting ( x ) with ( x - f(y) ), but since ( x ) has to be positive, I need to make sure ( x - f(y) ) is still positive. That might complicate things. Maybe not the best approach.Let me think about injectivity or surjectivity. If I can show that ( f ) is injective or surjective, that might help. Let's see. Suppose ( f(a) = f(b) ) for some ( a, b in mathbb{R}^+ ). Then, substituting ( y = a ) and ( y = b ) into the equation, we get:For ( y = a ): ( f(x + f(a)) = f(x + a) + f(a) )For ( y = b ): ( f(x + f(b)) = f(x + b) + f(b) )But since ( f(a) = f(b) ), the left sides are equal. Therefore, ( f(x + a) + f(a) = f(x + b) + f(b) ). Since ( f(a) = f(b) ), this simplifies to ( f(x + a) = f(x + b) ). If this holds for all ( x > 0 ), then ( f ) is periodic with period ( |a - b| ). But wait, ( f ) maps ( mathbb{R}^+ ) to ( mathbb{R}^+ ). If ( f ) is periodic, but it's defined only on positive reals, that might not necessarily lead to a contradiction unless we can show that the period would have to be zero, implying injectivity.Alternatively, maybe ( f ) is injective. Suppose ( f(u) = f(v) ). Then, for any ( x ), ( f(x + f(u)) = f(x + u) + f(u) ) and ( f(x + f(v)) = f(x + v) + f(v) ). Since ( f(u) = f(v) ), the left sides are equal, so ( f(x + u) + f(u) = f(x + v) + f(v) ). Again, since ( f(u) = f(v) ), this simplifies to ( f(x + u) = f(x + v) ) for all ( x > 0 ). If ( f ) is injective, then ( u = v ), so ( f ) is injective. Wait, but I just used injectivity to conclude ( u = v ). So, does this mean that if ( f ) is injective, then ( f(u) = f(v) ) implies ( u = v ), which is the definition of injectivity. So, this doesn't necessarily give me new information unless I can show that ( f ) is injective.Alternatively, maybe I can show that ( f ) is additive or multiplicative. Let's see. The equation resembles a form of additivity but with a twist. Let me try to see if ( f ) could be linear. Suppose ( f(y) = ky ) for some constant ( k > 0 ). Let's test this.Substituting into the equation: ( f(x + f(y)) = f(x + ky) = k(x + ky) = kx + k^2 y )On the other hand, the right side is ( f(x + y) + f(y) = k(x + y) + ky = kx + ky + ky = kx + 2ky )So, equating both sides: ( kx + k^2 y = kx + 2ky ). Simplifying, ( k^2 y = 2ky ). Since this must hold for all ( y > 0 ), we can divide both sides by ( y ) (since ( y neq 0 )) to get ( k^2 = 2k ). So, ( k^2 - 2k = 0 ), which gives ( k(k - 2) = 0 ). Since ( k > 0 ), ( k = 2 ). So, ( f(y) = 2y ) is a solution. Hmm, that's promising.But is this the only solution? I need to check if there are other possible functions or if ( f(y) = 2y ) is the only one. Maybe I can try another approach.Let me consider setting ( x = y ). Wait, but ( x ) and ( y ) are independent variables, so setting ( x = y ) might not necessarily give me all the information, but let's try.So, substituting ( x = y ), we get ( f(y + f(y)) = f(2y) + f(y) ). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe if I can relate ( f(2y) ) to ( f(y) ), that could be useful.Alternatively, maybe I can consider substituting ( x = z - f(y) ) for some ( z > f(y) ). Wait, but ( x ) has to be positive, so ( z ) must be greater than ( f(y) ). Let me define ( z = x + f(y) ), so ( x = z - f(y) ). Then, substituting into the original equation, we get:( f(z) = f(z - f(y) + y) + f(y) )So, ( f(z) = f(z - f(y) + y) + f(y) ). Hmm, that's interesting. Let me denote ( w = z - f(y) + y ). Then, ( z = w + f(y) - y ). So, substituting back, we have:( f(w + f(y) - y) = f(w) + f(y) )Wait, that seems a bit convoluted, but maybe if I can set ( w = x ), then:( f(x + f(y) - y) = f(x) + f(y) )Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can rearrange terms. Let's write it as:( f(x + (f(y) - y)) = f(x) + f(y) )This looks similar to Cauchy's functional equation, which is ( f(x + c) = f(x) + d ), where ( c ) and ( d ) are constants. In our case, ( c = f(y) - y ) and ( d = f(y) ). But ( c ) and ( d ) depend on ( y ), which complicates things.Wait, if ( f(x + c) = f(x) + d ), then for this to hold for all ( x > 0 ), ( c ) and ( d ) must be related in a specific way. Let's think about this. If ( f(x + c) = f(x) + d ), then for any ( x ), shifting ( x ) by ( c ) increases ( f(x) ) by ( d ). If this is true for all ( x ), then ( f ) must be linear, right? Because the increase is constant per unit shift.So, if ( f ) is linear, then ( f(x) = kx + b ). But wait, our function maps ( mathbb{R}^+ ) to ( mathbb{R}^+ ), so ( f(x) ) must be positive for all positive ( x ). If ( f ) is linear, ( f(x) = kx + b ), then ( b ) must be non-negative, but since ( f ) maps to positive reals, ( b ) must be positive or zero. But if ( b = 0 ), then ( f(x) = kx ), which is positive for ( k > 0 ).Wait, earlier I tried ( f(y) = ky ) and found that ( k = 2 ). So, ( f(y) = 2y ) is a solution. But if ( f ) is linear, is that the only solution? Let's check.Suppose ( f(x) = kx + b ). Let's substitute into the original equation:( f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y) )Left side: ( f(x + f(y)) = k(x + f(y)) + b = kx + k f(y) + b = kx + k(k y + b) + b = kx + k^2 y + k b + b )Right side: ( f(x + y) + f(y) = [k(x + y) + b] + [k y + b] = kx + k y + b + k y + b = kx + 2k y + 2b )Set left side equal to right side:( kx + k^2 y + k b + b = kx + 2k y + 2b )Simplify by subtracting ( kx ) from both sides:( k^2 y + k b + b = 2k y + 2b )Now, collect like terms:For ( y ): ( k^2 y = 2k y ) => ( k^2 = 2k ) => ( k(k - 2) = 0 ) => ( k = 0 ) or ( k = 2 ). But ( k = 0 ) would make ( f(x) = b ), a constant function. Let's check if that's possible.If ( k = 0 ), then ( f(x) = b ). Substitute into the original equation:( f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y) ) becomes ( b = b + b ) => ( b = 2b ) => ( b = 0 ). But ( f ) maps to ( mathbb{R}^+ ), so ( b = 0 ) is not allowed because ( f(x) ) must be positive. Therefore, ( k = 2 ).Now, with ( k = 2 ), let's look at the constant terms:From ( k^2 y + k b + b = 2k y + 2b ), we have:( 4y + 2b + b = 4y + 2b ) => ( 4y + 3b = 4y + 2b ) => ( 3b = 2b ) => ( b = 0 ).Again, ( b = 0 ), but ( f(x) = 2x ) is positive for all ( x > 0 ), so that's acceptable. Therefore, the only linear solution is ( f(x) = 2x ).But does this mean that ( f(x) = 2x ) is the only solution? Or could there be non-linear solutions as well? I need to check if the function must necessarily be linear.Going back to the equation ( f(x + (f(y) - y)) = f(x) + f(y) ). If I denote ( c = f(y) - y ), then the equation becomes ( f(x + c) = f(x) + f(y) ). But ( c ) depends on ( y ), so for each ( y ), there's a corresponding ( c ) such that shifting ( x ) by ( c ) increases ( f(x) ) by ( f(y) ).This seems to suggest that ( f ) has a linear behavior, but let's see if we can formalize this. Let me fix ( y ) and consider the function ( f ) shifted by ( c = f(y) - y ). Then, ( f(x + c) = f(x) + f(y) ). If I denote ( d = f(y) ), then ( c = d - y ), so ( f(x + d - y) = f(x) + d ).Wait, this is similar to the equation ( f(x + a) = f(x) + b ), which typically has solutions of the form ( f(x) = frac{b}{a}x + k ), but in our case, ( a = d - y ) and ( b = d ), but ( a ) and ( b ) are related through ( d = f(y) ).This seems a bit tangled. Maybe another approach: suppose I define ( g(x) = f(x) - 2x ). Let's see if this helps. Then, ( f(x) = g(x) + 2x ). Substitute into the original equation:( f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y) )Left side: ( f(x + f(y)) = g(x + f(y)) + 2(x + f(y)) = g(x + f(y)) + 2x + 2f(y) )Right side: ( f(x + y) + f(y) = [g(x + y) + 2(x + y)] + [g(y) + 2y] = g(x + y) + 2x + 2y + g(y) + 2y = g(x + y) + g(y) + 2x + 4y )Set left equal to right:( g(x + f(y)) + 2x + 2f(y) = g(x + y) + g(y) + 2x + 4y )Simplify by subtracting ( 2x ) from both sides:( g(x + f(y)) + 2f(y) = g(x + y) + g(y) + 4y )Now, recall that ( f(y) = g(y) + 2y ). So, substitute ( f(y) ) into the equation:( g(x + g(y) + 2y) + 2(g(y) + 2y) = g(x + y) + g(y) + 4y )Simplify the left side:( g(x + g(y) + 2y) + 2g(y) + 4y )So, the equation becomes:( g(x + g(y) + 2y) + 2g(y) + 4y = g(x + y) + g(y) + 4y )Subtract ( 4y ) from both sides:( g(x + g(y) + 2y) + 2g(y) = g(x + y) + g(y) )Simplify by subtracting ( g(y) ) from both sides:( g(x + g(y) + 2y) + g(y) = g(x + y) )Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe if I can set ( x = z - g(y) - 2y ), but ( x ) has to be positive, so ( z ) must be greater than ( g(y) + 2y ). Let me try that substitution.Let ( x = z - g(y) - 2y ), then ( z = x + g(y) + 2y ). Substituting into the equation:( g(z) + g(y) = g(z - g(y) - 2y + y) = g(z - g(y) - y) )So, ( g(z) + g(y) = g(z - g(y) - y) )Hmm, this is getting more convoluted. Maybe I need a different approach.Let me go back to the original equation and see if I can find another substitution. Suppose I set ( x = t - f(y) ), but ( x ) must be positive, so ( t > f(y) ). Then, substituting into the equation:( f(t) = f(t - f(y) + y) + f(y) )So, ( f(t) = f(t - f(y) + y) + f(y) ). Let me denote ( s = t - f(y) + y ), so ( t = s + f(y) - y ). Then, substituting back:( f(s + f(y) - y) = f(s) + f(y) )Wait, this is similar to what I had before. So, ( f(s + (f(y) - y)) = f(s) + f(y) ). Let me denote ( c = f(y) - y ), so ( f(s + c) = f(s) + f(y) ). But ( c ) is a function of ( y ), so for each ( y ), there's a ( c ) such that shifting ( s ) by ( c ) increases ( f(s) ) by ( f(y) ).This seems to suggest that ( f ) is additive with respect to these shifts. If ( f ) is additive, then it's linear, but I need to formalize this.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the function ( f ) being linear as the only solution. Since I found that ( f(x) = 2x ) works, and assuming that it's the only solution, maybe I can prove that ( f ) must be linear.Wait, another idea: let's consider the function ( f ) and see if it's injective. Suppose ( f(a) = f(b) ). Then, as I thought earlier, ( f(x + a) = f(x + b) ) for all ( x > 0 ). If ( f ) is injective, then ( a = b ), so ( f ) is injective.But how can I show that ( f ) is injective? Let me see if I can derive injectivity from the given equation.Suppose ( f(u) = f(v) ). Then, for any ( x > 0 ), ( f(x + f(u)) = f(x + u) + f(u) ) and ( f(x + f(v)) = f(x + v) + f(v) ). Since ( f(u) = f(v) ), the left sides are equal, so ( f(x + u) + f(u) = f(x + v) + f(v) ). But since ( f(u) = f(v) ), this simplifies to ( f(x + u) = f(x + v) ) for all ( x > 0 ). If ( f ) is injective, then ( u = v ), so ( f ) is injective. But this is circular reasoning because I assumed ( f(u) = f(v) ) to show injectivity.Wait, maybe I can use the original equation to show injectivity without assuming injectivity. Let me try.Suppose ( f(a) = f(b) ). Then, as above, ( f(x + a) = f(x + b) ) for all ( x > 0 ). Let me set ( x = t - a ) for ( t > a ). Then, ( f(t) = f(t - a + b) ). Similarly, setting ( x = t - b ), ( f(t) = f(t - b + a) ). So, ( f(t) = f(t - a + b) = f(t - b + a) ). Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can set ( x = y ) in the original equation. Wait, I tried that earlier, but let me see again.Setting ( x = y ), we get ( f(y + f(y)) = f(2y) + f(y) ). If ( f ) is injective, then ( y + f(y) ) must be unique for each ( y ), but I'm not sure.Wait, another approach: let's consider the function ( f ) and see if it's increasing or decreasing. Since ( f ) maps ( mathbb{R}^+ ) to ( mathbb{R}^+ ), it's possible that ( f ) is increasing. Let me see if I can show that.Suppose ( a > b > 0 ). I want to show that ( f(a) > f(b) ). Let me see if I can relate ( f(a) ) and ( f(b) ) using the functional equation.Let me set ( x = a - b ) and ( y = b ). Then, the equation becomes:( f((a - b) + f(b)) = f((a - b) + b) + f(b) ) => ( f(a - b + f(b)) = f(a) + f(b) )But ( a - b + f(b) ) is some positive real number, say ( c ). So, ( f(c) = f(a) + f(b) ). Hmm, not sure if that directly shows ( f(a) > f(b) ), but maybe if I can express ( f(a) ) in terms of ( f(c) ) and ( f(b) ), which are both positive.Wait, if ( f(c) = f(a) + f(b) ), then ( f(a) = f(c) - f(b) ). Since ( f(c) ) and ( f(b) ) are positive, ( f(a) ) must be less than ( f(c) ). But I don't know if ( c ) is greater or less than ( a ). Hmm, not helpful.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the behavior as ( x ) approaches infinity. Let me see.As ( x ) becomes very large, ( f(x + f(y)) ) and ( f(x + y) ) would behave in a certain way depending on the growth rate of ( f ). If ( f ) is linear, say ( f(x) = 2x ), then both sides would grow linearly. If ( f ) is sublinear, maybe the left side grows slower, and if it's superlinear, the left side grows faster.But without knowing more about ( f ), it's hard to say. Maybe I can assume ( f ) is differentiable or something, but the problem doesn't specify that.Wait, going back to the equation ( f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y) ). Let me try to see if I can express ( f(x + f(y)) - f(x + y) = f(y) ). This suggests that the difference in ( f ) over an interval of length ( f(y) - y ) is equal to ( f(y) ). If ( f(y) - y ) is a constant, say ( c ), then ( f(x + c) - f(x) = f(y) ). But ( f(y) ) depends on ( y ), so unless ( c ) is zero, which would mean ( f(y) = y ), but ( f(y) = y ) doesn't satisfy the original equation. Let me check:If ( f(y) = y ), then the left side is ( f(x + y) = x + y ), and the right side is ( f(x + y) + f(y) = (x + y) + y = x + 2y ). These are equal only if ( x + y = x + 2y ), which implies ( y = 0 ), but ( y ) is positive. So, ( f(y) = y ) is not a solution.Therefore, ( f(y) - y ) cannot be a constant unless it's zero, which doesn't work. So, ( f(y) - y ) varies with ( y ), meaning that the difference ( f(x + c) - f(x) ) is equal to ( f(y) ), where ( c = f(y) - y ). This seems to suggest that ( f ) has a linear component because the difference depends linearly on ( y ).Wait, if ( f(x + c) - f(x) = f(y) ), and ( c = f(y) - y ), then ( f(x + c) = f(x) + f(y) ). If I can express ( c ) in terms of ( f(y) ), maybe I can find a relationship.Let me denote ( c = f(y) - y ), so ( f(x + c) = f(x) + f(y) ). Let me differentiate both sides with respect to ( x ), assuming ( f ) is differentiable. Then, ( f'(x + c) = f'(x) ). This suggests that ( f' ) is periodic with period ( c ). But ( c ) depends on ( y ), so unless ( c ) is zero, which we saw doesn't work, ( f' ) would have to be constant, implying ( f ) is linear. But this is under the assumption that ( f ) is differentiable, which isn't given in the problem.Hmm, maybe I can avoid assuming differentiability. Let me think about the equation ( f(x + c) = f(x) + f(y) ) where ( c = f(y) - y ). If I set ( x = 1 ), then ( f(1 + c) = f(1) + f(y) ). But ( c = f(y) - y ), so ( f(1 + f(y) - y) = f(1) + f(y) ). Let me denote ( z = 1 + f(y) - y ), so ( f(z) = f(1) + f(y) ). But ( z = 1 + f(y) - y ), so ( f(z) = f(1) + f(y) ). Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, maybe I can express ( f(y) ) in terms of ( f(z) ) and ( f(1) ). Let me rearrange:( f(z) - f(1) = f(y) ). But ( z = 1 + f(y) - y ), so ( f(z) - f(1) = f(y) ). Let me substitute ( f(z) = f(1) + f(y) ) into the equation ( z = 1 + f(y) - y ):( z = 1 + (f(z) - f(1)) - y )So, ( z = 1 + f(z) - f(1) - y )Rearranging, ( f(z) = z + f(1) - 1 + y )But ( z = 1 + f(y) - y ), so substituting back:( f(z) = (1 + f(y) - y) + f(1) - 1 + y = f(y) + f(1) )Which is consistent with our earlier equation ( f(z) = f(1) + f(y) ). So, this doesn't give us new information.Maybe I need to consider another substitution. Let me try setting ( y = x ). Wait, I already tried ( x = y ), but let me see again.Setting ( x = y ), we have ( f(y + f(y)) = f(2y) + f(y) ). Let me denote ( w = y + f(y) ), so ( f(w) = f(2y) + f(y) ). But ( w = y + f(y) ), so ( f(w) = f(2y) + f(y) ). Hmm, not sure.Wait, another idea: let's consider the function ( f ) and see if it's linear by checking if ( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) ). But the original equation is ( f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y) ). If ( f ) were additive, then ( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + f(f(y)) ), and the original equation would become ( f(x) + f(f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y) ). If ( f ) is additive, then ( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) ), so substituting, we get ( f(x) + f(f(y)) = f(x) + f(y) + f(y) ), which simplifies to ( f(f(y)) = 2f(y) ). So, if ( f ) is additive, then ( f(f(y)) = 2f(y) ).But earlier, I found that ( f(y) = 2y ) is a solution, which is additive and satisfies ( f(f(y)) = f(2y) = 4y = 2f(y) ). So, that works. But does this mean that ( f ) must be additive?Wait, let me think. If ( f ) is additive, then ( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) ), and if it's also linear, then ( f(x) = kx ). But in our case, the functional equation is not the Cauchy equation, but a variation of it. So, maybe ( f ) is additive but not necessarily linear? But in our case, we have ( f(f(y)) = 2f(y) ), which for additive functions implies ( f(y) = 2y ), as we saw.Alternatively, maybe ( f ) is not additive, but the functional equation enforces a form of linearity.Wait, going back to the equation ( f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y) ). Let me try to see if I can express ( f(x + f(y)) - f(x + y) = f(y) ). This suggests that the difference in ( f ) over an interval of length ( f(y) - y ) is equal to ( f(y) ). If ( f(y) - y ) is a constant, say ( c ), then ( f(x + c) - f(x) = f(y) ). But ( f(y) ) depends on ( y ), so unless ( c ) is zero, which would mean ( f(y) = y ), which doesn't work, as we saw earlier, this suggests that ( f(y) ) must be proportional to ( f(y) - y ).Wait, let me write that as ( f(y) = k(f(y) - y) ), where ( k ) is some constant. Then, ( f(y) = k f(y) - k y ), which rearranges to ( f(y) - k f(y) = -k y ), so ( f(y)(1 - k) = -k y ), hence ( f(y) = frac{-k}{1 - k} y ). Since ( f(y) ) must be positive, ( frac{-k}{1 - k} ) must be positive. Let's solve for ( k ):( frac{-k}{1 - k} > 0 )This implies that ( -k ) and ( 1 - k ) have the same sign.Case 1: Both positive.- ( -k > 0 ) => ( k < 0 )- ( 1 - k > 0 ) => ( k < 1 )So, ( k < 0 ) satisfies both.Case 2: Both negative.- ( -k < 0 ) => ( k > 0 )- ( 1 - k < 0 ) => ( k > 1 )So, ( k > 1 ) satisfies both.But ( f(y) = frac{-k}{1 - k} y ) must be positive for all ( y > 0 ). Let's see:If ( k < 0 ), then ( frac{-k}{1 - k} = frac{|k|}{1 - k} ). Since ( k < 0 ), ( 1 - k > 1 ), so the fraction is positive.If ( k > 1 ), then ( frac{-k}{1 - k} = frac{k}{k - 1} ), which is positive because both numerator and denominator are positive.So, ( f(y) = frac{-k}{1 - k} y ) is positive for ( k < 0 ) or ( k > 1 ). Let me denote ( f(y) = c y ), where ( c = frac{-k}{1 - k} ). Then, ( c ) must be positive.Let me express ( c ) in terms of ( k ):From ( c = frac{-k}{1 - k} ), we can solve for ( k ):( c(1 - k) = -k )( c - c k = -k )( c = c k - k )( c = k(c - 1) )( k = frac{c}{c - 1} )Now, since ( f(y) = c y ), let's substitute back into the original equation to find ( c ).Original equation: ( f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y) )Left side: ( f(x + c y) = c(x + c y) = c x + c^2 y )Right side: ( f(x + y) + f(y) = c(x + y) + c y = c x + c y + c y = c x + 2 c y )Set equal:( c x + c^2 y = c x + 2 c y )Simplify:( c^2 y = 2 c y )Divide both sides by ( y ) (since ( y > 0 )):( c^2 = 2 c )So, ( c^2 - 2 c = 0 ) => ( c(c - 2) = 0 ). Since ( c > 0 ), ( c = 2 ).Therefore, ( f(y) = 2 y ) is the only solution of this form. So, this suggests that ( f(y) = 2 y ) is the only solution.But wait, earlier I assumed that ( f(y) = k(f(y) - y) ), which led me to ( f(y) = c y ). Is this assumption valid? I mean, I derived that ( f(x + c) = f(x) + f(y) ) where ( c = f(y) - y ), and then I assumed that ( f(y) ) is proportional to ( c ). But is that necessarily the case?Alternatively, maybe I can consider that for each ( y ), ( f(x + c) = f(x) + f(y) ), where ( c = f(y) - y ). If I fix ( y ) and vary ( x ), this suggests that ( f ) is linear with slope ( f(y)/c ). But since ( c = f(y) - y ), the slope would be ( f(y)/(f(y) - y) ). However, for ( f ) to be linear, this slope must be constant for all ( y ). Therefore, ( f(y)/(f(y) - y) = k ), a constant. Solving for ( f(y) ):( f(y) = k(f(y) - y) )Which is the same equation as before, leading to ( f(y) = 2 y ).Therefore, this suggests that ( f(y) = 2 y ) is indeed the only solution.To confirm, let's substitute ( f(y) = 2 y ) back into the original equation:Left side: ( f(x + f(y)) = f(x + 2 y) = 2(x + 2 y) = 2x + 4 y )Right side: ( f(x + y) + f(y) = 2(x + y) + 2 y = 2x + 2 y + 2 y = 2x + 4 y )Both sides are equal, so ( f(y) = 2 y ) satisfies the equation.Therefore, after considering various approaches and substitutions, it seems that the only solution is ( f(x) = 2x )."},{"question":"Find the smallest positive integer  n  for which  315^2-n^2  evenly divides  315^3-n^3 .*Proposed by Kyle Lee*","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: Find the smallest positive integer ( n ) for which ( 315^2 - n^2 ) evenly divides ( 315^3 - n^3 ). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that ( 315^3 - n^3 ) is a difference of cubes, which can be factored. The formula for the difference of cubes is ( a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) ). So, applying that here, I can write:[315^3 - n^3 = (315 - n)(315^2 + 315n + n^2)]Similarly, ( 315^2 - n^2 ) is a difference of squares, which factors as ( (315 - n)(315 + n) ). So, we have:[315^2 - n^2 = (315 - n)(315 + n)]The problem states that ( 315^2 - n^2 ) divides ( 315^3 - n^3 ). So, substituting the factored forms, we get:[(315 - n)(315 + n) mid (315 - n)(315^2 + 315n + n^2)]Since ( 315 - n ) is a common factor in both, we can cancel it out, assuming ( 315 neq n ), which is true because ( n ) is a positive integer less than 315 (since we're looking for the smallest positive integer). So, we're left with:[315 + n mid 315^2 + 315n + n^2]So, now the problem reduces to finding the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that ( 315 + n ) divides ( 315^2 + 315n + n^2 ).Let me denote ( d = 315 + n ). Then, ( n = d - 315 ). Let's substitute this into the expression ( 315^2 + 315n + n^2 ):[315^2 + 315n + n^2 = 315^2 + 315(d - 315) + (d - 315)^2]Let me compute each term step by step:1. ( 315^2 ) is just ( 315^2 ).2. ( 315(d - 315) = 315d - 315^2 ).3. ( (d - 315)^2 = d^2 - 2 times 315 times d + 315^2 ).Now, adding all these together:[315^2 + (315d - 315^2) + (d^2 - 630d + 315^2)]Let me simplify term by term:- The first term is ( 315^2 ).- The second term is ( 315d - 315^2 ).- The third term is ( d^2 - 630d + 315^2 ).Now, adding them together:- ( 315^2 + 315d - 315^2 + d^2 - 630d + 315^2 )Let me combine like terms:- ( 315^2 - 315^2 + 315^2 = 315^2 )- ( 315d - 630d = -315d )- The remaining term is ( d^2 )So, putting it all together:[d^2 - 315d + 315^2]Therefore, the expression simplifies to ( d^2 - 315d + 315^2 ). So, we have:[d mid d^2 - 315d + 315^2]Which means that ( d ) divides ( d^2 - 315d + 315^2 ). Let me write this as:[d mid (d^2 - 315d + 315^2)]But ( d ) divides ( d^2 ), ( d ) divides ( -315d ), and ( d ) divides ( 315^2 ) only if ( d ) is a divisor of ( 315^2 ). Wait, no, actually, let me think again.If ( d ) divides ( d^2 - 315d + 315^2 ), then ( d ) must divide the entire expression. Since ( d ) divides ( d^2 ) and ( d ) divides ( -315d ), it must also divide the constant term ( 315^2 ). So, ( d ) must be a divisor of ( 315^2 ).Therefore, ( d ) is a positive divisor of ( 315^2 ). Since ( d = 315 + n ), and ( n ) is a positive integer, ( d ) must be greater than 315. So, we need to find the smallest ( d > 315 ) such that ( d ) divides ( 315^2 ), and then ( n = d - 315 ) will be the smallest positive integer satisfying the original condition.So, the problem reduces to finding the smallest divisor ( d ) of ( 315^2 ) that is greater than 315, and then subtracting 315 from it to get ( n ).Therefore, I need to factorize ( 315^2 ) and find its divisors greater than 315, then pick the smallest one.First, let's factorize 315.315 is equal to 5 × 63, which is 5 × 7 × 9, which is 5 × 7 × 3^2. So, prime factorization of 315 is ( 3^2 times 5 times 7 ).Therefore, ( 315^2 = (3^2 times 5 times 7)^2 = 3^4 times 5^2 times 7^2 ).The number of divisors of ( 315^2 ) is (4 + 1)(2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 5 × 3 × 3 = 45. So, 45 divisors in total.Now, since we need the smallest divisor greater than 315, we can find the smallest divisor greater than 315 by looking at the factors of ( 315^2 ).But instead of listing all 45 divisors, which would be time-consuming, perhaps we can find the smallest divisor greater than 315 by considering the properties of divisors.Note that for any number ( m ), the smallest divisor greater than ( sqrt{m} ) is the smallest prime factor of ( m ) greater than ( sqrt{m} ). Wait, actually, that might not always be the case. Alternatively, the smallest divisor greater than ( sqrt{m} ) is the smallest prime factor of ( m ) greater than ( sqrt{m} ), but if ( m ) is a perfect square, then ( sqrt{m} ) is an integer, and the next divisor after ( sqrt{m} ) would be the smallest prime factor greater than ( sqrt{m} ).But in this case, ( 315^2 ) is a perfect square, so ( sqrt{315^2} = 315 ). Therefore, the smallest divisor greater than 315 would be the smallest prime factor of ( 315^2 ) that is greater than 315. But wait, 315 is 3^2 × 5 × 7, so the prime factors are 3, 5, 7.But 3, 5, 7 are all less than 315, so the next smallest divisor greater than 315 would be the smallest composite divisor greater than 315.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the divisors of ( 315^2 ). Since ( 315^2 ) is 3^4 × 5^2 × 7^2, its divisors are of the form 3^a × 5^b × 7^c, where a ≤ 4, b ≤ 2, c ≤ 2.We need the smallest divisor greater than 315.So, let's find the smallest divisor of ( 315^2 ) that is greater than 315.One approach is to find the smallest number greater than 315 that divides ( 315^2 ). Since 315 is 3^2 × 5 × 7, ( 315^2 ) is 3^4 × 5^2 × 7^2.So, let's try to find the smallest multiple of 315 that is a divisor of ( 315^2 ). Wait, 315 × 2 = 630. Is 630 a divisor of ( 315^2 )?Yes, because ( 315^2 = 315 × 315 ), so 630 = 2 × 315, and since 2 is a factor, 630 divides ( 315^2 ). So, 630 is a divisor of ( 315^2 ), and it's greater than 315.Is there a divisor between 315 and 630? Let's check.Looking for the smallest divisor greater than 315. Let's see.Divisors of ( 315^2 ) come in pairs multiplying to ( 315^2 ). So, for each divisor less than 315, there is a corresponding divisor greater than 315. So, the smallest divisor greater than 315 would correspond to the largest divisor less than 315.Wait, but since 315 is the square root, the smallest divisor greater than 315 is the smallest prime factor greater than 315, but since 315 is not prime, and all its prime factors are less than 315, the next smallest divisor would be the next multiple.Wait, perhaps 315 × (next prime factor). But 315's prime factors are 3, 5, 7. So, the next multiple would be 315 × 3 = 945, which is larger than 630. So, 630 is smaller than 945.Wait, but 630 is 2 × 315, and 2 is a prime factor. So, 2 is a prime factor of 315^2, since 315^2 includes 3^4 × 5^2 × 7^2, but 2 is not a prime factor. Wait, hold on, 315 is 3^2 × 5 × 7, so 315^2 is 3^4 × 5^2 × 7^2. So, 2 is not a prime factor of 315^2. Therefore, 630 is not a divisor of 315^2 because 630 = 2 × 3^2 × 5 × 7, and 2 is not a factor of 315^2.Wait, hold on, that's a mistake. 315^2 is 3^4 × 5^2 × 7^2. So, 630 is 2 × 3^2 × 5 × 7. Since 2 is not a factor of 315^2, 630 cannot divide 315^2. So, 630 is not a divisor.So, my earlier thought was wrong. 630 is not a divisor because 2 is not a factor.Therefore, I need to find the smallest divisor of ( 315^2 ) greater than 315, without introducing new prime factors.So, since ( 315^2 ) is 3^4 × 5^2 × 7^2, any divisor must be a product of these primes with exponents not exceeding their respective exponents in the prime factorization.So, to find the smallest divisor greater than 315, let's think about how to construct such a divisor.Given that 315 is 3^2 × 5 × 7, to get a divisor greater than 315, we can try increasing the exponents of the primes in the factorization.Let me list the possible divisors just above 315.One way is to take 315 and multiply it by the smallest possible factor from the prime factors.Since 315 is 3^2 × 5 × 7, multiplying it by 3 would give 3^3 × 5 × 7, which is 3 × 315 = 945.Multiplying by 5 would give 5 × 315 = 1575.Multiplying by 7 would give 7 × 315 = 2205.But 945, 1575, 2205 are all larger than 315, but perhaps there are smaller divisors.Alternatively, maybe we can find a divisor by increasing the exponents of the primes in 315's factorization without multiplying by the entire prime.For example, 315 has 3^2, 5^1, 7^1.If we increase the exponent of 3 to 3, keeping 5 and 7 the same, we get 3^3 × 5 × 7 = 27 × 5 × 7 = 945.If we increase the exponent of 5 to 2, keeping 3 and 7 the same, we get 3^2 × 5^2 × 7 = 9 × 25 × 7 = 1575.If we increase the exponent of 7 to 2, keeping 3 and 5 the same, we get 3^2 × 5 × 7^2 = 9 × 5 × 49 = 2205.Alternatively, maybe we can increase two exponents at the same time but in a way that the product is still less than 945.Wait, let's see.Suppose we take 3^2 × 5^2 × 7 = 9 × 25 × 7 = 1575, which is larger than 945.Alternatively, 3^3 × 5 × 7 = 945, as above.Alternatively, 3^2 × 5 × 7^2 = 2205.Alternatively, perhaps a combination of exponents.Wait, maybe 3^3 × 5^1 × 7^1 = 945.Alternatively, 3^2 × 5^2 × 7^1 = 1575.Alternatively, 3^2 × 5^1 × 7^2 = 2205.Alternatively, 3^4 × 5^1 × 7^1 = 81 × 5 × 7 = 2835.Wait, so 945 is the smallest multiple of 315 by a prime factor, but 945 is 315 × 3.But is there a divisor of 315^2 that is between 315 and 945?Let me think. Since 315^2 = 99225.So, the divisors of 99225 are all numbers of the form 3^a × 5^b × 7^c, where a ≤ 4, b ≤ 2, c ≤ 2.We need the smallest such number greater than 315.So, let's try to find the minimal d > 315, d divides 99225.So, perhaps starting from 315, we can look for the next divisor.Alternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal d > 315 such that d divides 99225.To find the minimal d, perhaps we can look for the smallest multiple of the prime factors beyond 315.But since 315 is 3^2 × 5 × 7, let's see.What is 315 multiplied by 3? 945.But maybe a smaller multiple exists.Wait, perhaps 315 × (3/ something). Wait, no, because 315 is already an integer.Alternatively, maybe 315 × (5/ something). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps 315 + k, where k is minimal such that 315 + k divides 99225.But that might not be straightforward.Alternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal d > 315 such that d divides 99225.So, let's list the divisors of 99225 just above 315.To do this, perhaps we can factorize 99225 and list the divisors.But 99225 is 315^2, which is (3^2 × 5 × 7)^2 = 3^4 × 5^2 × 7^2.Therefore, the exponents for 3 are 0 to 4, for 5 are 0 to 2, and for 7 are 0 to 2.So, the number of divisors is (4 + 1)(2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 5 × 3 × 3 = 45.So, 45 divisors in total.To find the smallest divisor greater than 315, we can list the divisors just above 315.Alternatively, perhaps we can note that the smallest divisor greater than 315 is equal to 315 multiplied by the smallest prime factor of 315^2 / 315, which is 315.Wait, 315^2 / 315 = 315. So, that approach might not help.Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the divisors as pairs multiplying to 315^2.So, for each divisor d less than 315, there is a corresponding divisor 315^2 / d greater than 315.Therefore, the smallest divisor greater than 315 is equal to 315^2 divided by the largest divisor less than 315.So, if we can find the largest divisor of 315^2 less than 315, then 315^2 divided by that will give us the smallest divisor greater than 315.Therefore, let's find the largest divisor of 315^2 less than 315.Since 315 is 3^2 × 5 × 7, the largest divisor less than 315 would be 315 divided by its smallest prime factor.The smallest prime factor of 315 is 3, so 315 / 3 = 105.Wait, but 105 is less than 315, but is 105 the largest divisor less than 315? No, because 315 has larger divisors less than itself.Wait, for example, 315 / 1 = 315, but we need divisors less than 315.Wait, perhaps the largest proper divisor of 315 is 315 / smallest prime factor.So, 315 / 3 = 105, but 105 is not the largest proper divisor.Wait, 315's divisors include numbers like 105, 63, 45, etc. Wait, let's list the divisors of 315.Wait, 315 is 3^2 × 5 × 7, so its divisors are all numbers of the form 3^a × 5^b × 7^c, where a ≤ 2, b ≤ 1, c ≤ 1.So, the divisors are:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 21, 35, 45, 63, 105, 315.So, the largest proper divisor of 315 is 105.Therefore, the largest divisor less than 315 is 105.Therefore, the smallest divisor greater than 315 is 315^2 / 105 = (315 × 315) / 105 = 315 × 3 = 945.Wait, so 945 is the smallest divisor of 315^2 greater than 315.Therefore, ( d = 945 ), so ( n = d - 315 = 945 - 315 = 630 ).Wait, but earlier I thought 630 wasn't a divisor because 2 isn't a factor, but 945 is 315 × 3, which is a divisor.But wait, let me confirm: 315^2 is 99225.Dividing 99225 by 945: 99225 ÷ 945.Let me compute that.945 × 100 = 94,50099,225 - 94,500 = 4,725945 × 5 = 4,725So, 945 × 105 = 99,225.Therefore, 945 is indeed a divisor.So, the smallest divisor greater than 315 is 945, so ( n = 945 - 315 = 630 ).But wait, earlier I thought 630 wasn't a divisor because 2 isn't a factor, but 630 is 2 × 315, but 2 isn't a factor of 315^2, so 630 can't be a divisor.But according to this, 945 is the smallest divisor greater than 315, so n is 630.But wait, 630 is 2 × 315, but 2 is not a factor of 315^2, so 630 cannot divide 315^2.Wait, but 945 is 3 × 315, and 3 is a factor, so 945 divides 315^2.So, perhaps 630 is not a divisor, but 945 is.Therefore, the minimal ( d ) is 945, hence ( n = 630 ).But wait, let me check: if ( d = 945 ), then ( n = 945 - 315 = 630 ).But let's verify whether ( 315^2 - n^2 ) divides ( 315^3 - n^3 ).Compute ( 315^2 - 630^2 ) and ( 315^3 - 630^3 ).Wait, but 630 is larger than 315, so ( 315^2 - 630^2 ) is negative, but divisibility is regardless of sign, so we can take absolute values.Compute ( |315^2 - 630^2| = |(315 - 630)(315 + 630)| = |(-315)(945)| = 315 × 945.Compute ( |315^3 - 630^3| = |(315 - 630)(315^2 + 315×630 + 630^2)| = |(-315)(315^2 + 315×630 + 630^2)| = 315 × (315^2 + 315×630 + 630^2).So, does 315 × 945 divide 315 × (315^2 + 315×630 + 630^2)?Yes, because 315 is a common factor, and 945 divides the remaining part.Wait, but 945 is 315 × 3, so 945 divides 315^2 + 315×630 + 630^2?Wait, let me compute ( 315^2 + 315×630 + 630^2 ).Compute each term:- ( 315^2 = 99225 )- ( 315 × 630 = 315 × 630 = let's compute 315 × 600 = 189,000 and 315 × 30 = 9,450, so total is 198,450- ( 630^2 = 396,900 )Adding them together: 99,225 + 198,450 + 396,900.Compute 99,225 + 198,450 = 297,675297,675 + 396,900 = 694,575So, ( 315^2 + 315×630 + 630^2 = 694,575 )Now, does 945 divide 694,575?Compute 694,575 ÷ 945.Let me compute 945 × 700 = 661,500Subtract from 694,575: 694,575 - 661,500 = 33,075Now, 945 × 35 = 33,075So, 945 × 735 = 694,575Therefore, 945 divides 694,575 exactly 735 times.Therefore, 315 × 945 divides 315 × 694,575, which is 315^3 - 630^3.So, yes, 315^2 - 630^2 divides 315^3 - 630^3.Therefore, ( n = 630 ) is a solution.But wait, is 630 the smallest such positive integer?Earlier, I thought that 630 was not a divisor because 2 is not a factor, but actually, 630 is not a divisor of 315^2, but ( d = 945 ) is a divisor, and ( n = d - 315 = 630 ).But perhaps there is a smaller ( n ) such that ( d = 315 + n ) is a divisor of 315^2.Wait, but according to the earlier logic, the smallest ( d ) greater than 315 is 945, so ( n = 630 ) is the minimal.But let me check if there are any divisors between 315 and 945.Wait, 315^2 is 99225.Let me check if 405 is a divisor: 405 × 245 = 99,225? Let's see: 405 × 200 = 81,000; 405 × 45 = 18,225; total is 99,225. So, 405 × 245 = 99,225.Therefore, 405 is a divisor of 99,225.So, 405 is a divisor greater than 315.Wait, so 405 is smaller than 945, so 405 is a divisor.Therefore, ( d = 405 ), so ( n = 405 - 315 = 90 ).Wait, so 90 is smaller than 630, so perhaps 90 is a solution.But let me verify.Compute ( 315^2 - 90^2 ) and see if it divides ( 315^3 - 90^3 ).First, ( 315^2 - 90^2 = (315 - 90)(315 + 90) = 225 × 405 = 91,125 ).Compute ( 315^3 - 90^3 ). Let me compute 315^3 first.315^3 = 315 × 315 × 315.We already know 315^2 = 99,225.So, 315^3 = 99,225 × 315.Compute 99,225 × 300 = 29,767,50099,225 × 15 = 1,488,375Total: 29,767,500 + 1,488,375 = 31,255,875Similarly, 90^3 = 729,000So, ( 315^3 - 90^3 = 31,255,875 - 729,000 = 30,526,875 )Now, check if 91,125 divides 30,526,875.Compute 30,526,875 ÷ 91,125.Let me see: 91,125 × 300 = 27,337,500Subtract from 30,526,875: 30,526,875 - 27,337,500 = 3,189,375Now, 91,125 × 35 = 3,189,375So, total is 300 + 35 = 335.Therefore, 91,125 × 335 = 30,526,875.So, yes, 91,125 divides 30,526,875 exactly 335 times.Therefore, ( n = 90 ) is a solution.But 90 is smaller than 630, so perhaps 90 is the minimal.But wait, let's see if there are even smaller ( n ).Wait, let's check if 405 is indeed the smallest divisor greater than 315.Wait, 405 is 3^4 × 5, which is a divisor of 315^2.But is there a divisor between 315 and 405?For example, 315 + 1 = 316. Is 316 a divisor? 316 is 4 × 79. 79 is a prime not dividing 315^2, so 316 is not a divisor.317: prime, not a divisor.318: 318 = 2 × 3 × 53. 53 is not a factor, so no.319: 11 × 29, neither divides 315^2.320: 2^6 × 5, 2 is not a factor, so no.321: 3 × 107, 107 is prime, not a factor.322: 2 × 7 × 23, 23 is not a factor.323: 17 × 19, nope.324: 18^2 = 2^2 × 3^4. 2 is not a factor, so no.325: 5^2 × 13, 13 is not a factor.326: 2 × 163, nope.327: 3 × 109, nope.328: 8 × 41, nope.329: 7 × 47, nope.330: 2 × 3 × 5 × 11, 11 is not a factor.331: prime, nope.332: 4 × 83, nope.333: 3 × 111 = 3 × 3 × 37, 37 is not a factor.334: 2 × 167, nope.335: 5 × 67, nope.336: 16 × 21 = 2^4 × 3 × 7, 2 is not a factor.337: prime, nope.338: 2 × 13^2, nope.339: 3 × 113, nope.340: 4 × 5 × 17, nope.341: 11 × 31, nope.342: 2 × 3^2 × 19, nope.343: 7^3, but 315^2 only has 7^2, so 343 is not a divisor.344: 8 × 43, nope.345: 5 × 69 = 5 × 3 × 23, nope.346: 2 × 173, nope.347: prime, nope.348: 4 × 87 = 4 × 3 × 29, nope.349: prime, nope.350: 2 × 5^2 × 7, 2 is not a factor.351: 3^3 × 13, nope.352: 16 × 22, nope.353: prime, nope.354: 2 × 3 × 59, nope.355: 5 × 71, nope.356: 4 × 89, nope.357: 3 × 7 × 17, nope.358: 2 × 179, nope.359: prime, nope.360: 2^3 × 3^2 × 5, 2 is not a factor.361: 19^2, nope.362: 2 × 181, nope.363: 3 × 121 = 3 × 11^2, nope.364: 4 × 91 = 4 × 7 × 13, nope.365: 5 × 73, nope.366: 2 × 3 × 61, nope.367: prime, nope.368: 16 × 23, nope.369: 3 × 123 = 3 × 3 × 41, nope.370: 2 × 5 × 37, nope.371: 7 × 53, nope.372: 4 × 93 = 4 × 3 × 31, nope.373: prime, nope.374: 2 × 11 × 17, nope.375: 3 × 5^3, but 315^2 only has 5^2, so no.376: 8 × 47, nope.377: 13 × 29, nope.378: 2 × 3^3 × 7, 2 is not a factor.379: prime, nope.380: 4 × 5 × 19, nope.381: 3 × 127, nope.382: 2 × 191, nope.383: prime, nope.384: 2^7 × 3, nope.385: 5 × 7 × 11, nope.386: 2 × 193, nope.387: 3 × 129 = 3 × 3 × 43, nope.388: 4 × 97, nope.389: prime, nope.390: 2 × 3 × 5 × 13, nope.391: 17 × 23, nope.392: 4 × 98 = 4 × 2 × 49 = 2^3 × 7^2, 2 is not a factor.393: 3 × 131, nope.394: 2 × 197, nope.395: 5 × 79, nope.396: 4 × 99 = 4 × 9 × 11, nope.397: prime, nope.398: 2 × 199, nope.399: 3 × 133 = 3 × 7 × 19, nope.400: 2^4 × 5^2, 2 is not a factor.401: prime, nope.402: 2 × 3 × 67, nope.403: 13 × 31, nope.404: 4 × 101, nope.405: 3^4 × 5, which is a divisor.So, indeed, the next divisor after 315 is 405.Therefore, ( d = 405 ), so ( n = 405 - 315 = 90 ).So, 90 is a smaller ( n ) that satisfies the condition.But wait, let me check if there are any divisors between 315 and 405.Wait, 315 × 3 = 945, which is larger than 405, so 405 is smaller.Wait, but 405 is 3^4 × 5, which is a divisor.Is there a divisor between 315 and 405?Wait, 315 × (5/ something). Wait, 315 × (5/3) = 525, which is larger than 405.Wait, 315 × (7/ something). 315 × (7/5) = 441, which is larger than 405.Wait, 315 × (something). Hmm, perhaps 315 × (something less than 1). But that would be less than 315.Alternatively, perhaps 315 + k, where k is minimal such that 315 + k divides 315^2.But as we saw earlier, 405 is the next divisor after 315.Therefore, 405 is the smallest divisor greater than 315, so ( n = 90 ) is the minimal.But let me check if 90 is indeed the minimal.Wait, let's see if there is a divisor between 315 and 405.Wait, 315 × 1.2 = 378, which is 315 + 63 = 378. Is 378 a divisor?378 is 2 × 3^3 × 7. 2 is not a factor of 315^2, so no.Similarly, 315 + 45 = 360, which is 2^3 × 3^2 × 5. 2 is not a factor, so no.315 + 30 = 345, which is 5 × 69 = 5 × 3 × 23. 23 is not a factor, so no.315 + 15 = 330, which is 2 × 3 × 5 × 11. 11 is not a factor, so no.315 + 9 = 324, which is 2^2 × 3^4. 2 is not a factor, so no.315 + 7 = 322, which is 2 × 7 × 23. 23 is not a factor.315 + 5 = 320, which is 2^6 × 5. 2 is not a factor.315 + 3 = 318, which is 2 × 3 × 53. 53 is not a factor.315 + 1 = 316, which is 4 × 79. 79 is not a factor.So, none of these numbers are divisors of 315^2.Therefore, the next divisor after 315 is indeed 405, so ( n = 90 ) is the minimal.But wait, let me check another approach.We had earlier that ( d = 315 + n ) must divide ( 315^2 + 315n + n^2 ).But since ( d = 315 + n ), we can write ( n = d - 315 ).Substituting into the expression:[315^2 + 315n + n^2 = 315^2 + 315(d - 315) + (d - 315)^2]Which simplifies to:[d^2 - 315d + 315^2]So, ( d ) divides ( d^2 - 315d + 315^2 ).Which implies that ( d ) divides ( 315^2 ).Therefore, ( d ) must be a divisor of ( 315^2 ).Hence, ( d ) must be a divisor of ( 315^2 ) greater than 315, as ( n ) is positive.Therefore, the minimal ( d ) is 405, leading to ( n = 90 ).But let me check if there is a smaller ( d ) that is a divisor of ( 315^2 ) greater than 315.Wait, 315^2 is 99225.Let me list the divisors of 99225 greater than 315 and find the smallest one.We can do this by considering the exponents in the prime factorization.Given that 99225 = 3^4 × 5^2 × 7^2.To find the smallest divisor greater than 315, we can look for the smallest combination of exponents that result in a number greater than 315.Since 315 is 3^2 × 5 × 7, to get a number greater than 315, we can try increasing one of the exponents.Let's try increasing the exponent of 3:- 3^3 × 5 × 7 = 27 × 5 × 7 = 945- 3^4 × 5 × 7 = 81 × 5 × 7 = 2835Alternatively, increasing the exponent of 5:- 3^2 × 5^2 × 7 = 9 × 25 × 7 = 1575Alternatively, increasing the exponent of 7:- 3^2 × 5 × 7^2 = 9 × 5 × 49 = 2205Alternatively, increasing two exponents:- 3^3 × 5^2 × 7 = 27 × 25 × 7 = 4725- 3^3 × 5 × 7^2 = 27 × 5 × 49 = 6615- 3^2 × 5^2 × 7^2 = 9 × 25 × 49 = 11025Alternatively, perhaps a combination with lower exponents.Wait, 3^2 × 5 × 7 × something.Wait, 3^2 × 5 × 7 × 3 = 3^3 × 5 × 7 = 945.Alternatively, 3^2 × 5 × 7 × 5 = 3^2 × 5^2 × 7 = 1575.Alternatively, 3^2 × 5 × 7 × 7 = 3^2 × 5 × 7^2 = 2205.Alternatively, 3^2 × 5 × 7 × 3 × 5 = 3^3 × 5^2 × 7 = 4725.Wait, but all these are larger than 405.Wait, but 405 is 3^4 × 5.So, 3^4 × 5 = 81 × 5 = 405.Which is less than 945.Therefore, 405 is a smaller divisor.Therefore, 405 is the smallest divisor greater than 315.Hence, ( n = 405 - 315 = 90 ).Therefore, the minimal ( n ) is 90.But wait, let me check if 405 is indeed the smallest divisor greater than 315.Looking back at the list of divisors, after 315, the next is 405, then 441, 525, 630, 675, 735, 945, etc.Wait, 441 is 21^2 = 3^2 × 7^2.Is 441 a divisor of 99225?Yes, because 99225 ÷ 441 = 225.So, 441 is a divisor.Therefore, 441 is smaller than 405? No, 441 is larger than 405.Wait, 405 is 405, 441 is 441, so 405 is smaller.Therefore, 405 is the next divisor after 315.Therefore, ( n = 90 ) is the minimal.But let me check if 90 is indeed the minimal.Wait, let's see if there is a divisor between 315 and 405.Wait, 315 × (something) = divisor.Wait, 315 × (3/2) = 472.5, which is not an integer.Alternatively, 315 × (5/4) = 393.75, not integer.Alternatively, 315 × (7/5) = 441, which is a divisor.But 441 is larger than 405.Wait, perhaps 315 × (something else).Alternatively, 315 × (something with exponents).Wait, 315 is 3^2 × 5 × 7.If we take 3^3 × 5 = 27 × 5 = 135, which is less than 315.Wait, no, 3^3 × 5 = 135, but 135 × 3 = 405.Wait, perhaps 3^4 × 5 = 81 × 5 = 405.Yes, that's how we get 405.Therefore, 405 is the next divisor after 315.Therefore, ( n = 90 ) is the minimal.But let me confirm by checking if ( n = 90 ) satisfies the original condition.Compute ( 315^2 - 90^2 = (315 - 90)(315 + 90) = 225 × 405 = 91,125 ).Compute ( 315^3 - 90^3 ).As before, ( 315^3 = 31,255,875 ), ( 90^3 = 729,000 ).So, ( 315^3 - 90^3 = 31,255,875 - 729,000 = 30,526,875 ).Now, check if 91,125 divides 30,526,875.Compute 30,526,875 ÷ 91,125.As before, 91,125 × 335 = 30,526,875.Therefore, yes, 91,125 divides 30,526,875.Therefore, ( n = 90 ) is a solution.But is there a smaller ( n )?Wait, let's see if there is a divisor of 315^2 between 315 and 405.Wait, 315 × 1.333... = 420, which is 315 + 105 = 420.Is 420 a divisor?420 is 2^2 × 3 × 5 × 7. 2 is not a factor, so no.Similarly, 315 + 90 = 405, which is a divisor.Therefore, 405 is the next divisor after 315.Therefore, ( n = 90 ) is the minimal.But wait, let me check if 90 is indeed the minimal.Wait, let's think differently.We have ( d = 315 + n ) divides ( 315^2 + 315n + n^2 ).But since ( d = 315 + n ), we can write ( n = d - 315 ).Substituting into the expression:[315^2 + 315n + n^2 = 315^2 + 315(d - 315) + (d - 315)^2]Simplify:[315^2 + 315d - 315^2 + d^2 - 630d + 315^2 = d^2 - 315d + 315^2]Therefore, ( d ) divides ( d^2 - 315d + 315^2 ).Which implies ( d ) divides ( 315^2 ).Hence, ( d ) must be a divisor of ( 315^2 ).Therefore, the minimal ( d ) greater than 315 is 405, so ( n = 90 ).Therefore, the minimal positive integer ( n ) is 90.But wait, let me check if 90 is indeed the minimal.Wait, let me see if there is a divisor of 315^2 between 315 and 405.Wait, 315 × 1.333... = 420, which is not a divisor.315 × 1.2857 ≈ 405.But 405 is the next divisor.Therefore, 405 is the minimal ( d ), so ( n = 90 ).Therefore, the answer is ( boxed{90} )."},{"question":"In a mathematics competition, 1000 students are numbered as follows: 0001, 0002, 0003, ..., 1000.

There are 1000 students numbered from 0001 to 1000. They need to take a sample of size 50 using systematic sampling. The method divides them into 50 parts, and the first part has numbers 0001 to 0020. They randomly selected number 0010 from the first part, and now they want to know what the 41st number is.Hmm, let me recall what systematic sampling is. From what I remember, systematic sampling is a method where you select every k-th element from a population. The key here is determining the interval k. Since there are 1000 students and they need a sample of 50, the interval k should be 1000 divided by 50, which is 20. So, k is 20.Wait, the problem says they divide them into 50 parts. Each part would then have 20 students because 1000 divided by 50 is 20. So, the first part is 0001 to 0020, the second part is 0021 to 0040, and so on until the 50th part, which would be 0981 to 1000.Now, in systematic sampling, once you determine the interval k, you randomly select a starting point between 1 and k. In this case, the starting point is randomly selected from the first part, which is 0001 to 0020. They selected 0010 as the starting point. So, the first number is 0010.Then, the next numbers would be every 20th number after that. So, the second number would be 0010 + 20 = 0030, the third would be 0030 + 20 = 0050, and so on.Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because in systematic sampling, sometimes the interval is calculated differently. Let me make sure.The formula for the interval k is N/n, where N is the population size and n is the sample size. So, 1000 divided by 50 is indeed 20. So, k is 20. So, starting from a random number between 1 and 20, which is 10 in this case, the next numbers are 10 + 20, 10 + 40, etc.So, the first number is 10, the second is 30, the third is 50, and so on. So, the 41st number would be 10 + (41 - 1)*20. Let me compute that.First, (41 - 1) is 40. So, 40 multiplied by 20 is 800. Then, adding the starting point 10, we get 810. So, the 41st number is 0810.Wait, but let me check if that makes sense. So, the first number is 10, the second is 30, third is 50, ..., 40th would be 10 + 39*20 = 10 + 780 = 790. Then, the 41st would be 790 + 20 = 810. That seems right.But let me think again. Sometimes, in systematic sampling, especially when the population size isn't a multiple of the sample size, you might have to adjust. But in this case, 1000 is exactly 50 times 20, so it's straightforward. So, no adjustment is needed here.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each part has 20 numbers, and since we're taking one from each part, starting from the 10th number in the first part, then the next would be the 10th number in the second part, which is 0020 + 10 = 0030, and so on.Wait, that actually aligns with the previous method. So, the 1st number is 10, the second is 30, third is 50, etc. So, the 41st number would be 10 + (41 - 1)*20 = 810.But let me make sure that the counting is correct. So, if the first number is 10, then the second is 30, which is 10 + 20, the third is 50, which is 30 + 20, so each time adding 20. So, the nth number is 10 + (n - 1)*20.So, for n = 41, it's 10 + 40*20 = 10 + 800 = 810. So, 0810 is the number.But wait, let me think about the numbering. The students are numbered from 0001 to 1000, so 0810 is a valid number. But is it 0810 or 810? In the problem statement, they use four-digit numbering, so 0810 is correct.Alternatively, if they had numbered them as 1 to 1000 without leading zeros, it would be 810, but since they are using four digits, it's 0810.So, I think 0810 is the correct answer.Wait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake with the starting point. So, the first part is 0001 to 0020, and they selected 0010. So, the next part is 0021 to 0040, so the next number would be 0021 + 9 = 0030? Wait, no. Wait, if the first number is 0010, then the next number is 0010 + 20 = 0030, which is in the second part.Wait, but 0010 is in the first part, 0030 is in the second part, 0050 in the third, and so on. So, each subsequent number is 20 apart. So, the 41st number is 0010 + (41 - 1)*20 = 0010 + 800 = 0810.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the first number is 10, so the sequence is 10, 30, 50, ..., up to 10 + 20*(n-1). So, for n=41, it's 10 + 20*40 = 10 + 800 = 810.So, 0810 is the 41st number.I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 0810.**Final Answer**The 41st number is boxed{0810}."},{"question":"Someone rows a boat for 15 miles. At his usual speed, rowing downstream takes 5 hours less than upstream. At twice his usual speed, rowing downstream takes only 1 hour less than upstream. Calculate the speed of the water current in miles per hour.(A) 2(B) frac{5}{2}(C) 3(D) frac{7}{2}(E) 4","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where someone is rowing a boat for 15 miles. The problem says that at his usual speed, rowing downstream takes 5 hours less than upstream. Then, when he rows at twice his usual speed, downstream takes only 1 hour less than upstream. I need to find the speed of the water current in miles per hour. The options are given, so that might help if I get stuck, but I should try to solve it myself first.Let me start by understanding the problem. When rowing downstream, the current helps him, so his effective speed is increased. When rowing upstream, he has to work against the current, so his effective speed is decreased. The distance is the same in both cases, 15 miles.Let me denote the rower's usual speed in still water as 'r' miles per hour, and the speed of the current as 'c' miles per hour. So, when he is going downstream, his effective speed is (r + c) mph, and when going upstream, it's (r - c) mph.The time taken to go downstream would be the distance divided by the downstream speed, so that's 15 / (r + c) hours. Similarly, the time upstream is 15 / (r - c) hours.According to the problem, at his usual speed, downstream takes 5 hours less than upstream. So, I can write the equation:15 / (r - c) - 15 / (r + c) = 5That's my first equation.Now, when he rows at twice his usual speed, his speed in still water becomes 2r mph. So, downstream speed becomes (2r + c) mph, and upstream speed becomes (2r - c) mph. The times taken would then be 15 / (2r + c) hours downstream and 15 / (2r - c) hours upstream.The problem states that at this doubled speed, downstream takes only 1 hour less than upstream. So, the equation is:15 / (2r - c) - 15 / (2r + c) = 1That's my second equation.So now I have two equations:1) 15 / (r - c) - 15 / (r + c) = 52) 15 / (2r - c) - 15 / (2r + c) = 1I need to solve these two equations to find the value of 'c', the speed of the current.Let me first simplify the first equation. Let's denote equation 1 as:15/(r - c) - 15/(r + c) = 5I can factor out the 15:15[1/(r - c) - 1/(r + c)] = 5Divide both sides by 15:[1/(r - c) - 1/(r + c)] = 5/15 = 1/3Now, compute the left side:1/(r - c) - 1/(r + c) = [ (r + c) - (r - c) ] / [ (r - c)(r + c) ] = [2c] / [r² - c²]So, 2c / (r² - c²) = 1/3So, equation 1 simplifies to:2c / (r² - c²) = 1/3Similarly, let's simplify equation 2:15/(2r - c) - 15/(2r + c) = 1Factor out 15:15[1/(2r - c) - 1/(2r + c)] = 1Divide both sides by 15:[1/(2r - c) - 1/(2r + c)] = 1/15Compute the left side:1/(2r - c) - 1/(2r + c) = [ (2r + c) - (2r - c) ] / [ (2r - c)(2r + c) ] = [2c] / [4r² - c²]So, 2c / (4r² - c²) = 1/15So, equation 2 simplifies to:2c / (4r² - c²) = 1/15Now, I have two equations:1) 2c / (r² - c²) = 1/32) 2c / (4r² - c²) = 1/15Let me write them again:Equation 1: 2c = (1/3)(r² - c²)Equation 2: 2c = (1/15)(4r² - c²)So, both equal to 2c, so I can set them equal to each other:(1/3)(r² - c²) = (1/15)(4r² - c²)Multiply both sides by 15 to eliminate denominators:5(r² - c²) = (4r² - c²)Expand the left side:5r² - 5c² = 4r² - c²Bring all terms to the left side:5r² - 5c² - 4r² + c² = 0Simplify:(5r² - 4r²) + (-5c² + c²) = 0Which is:r² - 4c² = 0So, r² = 4c²Therefore, r = 2c or r = -2cBut since speed can't be negative, r = 2cSo, the rower's usual speed is twice the speed of the current.Now, let's substitute r = 2c into one of the earlier equations. Let's take equation 1:2c = (1/3)(r² - c²)Substitute r = 2c:2c = (1/3)( (2c)² - c² ) = (1/3)(4c² - c²) = (1/3)(3c²) = c²So, 2c = c²Bring all terms to one side:c² - 2c = 0Factor:c(c - 2) = 0So, c = 0 or c = 2But c can't be 0 because then there would be no current, and the times downstream and upstream would be the same, which contradicts the problem statement. So, c = 2.Wait, but let me check if this is correct because 2 is one of the options, option A. But let me verify with equation 2 to make sure.From equation 2: 2c = (1/15)(4r² - c²)Again, substitute r = 2c:2c = (1/15)(4*(2c)^2 - c²) = (1/15)(16c² - c²) = (1/15)(15c²) = c²So, 2c = c², same as before, leading to c = 2.So, the current speed is 2 mph. So, answer is A) 2.But wait, let me just think again because sometimes in these problems, it's easy to make a mistake in setting up equations.Wait, so if c = 2, then r = 2c = 4 mph.Let me compute the times.At usual speed:Downstream speed: r + c = 4 + 2 = 6 mph. Time = 15 / 6 = 2.5 hours.Upstream speed: r - c = 4 - 2 = 2 mph. Time = 15 / 2 = 7.5 hours.Difference: 7.5 - 2.5 = 5 hours. That matches the first condition.At twice the speed:Rowing speed becomes 2r = 8 mph.Downstream speed: 8 + 2 = 10 mph. Time = 15 / 10 = 1.5 hours.Upstream speed: 8 - 2 = 6 mph. Time = 15 / 6 = 2.5 hours.Difference: 2.5 - 1.5 = 1 hour. That matches the second condition.So, both conditions are satisfied with c = 2.Therefore, the answer is 2 mph, which is option A.But wait, hold on, the options are:(A) 2(B) 5/2(C) 3(D) 7/2(E) 4So, 2 is option A. So, that's correct.But let me just think again because sometimes these problems can trick you.Wait, in the equations, when I set up the times, I assumed that downstream time is less than upstream time, so I subtracted downstream time from upstream time. Let me make sure that's correct.Yes, because the problem says \\"downstream takes 5 hours less than upstream\\", so upstream time - downstream time = 5. So, my equations are correct.Similarly, for the second condition, upstream time - downstream time = 1.So, equations were set up correctly.So, all steps seem correct, and the answer is 2 mph.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Find the value of the expressionleft(1+frac{1}{2}right)left(1-frac{1}{3}right)left(1+frac{1}{4}right)left(1-frac{1}{5}right) ldotsleft(1+frac{1}{2 m}right)left(1-frac{1}{2 m+1}right)","answer":"Alright, so I have this expression to evaluate:left(1+frac{1}{2}right)left(1-frac{1}{3}right)left(1+frac{1}{4}right)left(1-frac{1}{5}right) ldotsleft(1+frac{1}{2 m}right)left(1-frac{1}{2 m+1}right)Hmm, okay. It looks like a product of terms, alternating between addition and subtraction of reciprocals. Let me try to understand the pattern here.First, let's write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern or simplify it somehow.The first term is (1 + frac{1}{2}), which is (frac{3}{2}).The second term is (1 - frac{1}{3}), which is (frac{2}{3}).The third term is (1 + frac{1}{4}), which is (frac{5}{4}).The fourth term is (1 - frac{1}{5}), which is (frac{4}{5}).So, writing these out:frac{3}{2} times frac{2}{3} times frac{5}{4} times frac{4}{5} times ldotsWait a minute, this looks like a telescoping product! Each numerator cancels with the denominator of the next term.Let me check:First term: (frac{3}{2})Second term: (frac{2}{3})Multiplying these two: (frac{3}{2} times frac{2}{3} = 1)Third term: (frac{5}{4})Fourth term: (frac{4}{5})Multiplying these two: (frac{5}{4} times frac{4}{5} = 1)So, each pair of terms multiplies to 1. That's interesting.So, if each pair is 1, then the entire product up to (2m) terms would be 1 multiplied by itself (m) times, which is still 1. But wait, let me make sure.Wait, actually, the number of terms is (2m), right? Because each pair is two terms, so for each (m), we have two terms: (1 + frac{1}{2k}) and (1 - frac{1}{2k+1}), for (k) from 1 to (m).So, the product is:prod_{k=1}^{m} left(1 + frac{1}{2k}right)left(1 - frac{1}{2k+1}right)But as we saw, each pair multiplies to 1. So, the entire product would be 1.But wait, let me test this with a small (m). Let's take (m=1):Product is (left(1 + frac{1}{2}right)left(1 - frac{1}{3}right) = frac{3}{2} times frac{2}{3} = 1). Okay, that works.For (m=2):Product is (left(1 + frac{1}{2}right)left(1 - frac{1}{3}right)left(1 + frac{1}{4}right)left(1 - frac{1}{5}right) = frac{3}{2} times frac{2}{3} times frac{5}{4} times frac{4}{5} = 1 times 1 = 1). Still 1.Wait, so is the product always 1 regardless of (m)? That seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.Let me try (m=3):Product is:(left(1 + frac{1}{2}right)left(1 - frac{1}{3}right)left(1 + frac{1}{4}right)left(1 - frac{1}{5}right)left(1 + frac{1}{6}right)left(1 - frac{1}{7}right))Calculating step by step:First pair: (frac{3}{2} times frac{2}{3} = 1)Second pair: (frac{5}{4} times frac{4}{5} = 1)Third pair: (frac{7}{6} times frac{6}{7} = 1)So, total product is (1 times 1 times 1 = 1). Hmm, still 1.Wait, so does this mean that no matter how many pairs we have, as long as they follow this pattern, the product is always 1?But let me think about the general term. Each term is (left(1 + frac{1}{2k}right)left(1 - frac{1}{2k+1}right)).Let me compute this product for a general (k):Compute (left(1 + frac{1}{2k}right)left(1 - frac{1}{2k+1}right)).First, expand the terms:(1 times 1 = 1)(1 times (-frac{1}{2k+1}) = -frac{1}{2k+1})(frac{1}{2k} times 1 = frac{1}{2k})(frac{1}{2k} times (-frac{1}{2k+1}) = -frac{1}{2k(2k+1)})So, adding all these together:(1 - frac{1}{2k+1} + frac{1}{2k} - frac{1}{2k(2k+1)})Let me combine the terms:First, (1) remains.Then, the terms with (-frac{1}{2k+1}) and (frac{1}{2k}):Let me write them as (frac{1}{2k} - frac{1}{2k+1}).This is equal to (frac{(2k+1) - 2k}{2k(2k+1)} = frac{1}{2k(2k+1)}).So, the entire expression becomes:(1 + frac{1}{2k(2k+1)} - frac{1}{2k(2k+1)} = 1).Wait, so each pair actually simplifies to 1. That's why when we multiply them, each pair contributes a factor of 1, so the entire product is 1.Therefore, regardless of the value of (m), the product is always 1.But just to be thorough, let me test with (m=4):Product is:(left(1 + frac{1}{2}right)left(1 - frac{1}{3}right)left(1 + frac{1}{4}right)left(1 - frac{1}{5}right)left(1 + frac{1}{6}right)left(1 - frac{1}{7}right)left(1 + frac{1}{8}right)left(1 - frac{1}{9}right))Calculating step by step:First pair: (frac{3}{2} times frac{2}{3} = 1)Second pair: (frac{5}{4} times frac{4}{5} = 1)Third pair: (frac{7}{6} times frac{6}{7} = 1)Fourth pair: (frac{9}{8} times frac{8}{9} = 1)Total product: (1 times 1 times 1 times 1 = 1). Yep, still 1.So, it seems consistent.

Every minute, Karlson erases two arbitrary numbers and writes their sum on the board, then eats a number of candies equal to the product of the two erased numbers. What is the maximum number of candies he could eat in 25 minutes?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where there are 25 ones on the board. Every minute, Karlson erases two arbitrary numbers and writes their sum on the board. Then, he eats a number of candies equal to the product of the two erased numbers. The question is asking for the maximum number of candies he could eat in 25 minutes.Hmm, okay. Let me try to understand this step by step. So, initially, there are 25 ones. Each minute, he combines two numbers into their sum and eats candies equal to their product. Since he does this for 25 minutes, I guess he reduces the count of numbers on the board by one each time. So, starting from 25 numbers, after 25 operations, there should be just one number left. That makes sense.Now, the goal is to maximize the total number of candies he eats. So, we need to figure out the order in which he should combine the numbers to get the highest possible sum of products.Let me think about how the product of two numbers affects the total. If I have two numbers, say a and b, their product is a*b. If I combine them, I get a new number a+b, and then in the next step, I can combine this with another number, say c, giving me (a+b)*c. The total candies eaten so far would be a*b + (a+b)*c.Wait, but actually, each time he combines two numbers, he eats candies equal to their product. So, the total candies would be the sum of all these products over the 25 operations.So, the problem reduces to finding the order of combining numbers such that the sum of all these pairwise products is maximized.I remember something about this from math problems. It might be related to the concept of maximizing the sum of products when combining numbers. I think the strategy is to combine the smallest numbers first because combining larger numbers later would contribute more to the total.Wait, actually, let me think again. If you combine two small numbers first, their product is small, but then you have a larger number which can be combined with another larger number later, resulting in a bigger product. So, perhaps combining the smallest numbers first allows you to build up larger numbers which can then be multiplied together for bigger products.Alternatively, maybe combining the largest numbers first would give a bigger product earlier on, but then you might not have as large numbers left for later. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.Let me try an example with a smaller number of ones to see which strategy works better.Suppose there are 3 ones on the board. Let's see what happens.Case 1: Combine 1 and 1 first. Product is 1*1=1. Now, the numbers are 2 and 1. Then, combine 2 and 1. Product is 2*1=2. Total candies eaten: 1 + 2 = 3.Case 2: Combine 1 and 1 first, same as above. Wait, in this case, regardless of the order, it's the same. Hmm, maybe with 3 ones, both orders give the same result.Wait, maybe let's try 4 ones.Case 1: Combine 1 and 1, product=1. Now, numbers are 2,1,1.Then combine 1 and 1, product=1. Now, numbers are 2,2.Then combine 2 and 2, product=4. Total candies: 1+1+4=6.Case 2: Combine 1 and 1, product=1. Then combine 2 and 1, product=2. Then combine 3 and 1, product=3. Total candies: 1+2+3=6.Same result. Hmm, so maybe for 4 ones, both orders give the same.Wait, maybe I need a different approach.I remember that the total number of candies eaten is equal to the sum of all the products of the pairs combined. But actually, in the end, the final number on the board is the sum of all the initial ones, which is 25. So, the final number is fixed, regardless of the order.But the total candies eaten depend on the order of combination.Wait, perhaps this is similar to the concept of building a Huffman tree, where combining smaller numbers first leads to a higher total cost. Or maybe it's the opposite.Wait, actually, in Huffman coding, you combine the two smallest frequencies to minimize the total cost. But in this case, we want to maximize the total cost. So, perhaps we need to do the opposite: combine the two largest numbers first.Wait, let me think.Suppose I have numbers a and b, and I combine them. The product is a*b. Then, if I have another number c, combining a+b with c gives (a+b)*c. So, the total is a*b + (a+b)*c = a*b + a*c + b*c.Alternatively, if I first combine a and c, then combine the result with b, I get a*c + (a+c)*b = a*c + a*b + b*c. So, same result.Wait, so regardless of the order, the total is the same? But that can't be, because in the problem, the order affects the total.Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.Wait, no, actually, in the case of three numbers, the total is the same regardless of the order. Because the total is a*b + a*c + b*c.But in the case of four numbers, let's see:Suppose we have numbers a, b, c, d.If we first combine a and b, then combine (a+b) with c, then combine ((a+b)+c) with d.Total candies: a*b + (a+b)*c + (a+b+c)*d.Alternatively, if we first combine a and b, then combine a and c, then combine the results.Wait, no, that's not possible because once you combine a and b, you only have three numbers: (a+b), c, d.Wait, perhaps another approach: in the first step, combine a and b, then combine (a+b) with c, then combine ((a+b)+c) with d.Total: a*b + (a+b)*c + (a+b+c)*d.Alternatively, first combine a and c, then combine (a+c) with b, then combine ((a+c)+b) with d.Total: a*c + (a+c)*b + (a+b+c)*d.Which is a*c + a*b + b*c + (a+b+c)*d.Wait, so the first term is either a*b or a*c, depending on the order.So, if a and b are smaller than a and c, then combining a and b first gives a smaller initial product, but then the subsequent products might be larger.Wait, but in the case of all ones, maybe the order doesn't matter because all the numbers are the same.Wait, let me test with four ones.Case 1:Combine 1 and 1: product=1. Now, numbers are 2,1,1.Combine 2 and 1: product=2. Now, numbers are 3,1.Combine 3 and 1: product=3. Total: 1+2+3=6.Case 2:Combine 1 and 1: product=1. Now, numbers are 2,1,1.Combine 1 and 1: product=1. Now, numbers are 2,2.Combine 2 and 2: product=4. Total: 1+1+4=6.Same result.Wait, so in both cases, the total is 6. So, maybe for four ones, the order doesn't matter.Wait, but let's try with five ones.Case 1:Combine 1 and 1: product=1. Numbers: 2,1,1,1.Combine 2 and 1: product=2. Numbers: 3,1,1.Combine 3 and 1: product=3. Numbers: 4,1.Combine 4 and 1: product=4. Total: 1+2+3+4=10.Case 2:Combine 1 and 1: product=1. Numbers: 2,1,1,1.Combine 1 and 1: product=1. Numbers: 2,2,1.Combine 2 and 2: product=4. Numbers: 4,1.Combine 4 and 1: product=4. Total: 1+1+4+4=10.Same result.Wait, so maybe regardless of the order, the total is the same? But that contradicts the initial problem statement, which implies that the order affects the total.Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.Wait, let me think about the total candies eaten. Each time, you combine two numbers, say x and y, and eat x*y candies. So, the total is the sum over all combinations of x*y.But in the end, the final number is 25, which is the sum of all the ones. So, the sum of all the numbers on the board is always 25, regardless of the order.But the total candies eaten is the sum of all the products x*y at each step.Wait, is there a mathematical formula that relates the sum of all products x*y to something else?Yes, actually, the sum of all products x*y over all combinations is equal to (sum x)^2 - sum x^2 all divided by 2.Wait, let me recall. The square of the sum is equal to the sum of squares plus twice the sum of products.So, (sum x)^2 = sum x^2 + 2 * sum_{i < j} x_i x_j.Therefore, sum_{i < j} x_i x_j = [ (sum x)^2 - sum x^2 ] / 2.So, in our case, the total candies eaten is equal to sum_{i < j} x_i x_j, which is [ (sum x)^2 - sum x^2 ] / 2.But in our problem, the sum x is fixed at 25, because we start with 25 ones and each operation replaces two numbers with their sum, so the total sum remains 25.Therefore, the total candies eaten is [25^2 - sum x^2] / 2.So, to maximize the total candies eaten, we need to minimize the sum of squares of the numbers on the board at each step.Wait, but how does the order of combination affect the sum of squares?Wait, actually, each time we combine two numbers x and y, replacing them with x+y. The sum of squares changes as follows:Before combination: x^2 + y^2.After combination: (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2.So, the change in sum of squares is (x + y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 2xy.Therefore, each combination increases the sum of squares by 2xy. Since we are eating xy candies, the total candies eaten is equal to the total increase in sum of squares divided by 2.But the initial sum of squares is 25 * 1^2 = 25.The final sum of squares is 25^2 = 625.So, the total increase in sum of squares is 625 - 25 = 600.Therefore, the total candies eaten is 600 / 2 = 300.Wait, so regardless of the order, the total candies eaten is always 300?But that can't be, because in the problem statement, it's asking for the maximum number of candies he could eat, implying that the order does matter.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.Let me double-check.The total candies eaten is the sum of all products x*y at each step.But according to the formula, this is equal to [ (sum x)^2 - sum x^2 ] / 2.Since sum x is fixed at 25, and sum x^2 starts at 25 and ends at 625, the total increase in sum x^2 is 600, so the total candies eaten is 600 / 2 = 300.Therefore, regardless of the order, the total candies eaten is always 300.But that contradicts the problem statement, which suggests that the order affects the total.Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.Wait, the problem says: \\"every minute, Karlson erases two arbitrary numbers and writes their sum on the board, then eats a number of candies equal to the product of the two erased numbers.\\"So, he does this 25 times, reducing the count from 25 to 1.But according to the formula, the total candies eaten is fixed at 300, regardless of the order.Therefore, the maximum number of candies he could eat is 300.But wait, let me think again.Wait, in the formula, the total candies eaten is [ (sum x)^2 - sum x^2 ] / 2.But in our case, the initial sum x^2 is 25, and the final sum x^2 is 625.So, the total increase is 600, so the total candies eaten is 600 / 2 = 300.Therefore, regardless of the order, the total is always 300.Therefore, the maximum number of candies he could eat is 300.But wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, let me test with a smaller number, say 3 ones.Initial sum x^2: 3.Final sum x^2: 9.Total increase: 6.Total candies eaten: 6 / 2 = 3.Which matches our earlier calculation.Similarly, for 4 ones:Initial sum x^2: 4.Final sum x^2: 16.Total increase: 12.Total candies eaten: 12 / 2 = 6.Which also matches our earlier calculation.So, for 25 ones, it's 25^2 - 25 = 625 - 25 = 600. Divided by 2 is 300.Therefore, regardless of the order, the total candies eaten is 300.So, the maximum number of candies he could eat is 300.But wait, the problem says \\"the maximum number of candies he could eat in 25 minutes.\\" So, is it 300?But I thought maybe the order affects it, but according to the formula, it doesn't.Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to trick us into thinking that the order matters, but actually, it doesn't.Therefore, the answer is 300.But let me think again.Wait, suppose we have two numbers, 1 and 1. If we combine them, we get 2, and eat 1 candy.Alternatively, if we have 1 and 2, combining them gives 3, and eats 2 candies.Wait, but in the first case, the total candies eaten is 1, and in the second case, it's 2.But in the formula, the total is fixed.Wait, no, because in the first case, we have only two numbers, so the total is 1.In the second case, if we have three numbers: 1,1,1.First, combine 1 and 1: eat 1, get 2,1.Then, combine 2 and 1: eat 2, get 3.Total eaten: 1 + 2 = 3.Alternatively, first combine 1 and 1: eat 1, get 2,1.Then, combine 1 and 1: eat 1, get 2,2.Then, combine 2 and 2: eat 4, get 4.Total eaten: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.Wait, but in the first case, with three numbers, the total is 3, and in the second case, it's 6.Wait, that contradicts the earlier formula.Wait, no, actually, in the first case, we only combined twice, but in the second case, we combined three times.Wait, no, in the problem statement, for 25 ones, he does 25 operations, reducing from 25 to 1.So, for three ones, he does two operations.Wait, in the first case, combining 1 and 1, then combining 2 and 1: total candies 1 + 2 = 3.In the second case, combining 1 and 1, then combining 1 and 1, then combining 2 and 2: but that's three operations, but starting from three ones, you can only do two operations.Wait, I think I made a mistake in the second case.Wait, starting with three ones: 1,1,1.First, combine 1 and 1: get 2,1. Candies eaten: 1.Second, combine 2 and 1: get 3. Candies eaten: 2.Total: 1 + 2 = 3.Alternatively, first combine 1 and 1: get 2,1. Candies eaten: 1.Then, combine 1 and 1: but wait, after the first combination, you have 2 and 1. So, you can't combine 1 and 1 again because there's only one 1 left.Wait, so actually, in the second case, you can't do that. So, regardless, the total is 3.Wait, so maybe my earlier thought was wrong. So, for three ones, the total is fixed at 3.Similarly, for four ones, the total is fixed at 6.Therefore, in general, for n ones, the total candies eaten is (n^2 - n)/2.Wait, for n=3: (9 - 3)/2 = 3.For n=4: (16 - 4)/2 = 6.For n=25: (625 - 25)/2 = 600 / 2 = 300.Therefore, regardless of the order, the total candies eaten is always 300.So, the maximum number of candies he could eat is 300.Therefore, the answer is 300.But wait, let me think again.Wait, the formula says that the total candies eaten is [ (sum x)^2 - sum x^2 ] / 2.But in our case, the initial sum x^2 is 25, and the final sum x^2 is 625.Therefore, the total increase is 600, so the total candies eaten is 600 / 2 = 300.Therefore, regardless of the order, the total is fixed.So, the maximum number of candies he could eat is 300.Therefore, the answer is 300.**Final Answer**The maximum number of candies Karlson could eat is boxed{300}."},{"question":"If each interior angle of a regular polygon is 135^{circ}, then the number of sides of this regular polygon is ____.","answer":"First, I recall that the formula for the measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon is given by:[text{Interior Angle} = frac{(n - 2) times 180^circ}{n}]Given that each interior angle is (135^circ), I can set up the equation:[frac{(n - 2) times 180^circ}{n} = 135^circ]To solve for (n), I'll multiply both sides of the equation by (n):[(n - 2) times 180^circ = 135^circ n]Expanding the left side gives:[180n - 360 = 135n]Next, I'll subtract (135n) from both sides to get:[45n - 360 = 0]Adding (360) to both sides:[45n = 360]Finally, dividing both sides by (45) yields:[n = 8]Therefore, the regular polygon has (8) sides."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, angle C=90^circ, AC=6 and BC=8.

Let me try to visualize it first. There's a right triangle ABC with a right angle at C. AC is 6 units, and BC is 8 units. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with legs 6 and 8. I remember that in such triangles, the hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let me calculate that first.So, hypotenuse AB would be sqrt(AC² + BC²) = sqrt(6² + 8²) = sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10. Okay, so AB is 10 units long.Now, points D and E are on AB and BC respectively, and angle BED is 90 degrees. Also, DE is given as 4 units. I need to find the length of BD. Hmm, okay.Let me try to sketch this in my mind. Point D is somewhere on AB, and point E is somewhere on BC. When I connect D and E, the segment DE is 4 units, and angle at E (BED) is a right angle. So, triangle BED is a right-angled triangle with right angle at E.I think I can use coordinate geometry here. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let's place point C at (0,0), so point A would be at (0,6) because AC is 6 units. Wait, no, hold on. If AC is 6 and BC is 8, and angle C is 90 degrees, then actually, if I place point C at (0,0), then point A would be at (0,6) and point B would be at (8,0). Wait, no, that might not be correct because the lengths of AC and BC are 6 and 8, respectively.Wait, actually, in a right-angled triangle, the sides adjacent to the right angle are the legs. So, AC and BC are the legs. So, if point C is at (0,0), then point A can be at (0,6) and point B at (8,0). Then, AB would be the hypotenuse connecting (0,6) to (8,0). Let me confirm the length of AB: distance between (0,6) and (8,0) is sqrt((8-0)² + (0-6)²) = sqrt(64 + 36) = sqrt(100) = 10. Okay, that matches.So, coordinates:- C: (0,0)- A: (0,6)- B: (8,0)- AB: from (0,6) to (8,0)Now, points D and E are on AB and BC respectively. So, point D is somewhere along AB, and point E is somewhere along BC.Let me parameterize point D on AB. Since AB goes from (0,6) to (8,0), I can express D as a point along this line. Let me use a parameter t, where t is the fraction from A to B. So, when t=0, D is at A, and when t=1, D is at B.So, coordinates of D can be written as:D = (8t, 6 - 6t) because moving from (0,6) to (8,0), the x-coordinate increases by 8t and the y-coordinate decreases by 6t.Similarly, point E is on BC. BC goes from (8,0) to (0,0). Wait, no, BC is from (8,0) to (0,0)? Wait, no, point C is at (0,0), point B is at (8,0), so BC is the horizontal line from (8,0) to (0,0). So, point E is somewhere on BC, which is the x-axis from (0,0) to (8,0). So, point E can be represented as (s, 0), where s is between 0 and 8.Wait, but in the Asymptote code provided, it shows point E at (6, 8/3). Hmm, that might be a specific case, but in the problem, E is on BC, which in my coordinate system is the x-axis. So, if E is on BC, its y-coordinate should be 0. But in the Asymptote code, E is at (6,8/3), which is not on BC. Wait, maybe I assigned the coordinates incorrectly.Wait, hold on. Let me check the Asymptote code again. It says:draw(origin--(6,0)--(6,8)--cycle);So, point A is at origin (0,0), point C is at (6,0), and point B is at (6,8). So, triangle ABC is with right angle at C, AC is from (0,0) to (6,0), which is 6 units, and BC is from (6,0) to (6,8), which is 8 units. So, AB is from (0,0) to (6,8). So, AB is the hypotenuse.So, in this coordinate system:- A: (0,0)- C: (6,0)- B: (6,8)- AB: from (0,0) to (6,8)So, that's a different coordinate system than I initially thought. So, I need to adjust my coordinates accordingly.So, in this case, AC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (6,0), and BC is vertical from (6,0) to (6,8). So, AB is the hypotenuse from (0,0) to (6,8). So, the length of AB is sqrt((6)^2 + (8)^2) = sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10, which is consistent.So, points D and E are on AB and BC respectively. So, point D is on AB, which is from (0,0) to (6,8). Let me parameterize point D on AB. Let me use parameter t again, where t=0 is at A (0,0) and t=1 is at B (6,8). So, coordinates of D would be (6t, 8t).Similarly, point E is on BC, which is from (6,0) to (6,8). So, point E can be parameterized as (6, 8s), where s is between 0 and 1. When s=0, E is at C (6,0), and when s=1, E is at B (6,8).Now, angle BED is 90 degrees, and DE is 4 units. So, triangle BED is right-angled at E, with DE=4.Let me write down the coordinates:- Point B: (6,8)- Point E: (6,8s)- Point D: (6t,8t)So, vector BE is from B to E: (6 - 6, 8s - 8) = (0, 8s - 8)Vector DE is from D to E: (6 - 6t, 8s - 8t)Since angle BED is 90 degrees, vectors BE and DE should be perpendicular. So, their dot product should be zero.So, BE · DE = 0Compute BE · DE:BE is (0, 8s - 8)DE is (6 - 6t, 8s - 8t)Dot product = 0*(6 - 6t) + (8s - 8)*(8s - 8t) = 0 + (8s - 8)(8s - 8t) = 0So, (8s - 8)(8s - 8t) = 0Factor out 8:8(s - 1) * 8(s - t) = 0So, 64(s - 1)(s - t) = 0So, either s = 1 or s = tBut s = 1 would mean E is at B (6,8). But if E is at B, then DE would be the same as DB, but angle BED would be undefined because E and B would coincide. So, s can't be 1. Therefore, s = t.So, s = t.Therefore, point E is (6, 8s) and point D is (6s, 8s). So, both points D and E have the same parameter s.Now, DE is given as 4 units. So, the distance between D (6s, 8s) and E (6, 8s) is 4.Compute DE:Distance DE = sqrt[(6 - 6s)^2 + (8s - 8s)^2] = sqrt[(6 - 6s)^2 + 0] = |6 - 6s|Given that DE = 4, so |6 - 6s| = 4So, 6 - 6s = ±4Case 1: 6 - 6s = 4Then, 6s = 6 - 4 = 2So, s = 2/6 = 1/3Case 2: 6 - 6s = -4Then, 6s = 6 + 4 = 10So, s = 10/6 = 5/3But s is a parameter between 0 and 1 because point E is on BC from (6,0) to (6,8). So, s cannot be 5/3 because that would place E beyond point B. Therefore, s = 1/3.So, s = 1/3Therefore, point D is (6s, 8s) = (6*(1/3), 8*(1/3)) = (2, 8/3)Point E is (6, 8s) = (6, 8*(1/3)) = (6, 8/3)So, BD is the distance from B (6,8) to D (2,8/3)Compute BD:Distance BD = sqrt[(6 - 2)^2 + (8 - 8/3)^2] = sqrt[(4)^2 + (16/3)^2] = sqrt[16 + 256/9] = sqrt[(144/9) + (256/9)] = sqrt[400/9] = 20/3So, BD is 20/3 units.Wait, let me double-check my calculations.First, coordinates:- Point D: (2, 8/3)- Point B: (6,8)Difference in x: 6 - 2 = 4Difference in y: 8 - 8/3 = 24/3 - 8/3 = 16/3So, BD = sqrt(4² + (16/3)²) = sqrt(16 + 256/9) = sqrt((144 + 256)/9) = sqrt(400/9) = 20/3. Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, since DE is 4, and DE is horizontal from (2,8/3) to (6,8/3), so the distance is 6 - 2 = 4, which matches DE=4.Also, angle at E is 90 degrees, so vectors BE and DE are perpendicular. Let me verify that.Vector BE is from B (6,8) to E (6,8/3): (0, -16/3)Vector DE is from D (2,8/3) to E (6,8/3): (4, 0)Dot product of BE and DE: (0)(4) + (-16/3)(0) = 0. So, they are perpendicular. That checks out.Therefore, the length of BD is 20/3.**Final Answer**The length of ( BD ) is (boxed{dfrac{20}{3}})."},{"question":"Let [f(x) =begin{cases}2x + 9 &text{if }x<-2, 5-2x&text{if }xge -2.end{cases}]Find f(3).","answer":"To find ( f(3) ), I need to determine which part of the piecewise function applies when ( x = 3 ).First, I check the condition for the first case: ( x < -2 ).

Since ( 3 ) is greater than or equal to ( -2 ), I use the expression ( 5 - 2x ).Substituting ( x = 3 ) into ( 5 - 2x ) gives ( 5 - 2(3) = 5 - 6 = -1 ).Therefore, ( f(3) = -1 )."},{"question":"An infinite geometric sequence {a_{n}} has a first term of a_{1} and a common ratio of q. If sum_{i=1}^{+infty}{{a_i}=frac{1}{2}}, then 2a_{1}+q=______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about an infinite geometric sequence. Let me try to parse it step by step. First, the problem says: An infinite geometric sequence {a_n} has a first term of a1 and a common ratio of q. The sum from i=1 to infinity of a_i is 1/2. Then, we need to find the value of 2a1 + q. Okay, so let's recall what I know about geometric sequences. A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, which is q in this case. So, the first term is a1, the second term is a1*q, the third term is a1*q^2, and so on. Now, the problem mentions an infinite geometric series. I remember that the sum of an infinite geometric series can be found using the formula S = a1 / (1 - q), provided that the absolute value of q is less than 1. That makes sense because if |q| is less than 1, the terms get smaller and smaller, approaching zero, so the series converges. If |q| is equal to or greater than 1, the series doesn't converge. Given that the sum is 1/2, we can set up the equation: a1 / (1 - q) = 1/2So, that's our starting point. We need to find 2a1 + q. Hmm, so we have one equation with two variables, a1 and q. But since we're asked to find an expression in terms of a1 and q, maybe we can express a1 in terms of q or vice versa and substitute it into 2a1 + q.Let me write down the equation again:a1 / (1 - q) = 1/2I can solve this for a1:Multiply both sides by (1 - q):a1 = (1/2)(1 - q)So, a1 is equal to (1 - q)/2. Now, let's compute 2a1 + q. If a1 is (1 - q)/2, then 2a1 is 2*(1 - q)/2, which simplifies to (1 - q). So, 2a1 is (1 - q). Therefore, 2a1 + q is (1 - q) + q. Wait, that simplifies to 1 - q + q, which is 1. Is that right? Let me check my steps again.1. The sum of the infinite geometric series is given by S = a1 / (1 - q) = 1/2.2. Solving for a1: a1 = (1/2)(1 - q).3. Then, 2a1 is 2*(1/2)(1 - q) = (1 - q).4. So, 2a1 + q = (1 - q) + q = 1.Yes, that seems correct. So, regardless of the values of a1 and q, as long as the sum converges to 1/2, 2a1 + q will always be 1. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem or if I might have missed something. Alternatively, maybe I can express q in terms of a1 and then substitute back into 2a1 + q. Let's try that.From the sum formula:a1 / (1 - q) = 1/2So, 1 - q = 2a1Therefore, q = 1 - 2a1Then, 2a1 + q = 2a1 + (1 - 2a1) = 2a1 + 1 - 2a1 = 1Same result. So, whether I express a1 in terms of q or q in terms of a1, I end up with 2a1 + q = 1.Hmm, so that seems consistent. Just to make sure, let me plug in some numbers. Suppose a1 is 1/2, then the sum would be (1/2) / (1 - q) = 1/2. So, 1/(1 - q) = 1, which implies that q = 0. Then, 2a1 + q = 2*(1/2) + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1. That works.Another example: Let's say a1 is 1/3. Then, the sum is (1/3)/(1 - q) = 1/2. So, (1/3) = (1 - q)/2, which gives 1 - q = 2/3, so q = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. Then, 2a1 + q = 2*(1/3) + 1/3 = 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Again, it works.Wait, let me try with a different a1. Let's say a1 is 1/4. Then, the sum is (1/4)/(1 - q) = 1/2. So, 1/(1 - q) = 2*(1/4) = 1/2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it properly.Wait, (1/4)/(1 - q) = 1/2. So, multiply both sides by (1 - q):1/4 = (1/2)(1 - q)Multiply both sides by 2:1/2 = 1 - qSo, q = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2Then, 2a1 + q = 2*(1/4) + 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Yep, still 1.So, no matter what a1 is, as long as the sum is 1/2, 2a1 + q is always 1. That makes sense because when we solved the equation, the variables canceled out, leading to a constant.Therefore, I think the answer is 1.**Final Answer**The value of (2a_{1} + q) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"A positive integer is called sparkly if it has exactly 9 digits, and for any n between 1 and 9 (inclusive), the nth digit is a positive multiple of n. How many positive integers are sparkly?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive integers are \\"sparkly.\\" From the problem statement, a sparkly number is a 9-digit positive integer where each digit satisfies a specific condition. Specifically, for any n between 1 and 9 (inclusive), the nth digit must be a positive multiple of n. Let me break this down. Each digit in the 9-digit number has its own rule based on its position. So, the first digit must be a multiple of 1, the second digit a multiple of 2, and so on up to the ninth digit, which must be a multiple of 9. First, let me note that since it's a 9-digit number, the first digit cannot be zero. That makes sense because otherwise, it wouldn't be a 9-digit number—it would effectively be an 8-digit number. So, each digit must be between 1 and 9, inclusive, except for the positions where the multiple allows for higher digits, but actually, since each digit is a single digit, the maximum value for any digit is 9. So, each digit must be between 1 and 9, but also satisfy the multiple condition.Wait, hold on. Actually, for each digit position n, the nth digit must be a positive multiple of n. But since each digit is a single digit (i.e., from 0 to 9), the possible values for each digit are limited. However, the first digit can't be zero, so for n=1, the first digit must be a multiple of 1, which is any digit from 1 to 9. For n=2, the second digit must be a multiple of 2, so it can be 2, 4, 6, or 8. Similarly, for n=3, the third digit must be a multiple of 3, so possible digits are 3, 6, or 9. I think I can approach this problem by considering each digit position separately and determining how many choices we have for each digit. Then, since each digit is independent of the others (as long as they satisfy their own conditions), the total number of sparkly numbers would be the product of the number of choices for each digit.Let me write down each position and the possible digits:1. Position 1: Must be a multiple of 1. Since it's a single digit, the possible digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, 9 choices.2. Position 2: Must be a multiple of 2. The single-digit multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8. So, 4 choices.3. Position 3: Must be a multiple of 3. The single-digit multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9. So, 3 choices.4. Position 4: Must be a multiple of 4. The single-digit multiples of 4 are 4, 8. So, 2 choices.5. Position 5: Must be a multiple of 5. The single-digit multiples of 5 are 5. So, only 1 choice.6. Position 6: Must be a multiple of 6. The single-digit multiples of 6 are 6. So, only 1 choice.7. Position 7: Must be a multiple of 7. The single-digit multiples of 7 are 7. So, only 1 choice.8. Position 8: Must be a multiple of 8. The single-digit multiples of 8 are 8. So, only 1 choice.9. Position 9: Must be a multiple of 9. The single-digit multiples of 9 are 9. So, only 1 choice.Wait, hold on. Let me verify each position:- Position 1: Multiples of 1 are all digits from 1-9, correct.- Position 2: Multiples of 2: 2,4,6,8. Correct, 4 choices.- Position 3: Multiples of 3: 3,6,9. Correct, 3 choices.- Position 4: Multiples of 4: 4,8. Correct, 2 choices.- Position 5: Multiples of 5: 5 is the only single-digit multiple. Correct, 1 choice.- Position 6: Multiples of 6: 6 is the only single-digit multiple. Correct, 1 choice.- Position 7: Multiples of 7: 7 is the only single-digit multiple. Correct, 1 choice.- Position 8: Multiples of 8: 8 is the only single-digit multiple. Correct, 1 choice.- Position 9: Multiples of 9: 9 is the only single-digit multiple. Correct, 1 choice.So, each position has a certain number of choices, and since each digit is independent, the total number of sparkly numbers is the product of these choices.So, let me compute that:Total sparkly numbers = 9 (for position 1) × 4 (position 2) × 3 (position 3) × 2 (position 4) × 1 (position 5) × 1 (position 6) × 1 (position 7) × 1 (position 8) × 1 (position 9).Calculating this:First, multiply 9 × 4 = 36.Then, 36 × 3 = 108.Next, 108 × 2 = 216.Then, 216 × 1 = 216.Continuing, 216 × 1 = 216.216 × 1 = 216.216 × 1 = 216.216 × 1 = 216.So, the total number is 216.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if I missed anything.Is there any position where the number of choices is different? Let's go through each position again.1. Position 1: 9 choices. Correct.2. Position 2: 4 choices. Correct.3. Position 3: 3 choices. Correct.4. Position 4: 2 choices. Correct.5. Position 5: 1 choice. Correct.6. Position 6: 1 choice. Correct.7. Position 7: 1 choice. Correct.8. Position 8: 1 choice. Correct.9. Position 9: 1 choice. Correct.So, 9 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 = 216.Hmm, so the total number of sparkly numbers is 216.But just to make sure, let me think about whether each digit is indeed independent. For example, does the choice of digit in position 1 affect the choices in other positions? Since each digit is determined solely by its position, the choices are independent. So, multiplication principle applies here.Another way to think about it: Each digit is selected based on its position's requirement, so the total number is the product of the number of options for each digit.Therefore, 9 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 = 216.I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I think the answer is 216.**Final Answer**The number of sparkly positive integers is boxed{216}."},{"question":"A line parallel to the bases of a trapezoid passes through the intersection point of its diagonals. Find the length of the segment of this line that is enclosed between the non-parallel sides of the trapezoid, given that the lengths of the bases of the trapezoid are 4 cm and 12 cm.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a trapezoid. The bases are 4 cm and 12 cm long. There's a line that's parallel to these bases, and it passes through the intersection point of the diagonals. I need to find the length of the segment of this line that's between the non-parallel sides. Hmm, okay.First, let me visualize the trapezoid. It has two parallel sides, the bases, which are 4 cm and 12 cm. The other two sides are non-parallel, so they must be the legs of the trapezoid. The diagonals of the trapezoid intersect each other at some point inside the trapezoid. The line we're interested in is parallel to the bases and goes through this intersection point. I need to find the length of the segment of this line that lies between the legs.I remember that in a trapezoid, the diagonals intersect each other in the same ratio. That is, the ratio of the lengths of the segments of one diagonal is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the segments of the other diagonal. This ratio is the same as the ratio of the lengths of the two bases.So, if the bases are 4 cm and 12 cm, the ratio is 4:12, which simplifies to 1:3. That means the diagonals intersect each other such that the part of each diagonal from the vertex to the intersection point is 1 part, and from the intersection point to the other base is 3 parts.Now, the line that's parallel to the bases and passes through the intersection point of the diagonals. This line will create a smaller trapezoid within the original trapezoid. The segment of this line between the legs is the length we need to find.I think this smaller trapezoid is similar to the original trapezoid because all the sides are parallel. So, similarity might help here. If the ratio of the bases is 1:3, then the ratio of similarity might be related to this.Wait, actually, the line passes through the intersection point of the diagonals, which divides each diagonal into a ratio of 1:3. So, the distance from the intersection point to each base is in the ratio 1:3. Therefore, the length of the segment of the line we're looking for should be somewhere between 4 cm and 12 cm.I remember there's a formula for a line segment parallel to the bases in a trapezoid, which is given by the harmonic mean of the two bases. But wait, is that correct? Or is it the weighted average based on the ratio?Let me think. If the line is closer to the shorter base, its length would be closer to 4 cm, and if it's closer to the longer base, it would be closer to 12 cm. Since the intersection point divides the diagonals in the ratio 1:3, the line is closer to the shorter base. So, the length should be somewhere between 4 cm and 12 cm, but closer to 4 cm.Wait, actually, the ratio is 1:3, so the distance from the shorter base is 1 part, and the distance from the longer base is 3 parts. So, the total distance between the bases is 4 parts. Therefore, the line is 1 part away from the shorter base and 3 parts away from the longer base.But how does this relate to the length of the segment? Maybe we can use similar triangles here. The trapezoid can be thought of as two triangles when you draw the diagonals. The intersection point divides each diagonal into a 1:3 ratio.Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept that the length of a line segment parallel to the bases in a trapezoid is given by the weighted average based on the ratio of the distances from the bases.So, if the ratio of the distances is 1:3, then the length of the segment would be (3*4 + 1*12)/(1+3). Let me compute that: (12 + 12)/4 = 24/4 = 6 cm. Hmm, so 6 cm? Wait, that seems too straightforward.But wait, actually, the formula for the length of a line segment parallel to the bases in a trapezoid is given by:length = ( (distance from shorter base / total height) * longer base ) + ( (distance from longer base / total height) * shorter base )But in this case, the distances are in the ratio 1:3, so the length would be (3/4)*4 + (1/4)*12 = 3 + 3 = 6 cm. So, that seems to confirm it.But let me think again. If the diagonals intersect in the ratio 1:3, then the line through the intersection point parallel to the bases is actually the harmonic mean of the two bases. Wait, harmonic mean of 4 and 12 is 2*(4*12)/(4+12) = 96/16 = 6 cm. So, that also gives 6 cm.Wait, so both methods give 6 cm. So, maybe 6 cm is the correct answer.But let me verify this with another approach. Let's consider the coordinates. Let me place the trapezoid on a coordinate system. Let’s say the shorter base is on the x-axis from (0,0) to (4,0). The longer base is parallel to the x-axis, so let's say it's from (a,h) to (a+12,h), where h is the height of the trapezoid.Now, the diagonals are from (0,0) to (a+12,h) and from (4,0) to (a,h). The intersection point of these diagonals can be found by solving the equations of the lines.The equation of the first diagonal is y = (h/(a+12))x.The equation of the second diagonal is y = (h/(a-4))(x - 4).Setting them equal:(h/(a+12))x = (h/(a-4))(x - 4)Divide both sides by h:x/(a+12) = (x - 4)/(a - 4)Cross-multiplying:x(a - 4) = (x - 4)(a + 12)Expanding both sides:a x - 4x = a x + 12x - 4a - 48Simplify:a x - 4x = a x + 12x - 4a - 48Subtract a x from both sides:-4x = 12x - 4a - 48Bring all terms to left:-4x -12x +4a +48 =0-16x +4a +48=0Divide both sides by 4:-4x +a +12=0So, a =4x -12Hmm, okay. So, from this, we can express a in terms of x.But I also know that the intersection point divides the diagonals in the ratio 1:3. So, the coordinates of the intersection point can be found using the section formula.For the first diagonal from (0,0) to (a+12,h), the intersection point divides it in the ratio 1:3. So, the coordinates would be:x = (3*0 +1*(a+12))/(1+3) = (a+12)/4y = (3*0 +1*h)/4 = h/4Similarly, for the second diagonal from (4,0) to (a,h), the intersection point divides it in the ratio 1:3 as well. So, the coordinates would be:x = (3*4 +1*a)/(1+3) = (12 +a)/4y = (3*0 +1*h)/4 = h/4So, both give the same y-coordinate, which is h/4, and the x-coordinate is (a+12)/4 from the first diagonal and (12 +a)/4 from the second diagonal. So, they are consistent.Therefore, the intersection point is at ((a+12)/4, h/4).Now, the line parallel to the bases passing through this point will have the same slope as the bases, which is zero since they are horizontal. So, the equation of this line is y = h/4.We need to find the points where this line intersects the non-parallel sides of the trapezoid. The non-parallel sides are the legs, which connect the bases.Let me find the equations of the legs.First leg connects (0,0) to (a,h). The slope is (h -0)/(a -0) = h/a. So, equation is y = (h/a)x.Second leg connects (4,0) to (a+12,h). The slope is (h -0)/(a+12 -4) = h/(a+8). So, equation is y = (h/(a+8))(x -4).Now, find the intersection points of y = h/4 with these two legs.First intersection with the first leg:h/4 = (h/a)xDivide both sides by h:1/4 = (1/a)xSo, x = a/4So, the point is (a/4, h/4)Second intersection with the second leg:h/4 = (h/(a+8))(x -4)Divide both sides by h:1/4 = (1/(a+8))(x -4)Multiply both sides by (a+8):(a+8)/4 = x -4So, x = (a+8)/4 +4 = (a+8 +16)/4 = (a +24)/4So, the point is ((a +24)/4, h/4)Therefore, the segment of the line y = h/4 between the legs is from (a/4, h/4) to ((a +24)/4, h/4). The length of this segment is the difference in x-coordinates, since y is constant.So, length = ( (a +24)/4 - a/4 ) = (a +24 -a)/4 = 24/4 = 6 cm.Wow, so regardless of the value of a, the length is 6 cm. That's interesting. So, no matter how the trapezoid is shaped, as long as the bases are 4 cm and 12 cm, the length of the segment through the intersection of the diagonals is 6 cm.Therefore, the answer should be 6 cm.But just to make sure, let me think of another way. Maybe using similar triangles.Since the line is parallel to the bases, the two triangles formed above and below this line are similar to the original trapezoid.The ratio of similarity is the same as the ratio of the distances from the intersection point to the bases. Since the diagonals intersect in the ratio 1:3, the distance from the intersection point to the shorter base is 1 part, and to the longer base is 3 parts. So, the ratio is 1:3.Therefore, the length of the segment should be the weighted average based on these ratios.Wait, actually, the formula for the length of a line segment parallel to the bases in a trapezoid is given by:length = ( (distance from shorter base / total height) * longer base ) + ( (distance from longer base / total height) * shorter base )But in this case, the distances are in the ratio 1:3, so the length would be (3/4)*4 + (1/4)*12 = 3 + 3 = 6 cm.Alternatively, since the ratio of the distances is 1:3, the length can be calculated as:length = ( (3 * shorter base) + (1 * longer base) ) / (1 + 3 ) = (12 +12)/4 = 24/4 =6 cm.So, both methods give the same result.Therefore, I'm confident that the length is 6 cm.**Final Answer**The length of the segment is boxed{6} cm."},{"question":"Happy Island has 60 turtles.

The variance of this data set is given as s² = 3. Now, I need to find the variance of a new data set where each value is multiplied by 2. So the new data set is 2x₁, 2x₂, 2x₃, 2x₄, 2x₅. Hmm, I think I remember something about how multiplying each data point by a constant affects the variance, but I need to recall exactly how that works.Let me start by recalling the definition of variance. Variance measures how spread out the numbers in a data set are. It's calculated as the average of the squared differences from the Mean. So, if I have a data set, I first find the mean, then subtract the mean from each data point, square the result, and then take the average of those squared differences. That gives me the variance.Now, if I multiply each data point by a constant, say 2 in this case, what happens to the mean? Well, if every data point is doubled, the mean will also be doubled. Let me denote the original mean as μ. So, the new mean after multiplying each data point by 2 would be 2μ.Next, I need to think about how this scaling affects the squared differences from the mean. The original variance is s² = 3. Let's denote the original data points as x₁, x₂, ..., x₅. The variance formula is:s² = (1/(n-1)) * Σ(xᵢ - μ)²where n is the number of data points. In this case, n = 5.So, when we multiply each xᵢ by 2, the new data points become 2x₁, 2x₂, ..., 2x₅. The new mean becomes 2μ. Let's compute the squared differences for the new data set.For each new data point 2xᵢ, the squared difference from the new mean is (2xᵢ - 2μ)². Let's factor out the 2:(2xᵢ - 2μ)² = [2(xᵢ - μ)]² = 4(xᵢ - μ)²So, each squared difference is multiplied by 4. Therefore, the sum of the squared differences for the new data set is 4 times the sum of the squared differences for the original data set.Let me write that out:Σ(2xᵢ - 2μ)² = Σ[4(xᵢ - μ)²] = 4Σ(xᵢ - μ)²Since variance is the average of these squared differences, the new variance would be:s_new² = (1/(n-1)) * Σ(2xᵢ - 2μ)² = (1/(n-1)) * 4Σ(xᵢ - μ)² = 4 * [(1/(n-1)) * Σ(xᵢ - μ)²] = 4 * s²So, the new variance is 4 times the original variance. Given that the original variance s² is 3, the new variance should be 4 * 3 = 12.Wait, let me double-check that. If I have each term multiplied by 2, the squared terms get multiplied by 4, so the variance, which is the average of those squared terms, should also get multiplied by 4. Yeah, that makes sense.Alternatively, I remember there's a formula that says if you multiply each data point by a constant k, the variance becomes k² times the original variance. So, in this case, k is 2, so the new variance is 2² * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12.Just to make sure I haven't made a mistake, let me think through an example. Suppose I have a simple data set where all the xᵢ are the same, say x₁ = x₂ = x₃ = x₄ = x₅ = 1. Then the mean is 1, and each squared difference is (1 - 1)² = 0. So the variance is 0. If I multiply each by 2, the new data set is 2, 2, 2, 2, 2. The mean is 2, and each squared difference is still 0. So the variance is still 0. That checks out because 4 * 0 = 0.Another example: suppose the original data set is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The mean is (0+1+2+3+4)/5 = 10/5 = 2. The squared differences are (0-2)²=4, (1-2)²=1, (2-2)²=0, (3-2)²=1, (4-2)²=4. Summing these gives 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 10. Since n=5, the variance is 10/(5-1) = 10/4 = 2.5. Now, if I multiply each data point by 2, the new data set is 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. The new mean is (0+2+4+6+8)/5 = 20/5 = 4. The squared differences are (0-4)²=16, (2-4)²=4, (4-4)²=0, (6-4)²=4, (8-4)²=16. Summing these gives 16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16 = 40. The new variance is 40/(5-1) = 40/4 = 10. Which is 4 times the original variance of 2.5. So that works too.Therefore, I'm confident that multiplying each data point by 2 increases the variance by a factor of 4. So, in the given problem, the original variance is 3, so the new variance is 4 * 3 = 12.**Final Answer**The variance of the new sample data is boxed{12}."},{"question":"Jessy told eleven jokes this past Saturday, and Alan told seven jokes.

What is the probability that out of five players, exactly three miss the penalty kick?","answer":"First, I recognize that this is a binomial probability problem because each penalty kick is an independent trial with two possible outcomes: success or failure.The coach mentioned a 95% success rate, so the probability of success (scoring) is 0.95, and the probability of failure (missing) is 0.05.We need to find the probability that exactly three out of five players miss their penalty kicks. This means two players score and three do not.Using the binomial probability formula:P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)Where:- n = 5 (total number of trials)- k = 3 (number of failures)- p = 0.05 (probability of failure)First, calculate the combination C(5, 3), which is the number of ways to choose 3 failures out of 5 trials. C(5, 3) = 10.Next, calculate the probability of exactly three failures: (0.05)^3 = 0.000125.Then, calculate the probability of the remaining two successes: (0.95)^2 ≈ 0.9025.Finally, multiply these values together: 10 * 0.000125 * 0.9025 ≈ 0.001128125.So, the probability that exactly three out of five players miss their penalty kicks is approximately 0.1128%."},{"question":"The condition ([x] = [y]) is a ( ) condition for the condition (|x-y| < 1):A. Sufficient but not necessary conditionB. Necessary but not sufficient conditionC. Necessary and sufficient conditionD. Neither sufficient nor necessary condition","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: The condition [x] = [y] is a ( ) condition for the condition |x - y| < 1. The options are A, B, C, D, which correspond to whether it's sufficient but not necessary, necessary but not sufficient, both necessary and sufficient, or neither.First, I need to understand what [x] and [y] mean. I think [x] is the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to x. So, for example, [3.7] is 3, and [−1.2] is −2. So, [x] = [y] means that x and y are in the same integer interval. That is, they are in the same [n, n+1) interval for some integer n.Now, the condition |x - y| < 1 means that the distance between x and y is less than 1. So, if two numbers are within 1 unit of each other, they must be in the same integer interval, right? Because if they were in different intervals, the distance would be at least 1. For example, if x is in [n, n+1) and y is in [n+1, n+2), then the smallest distance between x and y is 0 (if they are at the endpoints) but actually, if x is approaching n+1 from below and y is approaching n+1 from above, the distance approaches 0. Wait, no, that's not right. If x is in [n, n+1) and y is in [n+1, n+2), the smallest distance between x and y is 0, but actually, x can be n+1 - ε and y can be n+1 + ε, so the distance is 2ε, which can be made as small as desired. Hmm, so actually, two numbers can be in adjacent intervals and still have |x - y| < 1. For example, x = 1.9 and y = 2.1, then |x - y| = 0.2 < 1, but [x] = 1 and [y] = 2, so [x] ≠ [y].Wait, so that means that [x] = [y] is not necessary for |x - y| < 1, because you can have |x - y| < 1 even if [x] ≠ [y]. So, does that mean that [x] = [y] is a sufficient condition? Because if [x] = [y], then x and y are in the same interval, so |x - y| < 1. But it's not necessary because you can have |x - y| < 1 without [x] = [y].Let me test this with some examples. Let's say x = 1.5 and y = 1.3. Then [x] = 1, [y] = 1, so [x] = [y], and |x - y| = 0.2 < 1. That works. Now, if x = 1.5 and y = 2.3, then [x] = 1, [y] = 2, so [x] ≠ [y], but |x - y| = 0.8 < 1. So, here, |x - y| < 1 is true even though [x] ≠ [y]. So, [x] = [y] is not necessary.On the other hand, if [x] = [y], then x and y are in the same integer interval, so their difference is less than 1. So, [x] = [y] is a sufficient condition for |x - y| < 1.Therefore, [x] = [y] is a sufficient but not necessary condition for |x - y| < 1. So, the answer should be A.Wait, but let me think again. If [x] = [y], then x and y are in the same integer interval, so |x - y| < 1. So, it's sufficient. But as shown earlier, |x - y| < 1 can happen even if [x] ≠ [y], so it's not necessary. So, yeah, A is correct.I think that's it. So, the answer is A."},{"question":"In year N, the 300^{text{th}} day of the year is a Tuesday. In year N+1, the 200^{text{th}} day is also a Tuesday.

Let me try to parse it step by step.First, the problem says: In year N, the 300th day is a Tuesday. In year N+1, the 200th day is also a Tuesday. I need to find out what day of the week the 100th day of year N-1 was. The options are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday.Hmm, okay. So, we have three consecutive years: N-1, N, and N+1. We know something about day 300 in year N and day 200 in year N+1, and we need to figure out day 100 in year N-1.I think the key here is to figure out whether year N is a leap year or not because that affects the number of days between the years, which in turn affects the day of the week.Wait, right. Because if year N is a leap year, then year N has 366 days, otherwise, it has 365. Similarly, year N+1 could be a leap year or not, but since we're going from N to N+1, the number of days in year N will determine how the days shift.So, let me recall that a common year has 365 days, which is 52 weeks plus 1 day. So, each common year shifts the day of the week by 1. A leap year has 366 days, which is 52 weeks plus 2 days, so it shifts the day by 2.Therefore, if I can figure out whether year N is a leap year, I can figure out how the days shift from year N-1 to N, and then from N to N+1.But wait, do I know whether year N is a leap year? The problem doesn't specify, but maybe I can figure it out from the given information.Let me try to see. So, in year N, day 300 is a Tuesday. In year N+1, day 200 is a Tuesday. So, the number of days between day 300 of year N and day 200 of year N+1 will determine the shift in days.Wait, so from day 300 of year N to the end of year N is 365 - 300 = 65 days if it's a common year, or 366 - 300 = 66 days if it's a leap year.Then, from the start of year N+1 to day 200 is 200 days.So, the total number of days between day 300 of year N and day 200 of year N+1 is either 65 + 200 = 265 days or 66 + 200 = 266 days, depending on whether year N is a leap year.Now, since both day 300 of year N and day 200 of year N+1 are Tuesdays, the number of days between them must be a multiple of 7. Because if you have the same day of the week, the number of days in between must be a multiple of 7.So, 265 divided by 7 is 37 weeks and 6 days. 266 divided by 7 is exactly 38 weeks.So, 265 days is 37 weeks and 6 days, which would mean a shift of 6 days. 266 days is exactly 38 weeks, so no shift.But since both days are Tuesday, the shift must be a multiple of 7. So, if year N is a leap year, the total days between are 266, which is exactly 38 weeks, so no shift. Therefore, day 300 of year N is Tuesday, and day 200 of year N+1 is also Tuesday. So, that would make sense if year N is a leap year because the shift is 2 days, but wait, let me think.Wait, hold on. If year N is a leap year, then from day 300 of year N to the end of year N is 66 days, and then from the start of year N+1 to day 200 is 200 days. So, total days between day 300 of N and day 200 of N+1 is 66 + 200 = 266 days. 266 divided by 7 is 38, so exactly 38 weeks. So, same day of the week. So, that works.If year N is a common year, then the total days between would be 65 + 200 = 265 days. 265 divided by 7 is 37 weeks and 6 days. So, that would mean that day 200 of year N+1 is 6 days later in the week than day 300 of year N. But day 300 is Tuesday, so adding 6 days would make it Monday. But in the problem, day 200 of year N+1 is also Tuesday. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, year N must be a leap year.Okay, so year N is a leap year. Therefore, year N has 366 days, so the shift from year N-1 to year N is 2 days. Because a leap year has 366 days, which is 52 weeks and 2 days, so the next year starts 2 days later.Wait, actually, hold on. Let me clarify.If year N is a leap year, then year N-1 could be either a leap year or a common year. Wait, but leap years are every 4 years, so unless N-1 is also a leap year, which would be if N is a leap year, then N-1 would be 3 years after the previous leap year.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.Since year N is a leap year, it has 366 days. So, the day of the week shifts by 2 days from year N-1 to year N. That is, if January 1 of year N-1 is, say, a Monday, then January 1 of year N would be Monday + 2 days = Wednesday, because 366 days later is 52 weeks and 2 days.Wait, actually, no. Wait, the shift is determined by the number of days in the previous year. So, if year N-1 is a common year, then it has 365 days, which is 52 weeks + 1 day, so the next year, year N, would start 1 day later. If year N-1 is a leap year, then it has 366 days, so the next year, year N, would start 2 days later.But we don't know whether year N-1 is a leap year or not. Hmm.Wait, but we do know that year N is a leap year, so year N has 366 days. Therefore, the shift from year N to year N+1 is 2 days. Because 366 days later is 52 weeks and 2 days. So, the day of the week shifts by 2 days.But in the problem, we have that day 300 of year N is Tuesday, and day 200 of year N+1 is Tuesday. So, let's see.Wait, maybe it's better to figure out the day of the week for January 1 of each year.Let me try that approach.Let me denote:Let’s denote D(N) as the day of the week for January 1 of year N.Similarly, D(N-1) is the day for January 1 of year N-1, and D(N+1) is for year N+1.We know that year N is a leap year, so it has 366 days. Therefore, D(N+1) = D(N) + 2 days (mod 7).Similarly, year N-1 could be a common year or a leap year, but since N is a leap year, N-1 is 3 years after the previous leap year, so unless N-1 is also a leap year, which would require N to be 1 mod 4, but we don't know that.Wait, maybe I should not get bogged down here. Let's see.We know that day 300 of year N is Tuesday.So, if I can figure out what day January 1 of year N was, then I can figure out the day of the week for day 100 of year N-1.Wait, but maybe it's better to work backwards.Let me think. Let's figure out the day of the week for January 1 of year N.If day 300 is Tuesday, then day 1 of year N is some day, and day 300 is 299 days later. So, 299 days later is Tuesday.So, if I can find what day 299 days before Tuesday is, that would be January 1.But 299 divided by 7 is 42 weeks and 5 days. So, 299 days is 42 weeks and 5 days. So, 5 days before Tuesday is... Let's count backwards: Tuesday minus 1 day is Monday, minus 2 is Sunday, minus 3 is Saturday, minus 4 is Friday, minus 5 is Thursday. So, January 1 of year N is a Thursday.Wait, let me verify that.If January 1 is Thursday, then day 1 is Thursday, day 2 is Friday, ..., day 7 is Wednesday. Then, day 8 is Thursday, and so on. So, every 7 days, it cycles.So, day 1: ThursdayDay 8: ThursdayDay 15: Thursday...So, day 1 + 7k: ThursdaySimilarly, day 300: Let's see, 300 divided by 7 is 42 weeks and 6 days. So, 42*7=294, so day 294 is Thursday, then day 295 is Friday, 296 Saturday, 297 Sunday, 298 Monday, 299 Tuesday, 300 Wednesday? Wait, that contradicts.Wait, hold on. If January 1 is Thursday, then day 1 is Thursday, day 2 is Friday, day 3 Saturday, day 4 Sunday, day 5 Monday, day 6 Tuesday, day 7 Wednesday.So, day 7 is Wednesday.Then, day 8 is Thursday.So, day 7k + 1 is Thursday.So, day 294 is 7*42=294, so day 294 is Wednesday.Then, day 295 is Thursday, day 296 Friday, day 297 Saturday, day 298 Sunday, day 299 Monday, day 300 Tuesday.Ah, okay, so day 300 is Tuesday, which matches the problem statement. So, January 1 of year N is Thursday.So, D(N) = Thursday.Since year N is a leap year, as we established earlier, the next year, N+1, will start 2 days later. So, D(N+1) = Thursday + 2 days = Saturday.So, January 1 of year N+1 is a Saturday.Now, in year N+1, day 200 is a Tuesday. Let's verify that.If January 1 is Saturday, then day 1 is Saturday, day 2 Sunday, day 3 Monday, day 4 Tuesday, day 5 Wednesday, day 6 Thursday, day 7 Friday.So, day 7 is Friday.Then, day 8 is Saturday, and so on.So, day 200: Let's compute 200 modulo 7.200 divided by 7 is 28 weeks and 4 days. So, 28*7=196, so day 196 is Friday (since day 7 is Friday, day 196 is also Friday). Then, day 197 is Saturday, 198 Sunday, 199 Monday, 200 Tuesday.Yes, that matches the problem statement. So, that checks out.So, now, we know that January 1 of year N is Thursday, and year N is a leap year, so year N-1 must have been a common year because leap years are every 4 years. So, if year N is a leap year, year N-1 is a common year, which has 365 days, so the shift from year N-1 to year N is 1 day.Wait, hold on. Wait, the shift from year N-1 to year N is determined by the number of days in year N-1. If year N-1 is a common year, then it has 365 days, which is 52 weeks + 1 day, so the next year, year N, starts 1 day later. So, if January 1 of year N is Thursday, then January 1 of year N-1 was Thursday minus 1 day, which is Wednesday.Wait, let me think again.If year N-1 is a common year, then it has 365 days. So, 365 days later is 52 weeks and 1 day. So, if January 1 of year N-1 is some day, then January 1 of year N is that day plus 1 day.But we know that January 1 of year N is Thursday. So, January 1 of year N-1 must have been Thursday minus 1 day, which is Wednesday.Wait, but is year N-1 a common year or a leap year?We know that year N is a leap year, so year N-1 is 3 years after the previous leap year. So, unless N-1 is also a leap year, which would require that N is 1 mod 4, but since we don't have that information, we can assume that N-1 is a common year.Therefore, year N-1 is a common year, so it has 365 days, so the shift from N-1 to N is 1 day.Therefore, January 1 of year N-1 was Wednesday.So, D(N-1) = Wednesday.Now, we need to find the day of the week for day 100 of year N-1.So, if January 1 of year N-1 is Wednesday, then day 1 is Wednesday, day 2 is Thursday, day 3 Friday, day 4 Saturday, day 5 Sunday, day 6 Monday, day 7 Tuesday.So, day 7 is Tuesday.Then, day 8 is Wednesday, and so on.So, to find day 100, let's compute 100 modulo 7.100 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 2 days. So, 14*7=98, so day 98 is Tuesday (since day 7 is Tuesday, day 14 is Tuesday, ..., day 98 is Tuesday). Then, day 99 is Wednesday, day 100 is Thursday.Wait, so day 100 is Thursday.But let me verify that.If January 1 is Wednesday, then:Day 1: WednesdayDay 2: ThursdayDay 3: FridayDay 4: SaturdayDay 5: SundayDay 6: MondayDay 7: TuesdayDay 8: Wednesday...So, every 7 days, it cycles.So, day 1: WedDay 8: WedDay 15: Wed...Day 98: Let's see, 98 divided by 7 is 14, so day 98 is Tuesday.Wait, hold on, that contradicts.Wait, day 7 is Tuesday, day 14 is Tuesday, day 21 is Tuesday, ..., day 98 is Tuesday.Wait, so day 98 is Tuesday, then day 99 is Wednesday, day 100 is Thursday.Yes, that's correct.So, day 100 is Thursday.But let me think again. If January 1 is Wednesday, then day 1 is Wednesday, day 2 Thursday, day 3 Friday, day 4 Saturday, day 5 Sunday, day 6 Monday, day 7 Tuesday.So, day 7 is Tuesday.Then, day 8 is Wednesday, day 15 is Wednesday, ..., day 98 is Tuesday (since 98 = 14*7, so day 98 is Tuesday). Then, day 99 is Wednesday, day 100 is Thursday.Yes, that seems consistent.Therefore, the 100th day of year N-1 is a Thursday.Looking back at the options, Thursday is option A.Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the shift from N-1 to N.We said that since year N is a leap year, year N-1 must be a common year, so the shift from N-1 to N is 1 day. So, if January 1 of N is Thursday, then January 1 of N-1 is Wednesday.But wait, let me think about the direction. If year N-1 is a common year, then it has 365 days, which is 52 weeks + 1 day. So, the next year, year N, starts 1 day later. So, if January 1 of N-1 is Wednesday, then January 1 of N is Wednesday + 1 day = Thursday. That's correct.So, that part checks out.Therefore, day 100 of year N-1 is Thursday.So, the answer should be Thursday, which is option A.But wait, let me double-check everything because sometimes these modular arithmetic problems can be tricky.So, recap:- Year N: day 300 is Tuesday.- Year N is a leap year because the shift from day 300 of N to day 200 of N+1 is 266 days, which is exactly 38 weeks, so no shift, meaning year N is a leap year.- Therefore, January 1 of N is Thursday (since day 300 is Tuesday, and 299 days before that is Thursday).- Year N is a leap year, so year N+1 starts 2 days later, so January 1 of N+1 is Saturday.- In year N+1, day 200 is Tuesday, which checks out because 200 days from Saturday is Tuesday.- Year N-1 is a common year because N is a leap year, so N-1 is 3 years after the previous leap year.- Therefore, year N-1 has 365 days, so the shift from N-1 to N is 1 day.- Therefore, January 1 of N-1 is Wednesday (Thursday minus 1 day).- Day 100 of N-1: 100 days from Wednesday.- 100 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 2 days, so day 100 is Wednesday + 2 days = Friday? Wait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.Wait, wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is Wednesday, then day 1 is Wednesday, day 2 is Thursday, day 3 is Friday, day 4 Saturday, day 5 Sunday, day 6 Monday, day 7 Tuesday.So, day 7 is Tuesday.Then, day 8 is Wednesday, day 15 is Wednesday, ..., day 98 is Tuesday.Then, day 99 is Wednesday, day 100 is Thursday.Wait, but if I compute 100 modulo 7, 100 /7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So, day 100 is 2 days after day 98, which is Tuesday. So, Tuesday + 2 days is Thursday.Yes, that's correct.But earlier, I thought, \\"100 days from Wednesday is Wednesday + 2 days = Friday,\\" but that's incorrect because the days cycle every 7 days, so it's not a linear addition but a modular addition.So, day 1 is Wednesday, day 8 is Wednesday, ..., day 99 is Wednesday, day 100 is Thursday.Yes, so that's correct.Therefore, the 100th day of year N-1 is Thursday, which is option A.Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the shift from N-1 to N.If year N-1 is a common year, then it has 365 days, which is 52 weeks + 1 day. So, the next year, year N, starts 1 day later.So, if January 1 of N-1 is Wednesday, then January 1 of N is Thursday, which is correct.Therefore, everything checks out.So, the answer is Thursday, which is option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"The function f(x) is an odd function with a period of 2. When x in [0,1), f(x)=log_2(x+1). Find the value of fleft(frac{2015}{4}right) + log_2 5.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of ( fleft(frac{2015}{4}right) + log_2 5 ). The function ( f(x) ) is given as an odd function with a period of 2. When ( x ) is in the interval ([0,1)), ( f(x) = log_2(x + 1) ). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that an odd function satisfies the property ( f(-x) = -f(x) ) for all ( x ) in its domain. Also, the function has a period of 2, which means that ( f(x + 2) = f(x) ) for all ( x ). So, the function repeats every 2 units. That should help me simplify ( fleft(frac{2015}{4}right) ) by finding an equivalent value within the fundamental period.Let me compute ( frac{2015}{4} ) first. Dividing 2015 by 4, I get 503.75. So, ( frac{2015}{4} = 503.75 ). Now, since the function has a period of 2, I can subtract multiples of 2 to bring this value within the interval ([-1,1)), which is the fundamental period for this function because it's defined on ([0,1)) and is odd.Wait, actually, since the period is 2, the function repeats every 2 units, so I can subtract 2 repeatedly until the result is within the interval ([-1,1)). Let me see how many times 2 goes into 503.75.Calculating ( 503.75 div 2 ), that's 251.875. So, 2 goes into 503.75 exactly 251 times with a remainder. Let me compute the remainder: ( 503.75 - 2 times 251 = 503.75 - 502 = 1.75 ). So, ( f(503.75) = f(1.75) ) because of the periodicity.Now, 1.75 is in the interval ([1,2)). But the function is defined on ([0,1)), so I need to express 1.75 in terms of the function's definition. Since the function is odd, I can use the property ( f(x) = -f(-x) ). Let me see, 1.75 is greater than 1, so maybe I can express it as ( 2 - 0.25 ), which is 1.75. Wait, no, 2 - 0.25 is 1.75, but how does that help?Alternatively, since the function has a period of 2, ( f(1.75) = f(1.75 - 2) = f(-0.25) ). That's better because ( -0.25 ) is within the interval ([-1,0)), and since the function is odd, ( f(-0.25) = -f(0.25) ). So, ( f(1.75) = f(-0.25) = -f(0.25) ).Now, ( f(0.25) ) is straightforward because 0.25 is in the interval ([0,1)). So, ( f(0.25) = log_2(0.25 + 1) = log_2(1.25) ). Therefore, ( f(1.75) = -log_2(1.25) ).So, putting it all together, ( fleft(frac{2015}{4}right) = f(503.75) = f(1.75) = -log_2(1.25) ).Now, I need to compute ( fleft(frac{2015}{4}right) + log_2 5 ). That would be ( -log_2(1.25) + log_2 5 ).Let me simplify this expression. First, ( log_2(1.25) ) is the same as ( log_2left(frac{5}{4}right) ) because 1.25 is 5/4. So, ( -log_2left(frac{5}{4}right) + log_2 5 ).Using logarithm properties, ( -log_2left(frac{5}{4}right) = -(log_2 5 - log_2 4) = -log_2 5 + log_2 4 ). Since ( log_2 4 = 2 ), this becomes ( -log_2 5 + 2 ).So, substituting back into the expression, we have ( (-log_2 5 + 2) + log_2 5 ). The ( -log_2 5 ) and ( + log_2 5 ) cancel each other out, leaving just 2.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. ( f(x) ) is odd and periodic with period 2.2. ( fleft(frac{2015}{4}right) = f(503.75) ).3. Since the period is 2, subtract 2 repeatedly: 503.75 - 2*251 = 503.75 - 502 = 1.75.4. So, ( f(503.75) = f(1.75) ).5. 1.75 is in [1,2), so express it as 2 - 0.25, but since it's periodic, ( f(1.75) = f(-0.25) ).6. Since it's odd, ( f(-0.25) = -f(0.25) ).7. ( f(0.25) = log_2(0.25 + 1) = log_2(1.25) ).8. Therefore, ( f(1.75) = -log_2(1.25) ).9. Then, ( fleft(frac{2015}{4}right) + log_2 5 = -log_2(1.25) + log_2 5 ).10. Simplify ( -log_2(5/4) + log_2 5 = -(log_2 5 - 2) + log_2 5 = -log_2 5 + 2 + log_2 5 = 2 ).Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 2.**Final Answer**boxed{2}"},{"question":"The difference in the areas of two similar triangles is 18 square feet, and the ratio of the larger area to the smaller is the square of an integer.

The difference in their areas is 18 square feet, and the ratio of the larger area to the smaller one is the square of an integer. The area of the smaller triangle is an integer, and one of its sides is 3 feet. I need to find the corresponding side of the larger triangle from the given options.First, let me recall that when two triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. So if the ratio of their areas is ( k^2 ), then the ratio of their corresponding sides is ( k ).Let me denote the area of the smaller triangle as ( A ). Then, the area of the larger triangle would be ( A + 18 ) because the difference is 18 square feet. According to the problem, the ratio of the larger area to the smaller one is the square of an integer. So, we can write:[frac{A + 18}{A} = k^2]Where ( k ) is an integer. Let me simplify this equation:[frac{A + 18}{A} = k^2 1 + frac{18}{A} = k^2 frac{18}{A} = k^2 - 1 A = frac{18}{k^2 - 1}]Since ( A ) is an integer, ( frac{18}{k^2 - 1} ) must also be an integer. Therefore, ( k^2 - 1 ) must be a divisor of 18.Let me list the divisors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.So, ( k^2 - 1 ) must be one of these numbers. Let me find possible integer values of ( k ):1. If ( k^2 - 1 = 1 ), then ( k^2 = 2 ), which implies ( k = sqrt{2} ). But ( k ) must be an integer, so this is not possible.2. If ( k^2 - 1 = 2 ), then ( k^2 = 3 ), so ( k = sqrt{3} ). Again, not an integer.3. If ( k^2 - 1 = 3 ), then ( k^2 = 4 ), so ( k = 2 ). This works because 2 is an integer.4. If ( k^2 - 1 = 6 ), then ( k^2 = 7 ), so ( k = sqrt{7} ). Not an integer.5. If ( k^2 - 1 = 9 ), then ( k^2 = 10 ), so ( k = sqrt{10} ). Not an integer.6. If ( k^2 - 1 = 18 ), then ( k^2 = 19 ), so ( k = sqrt{19} ). Not an integer.So the only possible integer value for ( k ) is 2. Therefore, ( k = 2 ).Now, let's find the area of the smaller triangle ( A ):[A = frac{18}{k^2 - 1} = frac{18}{4 - 1} = frac{18}{3} = 6]So, the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square feet. The area of the larger triangle is ( 6 + 18 = 24 ) square feet.Since the ratio of their areas is ( k^2 = 4 ), the ratio of their corresponding sides is ( k = 2 ). Therefore, each side of the larger triangle is twice as long as the corresponding side of the smaller triangle.Given that one side of the smaller triangle is 3 feet, the corresponding side of the larger triangle is ( 3 times 2 = 6 ) feet.Looking at the options, 6 is option D. So, I think the answer is D) 6.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. The ratio of areas is ( k^2 ), which is an integer squared. So, the ratio is 4 when k=2.2. The difference in areas is 18, so 24 - 6 = 18, which is correct.3. The area of the smaller triangle is 6, which is an integer, as required.4. The corresponding side is 3 feet in the smaller triangle, so in the larger triangle, it's 3*2=6 feet.Yes, that seems correct. So, I think D is the right answer.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"The set of vectors mathbf{v} such that[mathbf{v} cdot mathbf{v} = mathbf{v} cdot begin{pmatrix} 10  -40  8 end{pmatrix}]forms a solid in space.  Find the volume of this solid.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the volume of a solid formed by the set of vectors v that satisfy the equation v · v = v · (10, -40, 8). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I know that the dot product of a vector with itself, v · v, is equal to the square of its magnitude, right? So that's just ||v||². On the other side of the equation, v · (10, -40, 8) is the dot product of v with another vector. Let me denote that vector as a, so a = (10, -40, 8). So the equation becomes ||v||² = v · a.Hmm, I remember that in vector algebra, equations like this often represent geometric shapes. Since we're dealing with vectors in three dimensions, it's probably some kind of quadric surface. Let me recall the standard forms of quadric surfaces. The equation ||v||² = v · a looks similar to the equation of a sphere, but it's not exactly the same because on the right side, we have a linear term instead of a constant.Wait, maybe I can rearrange this equation to get it into a more familiar form. Let's write it out in terms of components. Let me let v = (x, y, z). Then, ||v||² = x² + y² + z², and v · a = 10x - 40y + 8z. So the equation becomes:x² + y² + z² = 10x - 40y + 8z.Okay, so I can rearrange this equation by bringing all the terms to one side:x² - 10x + y² + 40y + z² - 8z = 0.Hmm, this looks like the equation of a sphere, but it's not centered at the origin. I remember that to find the center and radius of a sphere given by an equation like this, I need to complete the square for each variable.Let me do that for each variable.Starting with the x-terms: x² - 10x. To complete the square, I take half of the coefficient of x, which is -10, so half of that is -5, and then square it, getting 25. So I can write x² - 10x as (x - 5)² - 25.Next, the y-terms: y² + 40y. Half of 40 is 20, and squaring that gives 400. So y² + 40y can be written as (y + 20)² - 400.Similarly, for the z-terms: z² - 8z. Half of -8 is -4, and squaring that gives 16. So z² - 8z becomes (z - 4)² - 16.Now, substituting these back into the equation:(x - 5)² - 25 + (y + 20)² - 400 + (z - 4)² - 16 = 0.Combine the constants:-25 - 400 - 16 = -441.So the equation becomes:(x - 5)² + (y + 20)² + (z - 4)² - 441 = 0.Adding 441 to both sides:(x - 5)² + (y + 20)² + (z - 4)² = 441.Ah, so this is indeed the equation of a sphere with center at (5, -20, 4) and radius √441, which is 21. So the solid in question is a sphere with radius 21.Now, the problem asks for the volume of this solid. The volume V of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr³. Plugging in r = 21:V = (4/3)π(21)³.Let me compute 21³. 21 * 21 is 441, and 441 * 21 is... let me compute that. 441 * 20 is 8820, and 441 * 1 is 441, so adding them together gives 8820 + 441 = 9261.So V = (4/3)π * 9261.Now, let's compute (4/3) * 9261. First, divide 9261 by 3. 9261 ÷ 3. Let's see, 3 goes into 9 three times, 3 into 2 is 0 with remainder 2, 3 into 26 is 8 with remainder 2, 3 into 21 is 7. So 9261 ÷ 3 is 3087.Then, multiply 3087 by 4. 3000 * 4 = 12,000, and 87 * 4 = 348, so adding them gives 12,000 + 348 = 12,348.So the volume is 12,348π.Wait, let me double-check that. 21³ is 9261, correct. Then, 9261 * (4/3) is indeed 12,348. So, yes, the volume is 12,348π.But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier, let me recap:1. The equation given is v · v = v · a, which translates to x² + y² + z² = 10x - 40y + 8z.2. Rearranged to x² -10x + y² +40y + z² -8z = 0.3.

If there are 60 trucks in each lane, calculate the total number of vehicles in all the lanes?","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of cars in each lane. The problem states that the number of cars in each lane is twice the total number of trucks across all lanes.There are 4 lanes, and each lane has 60 trucks. So, the total number of trucks in all lanes is 4 multiplied by 60, which equals 240 trucks.Since the number of cars in each lane is twice the total number of trucks, each lane has 2 multiplied by 240, which is 480 cars.Now, to find the total number of vehicles in all lanes, I add the number of cars and trucks in each lane and then multiply by the number of lanes.

The winner of each game scores 2 points, the loser scores 0 points, and in the event of a draw, each player scores 1 point. There are 4 people who have tallied the total scores from this tournament, but due to carelessness, their data are all different, being 1979, 1980, 1984, and 1985 respectively. After verification, it was found that one person's tally was correct. How many players participated in this tournament?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this chess tournament problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, the problem says that in a chess tournament, each pair of players competes in exactly one game. The scoring is straightforward: a win gives 2 points, a loss gives 0, and a draw gives each player 1 point. There are four people who tallied the total scores, but their numbers are all different: 1979, 1980, 1984, and 1985. After checking, only one of these tallies is correct. The question is, how many players participated in the tournament?Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out the number of players such that the total points scored in the tournament is one of those four numbers, and the other three are incorrect. Let me recall some chess tournament basics. In a round-robin tournament, where each pair of players plays exactly once, the total number of games played is given by the combination formula C(n, 2), which is n(n - 1)/2, where n is the number of players. Each game contributes a total of 2 points to the overall score, regardless of whether it's a win/loss or a draw. Because if someone wins, they get 2 points, and the loser gets 0, so total is 2. If it's a draw, both get 1, so total is also 2. So, every game contributes exactly 2 points to the total score.Therefore, the total points in the tournament should be 2 * C(n, 2) = 2 * [n(n - 1)/2] = n(n - 1). So, the total score is n(n - 1). Wait, so the total points must be equal to n(n - 1). That's a key insight. So, the total score is n squared minus n. Given that, the four tallies are 1979, 1980, 1984, and 1985. So, one of these must be equal to n(n - 1). The others are incorrect. So, I need to find an integer n such that n(n - 1) is one of these four numbers, and the other three are not equal to n(n - 1) for any integer n.So, let me compute n(n - 1) for some n and see which one of these numbers fits.Alternatively, maybe I can factor these numbers and see if any of them can be expressed as n(n - 1). Let's see.First, let's consider 1979. Is 1979 equal to n(n - 1) for some integer n? Let's see. Let me compute sqrt(1979) to get an approximate idea of where n might be. sqrt(1979) is approximately 44.48. So, n is around 44 or 45.Let me check n=44: 44*43=1892. That's too low. n=45: 45*44=1980. Oh, that's one of the numbers. So, 1980 is equal to 45*44, which is n(n - 1). So, that would imply that the total number of players is 45. Wait, but 1980 is one of the tallies, so if n=45, then the total score should be 1980. But the other numbers are 1979, 1984, and 1985. So, let me check if these other numbers can be expressed as n(n - 1) for some integer n.Starting with 1979: Let's see if 1979 can be expressed as n(n - 1). Since n(n - 1) is always even because either n or n-1 is even, so the product is even. But 1979 is odd, so it's impossible for 1979 to be equal to n(n - 1). So, 1979 is definitely incorrect.Next, 1984. Let's see if 1984 can be expressed as n(n - 1). Let's compute sqrt(1984) ≈ 44.54. So, n is around 44 or 45. Let's check n=45: 45*44=1980. n=46: 46*45=2070. So, 1984 is between 1980 and 2070. Let's see if 1984 is a product of two consecutive integers. Let me check 44*45=1980, 45*46=2070, so 1984 is not a product of two consecutive integers. So, 1984 cannot be expressed as n(n - 1). Therefore, 1984 is incorrect.Similarly, 1985: Let's check if it can be expressed as n(n - 1). Again, n(n - 1) is even, but 1985 is odd. So, it's impossible. So, 1985 is incorrect.Therefore, only 1980 is equal to n(n - 1) where n=45. So, that must be the correct tally, and the number of players is 45.Wait, but just to make sure, let me verify this. If there are 45 players, each pair plays once, so the total number of games is C(45, 2)= (45*44)/2=990 games. Each game contributes 2 points, so total points is 990*2=1980. That's correct. So, 1980 is indeed the correct total score, and the number of players is 45.Therefore, the answer is 45 players.**Final Answer**The number of players is boxed{45}."},{"question":"The number 1232 is divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 8).

To start, I'll calculate the sum of the digits of 1232, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 8. Since 1232 is divisible by 8, I need to find the next number that meets this criterion.I'll begin by checking the number immediately following 1232, which is 1233. The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9. I'll divide 1233 by 9 to see if it results in an integer. 1233 ÷ 9 = 137, which is an integer.

Find the value of left(-2right)otimes 4; For any rational numbers x and y, if xotimes 3=yotimes left(-3right), find the value of 8x-2y+5.","answer":"Okay, so I have this math problem here with a new operation defined as \\"otimes\\". It says that for any rational numbers a and b, the operation is defined as a otimes b = ab^2 + 2ab + a. They even gave an example: 1 otimes 3 = 1 times 3^2 + 2 times 1 times 3 + 1 = 16. Cool, that makes sense. So, I need to find the value of (-2) otimes 4 first. Then, for any rational numbers x and y, if x otimes 3 = y otimes (-3), I need to find the value of 8x - 2y + 5. Hmm, okay, let's take it step by step.Starting with the first part: (-2) otimes 4. Using the definition, I can plug in a = -2 and b = 4 into the formula. So, let me write that out:(-2) otimes 4 = (-2) times 4^2 + 2 times (-2) times 4 + (-2).Alright, let's compute each term one by one. First, 4^2 is 16. So, the first term is -2 times 16. Let me calculate that: -2 times 16 = -32.Next, the second term is 2 times (-2) times 4. Let me compute that: 2 times -2 is -4, and then -4 times 4 is -16. So, the second term is -16.The third term is just -2.Now, adding all three terms together: -32 + (-16) + (-2). Let me add them step by step. First, -32 + (-16) is -48, and then -48 + (-2) is -50. So, (-2) otimes 4 = -50. That seems straightforward.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 4^2 is indeed 16, and -2 times 16 is -32. Then, 2 times -2 is -4, times 4 is -16. And the last term is -2. Adding them all: -32 -16 is -48, minus 2 is -50. Yep, that's correct.Okay, so the first part is done. Got (-2) otimes 4 = -50.Now, moving on to the second part. It says, for any rational numbers x and y, if x otimes 3 = y otimes (-3), find the value of 8x - 2y + 5.Hmm, so I need to express 8x - 2y + 5 in terms of the given operation. Let me write down the equation x otimes 3 = y otimes (-3) using the definition of otimes.So, substituting into the formula:x otimes 3 = x times 3^2 + 2 times x times 3 + x.Similarly, y otimes (-3) = y times (-3)^2 + 2 times y times (-3) + y.Let me compute both sides.Starting with the left side: x otimes 3.Compute each term:First term: x times 3^2 = x times 9 = 9x.Second term: 2 times x times 3 = 6x.Third term: x.So, adding them together: 9x + 6x + x = 16x. So, x otimes 3 = 16x.Now, the right side: y otimes (-3).Compute each term:First term: y times (-3)^2 = y times 9 = 9y.Second term: 2 times y times (-3) = -6y.Third term: y.Adding them together: 9y - 6y + y = (9 - 6 + 1)y = 4y. So, y otimes (-3) = 4y.So, the equation given is 16x = 4y.Simplify this equation: 16x = 4y.Divide both sides by 4: 4x = y.So, y = 4x.Alright, so now we have a relationship between y and x: y is four times x.Now, we need to find the value of 8x - 2y + 5.Since we know that y = 4x, we can substitute this into the expression.So, let's substitute y with 4x:8x - 2(4x) + 5.Compute each term:First term: 8x.Second term: -2 times 4x is -8x.Third term: +5.So, putting it all together: 8x - 8x + 5.Simplify this: 8x - 8x is 0, so we're left with 5.Therefore, 8x - 2y + 5 = 5.Wait, that's interesting. So regardless of the values of x and y, as long as they satisfy the equation x otimes 3 = y otimes (-3), the expression 8x - 2y + 5 will always equal 5.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, I computed x otimes 3:x times 9 + 2x times 3 + x = 9x + 6x + x = 16x. That seems correct.Then, y otimes (-3):y times 9 + 2y times (-3) + y = 9y - 6y + y = 4y. That also seems correct.So, 16x = 4y, which simplifies to y = 4x. Then, substituting into 8x - 2y +5:8x - 2*(4x) +5 = 8x -8x +5 = 0 +5 =5. Yep, that's correct.So, the value is 5.Wait, just to make sure, let me pick some numbers for x and y that satisfy y = 4x and see if x otimes 3 equals y otimes (-3).Let's choose x =1, so y=4.Compute 1 otimes 3:1*9 + 2*1*3 +1 =9 +6 +1=16.Compute 4 otimes (-3):4*9 + 2*4*(-3) +4=36 -24 +4=16.Yes, both are 16. So, the equation holds.Now, compute 8x -2y +5:8*1 -2*4 +5=8 -8 +5=5. Correct.Another example: x=2, y=8.Compute 2 otimes 3:2*9 + 2*2*3 +2=18 +12 +2=32.Compute 8 otimes (-3):8*9 + 2*8*(-3) +8=72 -48 +8=32.So, 32=32, which is correct.Now, compute 8x -2y +5:8*2 -2*8 +5=16 -16 +5=5. Again, 5.So, seems consistent.Therefore, I feel confident that the answer is 5.**Final Answer**The value of left(-2right)otimes 4 is boxed{-50}, and the value of 8x - 2y + 5 is boxed{5}."},{"question":"In a polar coordinate system, the maximum distance from a point on the curve ρ=2cosθ to the point (1,π) is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: In a polar coordinate system, the maximum distance from a point on the curve ρ = 2cosθ to the point (1, π) is ______. Hmm, I need to figure out what that maximum distance is. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that in polar coordinates, a point is represented as (ρ, θ), where ρ is the distance from the origin and θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. The given curve is ρ = 2cosθ. I think this is a standard polar equation, maybe a circle? Let me recall, yes, ρ = 2acosθ is a circle with radius a, centered at (a, 0) in Cartesian coordinates. So in this case, a is 1, so it's a circle with radius 1 centered at (1, 0). That makes sense.Now, the point we're interested in is (1, π). Let me convert that to Cartesian coordinates to get a better understanding. In polar coordinates, x = ρcosθ and y = ρsinθ. So for the point (1, π), x = 1*cosπ = -1, and y = 1*sinπ = 0. So that point is (-1, 0) in Cartesian coordinates.So, we have a circle centered at (1, 0) with radius 1, and we need to find the maximum distance from any point on this circle to the point (-1, 0). Hmm, okay. So, in Cartesian terms, the circle is centered at (1, 0) with radius 1, and the point is (-1, 0). So, the distance between the centers of the circle and the point is the distance between (1, 0) and (-1, 0), which is 2 units.Since the circle has a radius of 1, the maximum distance from any point on the circle to the point (-1, 0) would be the distance between the centers plus the radius. So, 2 + 1 = 3. Is that right? Let me visualize it. The circle is on the right side of the origin, touching the origin, and the point is on the left side, also touching the origin. The farthest point on the circle from (-1, 0) would be the point on the circle that's diametrically opposite to the origin, which is (2, 0). The distance from (-1, 0) to (2, 0) is indeed 3. So, that seems correct.But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Maybe I should approach this more mathematically instead of just relying on the geometric intuition.So, let's parameterize the points on the curve ρ = 2cosθ. Any point on this curve can be written in Cartesian coordinates as (ρcosθ, ρsinθ) = (2cosθ * cosθ, 2cosθ * sinθ) = (2cos²θ, 2cosθ sinθ). Simplifying that, 2cos²θ is equal to 2*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + cos2θ, and 2cosθ sinθ is sin2θ. So, the Cartesian coordinates are (1 + cos2θ, sin2θ).Now, the point (1, π) in Cartesian is (-1, 0) as I found earlier. So, the distance between a point (x, y) on the curve and (-1, 0) is sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2]. Let's plug in the expressions for x and y:sqrt[(1 + cos2θ + 1)^2 + (sin2θ)^2] = sqrt[(2 + cos2θ)^2 + (sin2θ)^2].Let me expand that expression inside the square root:(2 + cos2θ)^2 + (sin2θ)^2 = 4 + 4cos2θ + cos²2θ + sin²2θ.I know that cos²a + sin²a = 1, so cos²2θ + sin²2θ = 1. Therefore, the expression simplifies to 4 + 4cos2θ + 1 = 5 + 4cos2θ.So, the distance squared is 5 + 4cos2θ. Therefore, the distance is sqrt(5 + 4cos2θ). To find the maximum distance, we need to maximize sqrt(5 + 4cos2θ). Since sqrt is an increasing function, maximizing the expression inside will maximize the distance.So, let's focus on maximizing 5 + 4cos2θ. The maximum value of cos2θ is 1, so the maximum of 5 + 4cos2θ is 5 + 4*1 = 9. Therefore, the maximum distance is sqrt(9) = 3.Okay, that confirms my earlier geometric intuition. So, the maximum distance is 3.But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the law of cosines in polar coordinates. The distance between two points (ρ1, θ1) and (ρ2, θ2) in polar coordinates is given by sqrt(ρ1² + ρ2² - 2ρ1ρ2 cos(θ1 - θ2)). In this case, one point is on the curve ρ = 2cosθ, so ρ1 = 2cosθ, θ1 = θ. The other point is (1, π), so ρ2 = 1, θ2 = π. So, the distance squared between them is:(2cosθ)^2 + 1^2 - 2*(2cosθ)*1*cos(θ - π).Let me compute that:4cos²θ + 1 - 4cosθ cos(θ - π).Now, cos(θ - π) is equal to -cosθ because cos(θ - π) = cosθ cosπ + sinθ sinπ = -cosθ + 0 = -cosθ. So, substituting that in:4cos²θ + 1 - 4cosθ*(-cosθ) = 4cos²θ + 1 + 4cos²θ = 8cos²θ + 1.Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Earlier, I had 5 + 4cos2θ, and now I have 8cos²θ + 1. Let me see if these are equivalent.We know that cos2θ = 2cos²θ - 1, so 8cos²θ = 4*(2cos²θ) = 4*(1 + cos2θ). Therefore, 8cos²θ + 1 = 4*(1 + cos2θ) + 1 = 4 + 4cos2θ + 1 = 5 + 4cos2θ. Oh, okay, so they are the same. So, that's consistent.So, the distance squared is 5 + 4cos2θ, which we already determined has a maximum of 9, so the maximum distance is 3.Therefore, regardless of the method I use, I get the same result. That gives me more confidence that 3 is indeed the correct answer.Just to recap, the steps I took were:1. Convert both points to Cartesian coordinates to visualize the problem.2. Recognize that the curve is a circle and the point is another point on the Cartesian plane.3. Calculate the distance between the centers of the circle and the point, then add the radius to find the maximum distance.4. Verify this result by parameterizing the curve and using the distance formula.5. Cross-check using the law of cosines in polar coordinates to ensure consistency.All methods led me to the same conclusion, so I feel confident that the maximum distance is 3.**Final Answer**The maximum distance is boxed{3}."},{"question":"If 2^{x}=5 and 4^{y}=3, then the value of 2^{x+2y} is ____.","answer":"To solve the problem, I start by expressing all terms with the same base.

Using the properties of exponents, I can split this into (2^x times 2^{2y}). From the given equations, I know that (2^x = 5) and (2^{2y} = 3).

Prove that the sum of all the numbers in the table is equal to one.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a rectangular table filled with positive numbers. The condition given is that for any column and any row, the product of the sum of the numbers in that column and the sum of the numbers in that row is equal to the number where they intersect. I need to prove that the sum of all the numbers in the table is equal to one.Hmm, let me try to break this down. Let's denote the table as a matrix with m rows and n columns. So, each entry in the table can be represented as a_{i,j}, where i is the row number and j is the column number.The sum of the numbers in row i would be R_i = a_{i,1} + a_{i,2} + ... + a_{i,n}. Similarly, the sum of the numbers in column j would be C_j = a_{1,j} + a_{2,j} + ... + a_{m,j}.According to the problem, for any row i and column j, the product R_i * C_j equals a_{i,j}. So, mathematically, that's:R_i * C_j = a_{i,j} for all i, j.Okay, so each entry in the table is the product of the sum of its row and the sum of its column. Interesting. Now, I need to find the total sum of all the numbers in the table, which would be the sum of all R_i's or equivalently the sum of all C_j's.Let me denote the total sum as S. So, S = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_m = C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_n.Since each a_{i,j} is equal to R_i * C_j, the total sum S can also be expressed as the sum over all i and j of R_i * C_j. So,S = Σ_{i=1 to m} Σ_{j=1 to n} R_i * C_j.But wait, that's the same as (Σ_{i=1 to m} R_i) * (Σ_{j=1 to n} C_j) because it's the product of two sums. So, S = (Σ R_i) * (Σ C_j). But Σ R_i is S and Σ C_j is also S. Therefore, S = S * S, which implies S^2 = S.So, S^2 = S. That means S(S - 1) = 0. Therefore, S = 0 or S = 1.But the problem states that all numbers in the table are positive. So, the total sum S cannot be zero because all terms are positive. Therefore, S must be equal to 1.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify if I missed anything.First, I defined R_i as the sum of row i and C_j as the sum of column j. Then, each a_{i,j} is R_i * C_j. Then, the total sum S is the sum of all a_{i,j}, which is the double sum over i and j of R_i * C_j. Since R_i is independent of j and C_j is independent of i, I can factor this as (sum R_i) * (sum C_j). But sum R_i is S and sum C_j is also S, so S = S^2, leading to S = 1.Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the sum of all numbers in the table must be 1.**Final Answer**The sum of all the numbers in the table is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Nonzero real numbers x, y, a, and b satisfy x < a and y < b.

Find the value of f(3).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"The graph of the power function f(x) passes through the point (-2, 4). Find the value of f(3).\\" Hmm, power function. I remember that power functions are of the form f(x) = k * x^n, where k is a constant and n is the exponent. So, I need to figure out what k and n are, right?Wait, but the problem doesn't give me another point or any other information. It just says it's a power function and it passes through (-2, 4). Hmm, so maybe I need to make some assumptions here. Power functions can have different exponents, but without more information, I might not be able to determine both k and n uniquely. Hmm, maybe the problem expects me to consider a specific type of power function, like a monomial function with integer exponents?Let me think. If f(x) is a power function, it's generally f(x) = kx^n. Since it passes through (-2, 4), that means when x is -2, f(x) is 4. So, plugging that in, I get 4 = k*(-2)^n. Okay, so I have one equation with two variables, k and n. Without another point, I can't solve for both. So maybe the problem is expecting me to assume a specific exponent? Or perhaps the exponent is an integer, and maybe it's even or odd?Wait, maybe the function is a simple power function with a common exponent, like n=2 or n=3. Let me try n=2 first. If n=2, then 4 = k*(-2)^2 = k*4. So, k would be 4/4 = 1. So, f(x) = x^2. Then, f(3) would be 9. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But wait, is n=2 the only possibility? What if n=3? Then, 4 = k*(-2)^3 = k*(-8). So, k would be 4/(-8) = -0.5. So, f(x) = -0.5x^3. Then, f(3) would be -0.5*(27) = -13.5. Hmm, so depending on the exponent, the value of f(3) changes.But the problem doesn't specify the exponent, so how can I know which one it is? Maybe I need to consider that power functions can have any real exponent, but without more information, the problem is underdetermined. Wait, but maybe the question assumes that the exponent is an integer, and perhaps it's even or odd. Let me see.If n is even, then (-2)^n will be positive, so k would be positive. If n is odd, then (-2)^n will be negative, so k would be negative. So, in the first case, n=2 gives k=1, which is positive, and in the second case, n=3 gives k=-0.5, which is negative. So, both are possible.But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to consider that the simplest power function is a monomial with integer exponent, and perhaps the smallest possible exponent? Or maybe it's a square function, which is a common power function.Wait, but the problem says \\"the power function,\\" implying that there's a unique answer. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the problem again: \\"The graph of the power function f(x) passes through the point (-2, 4). Find the value of f(3).\\" Hmm, maybe the function is defined for all real numbers, so if n is even, then f(x) is defined for all x, but if n is odd, it's also defined for all x. So, both cases are possible.Wait, but maybe the function is a monomial function, which is a single term, so f(x) = kx^n. Since it's a power function, it's a monomial. So, without more points, I can't determine both k and n. So, maybe the problem is expecting me to assume that the exponent is 2, making it a quadratic function, which is a common power function.Alternatively, maybe the function is linear, but that would be a power function with n=1, so f(x)=kx. Then, plugging in (-2,4), we get 4 = k*(-2), so k = -2. Then, f(3) would be -6. Hmm, so that's another possibility.Wait, so depending on the exponent, we get different results. So, how can the problem be solved without more information? Maybe I need to consider that power functions can have any real exponent, but perhaps the problem expects an integer exponent, and maybe the smallest positive integer exponent that works.Wait, let's try n=1: f(x)=kx. Then, 4 = k*(-2), so k = -2. Then, f(3) = -6.n=2: f(x)=x^2, f(3)=9.n=3: f(x)=-0.5x^3, f(3)=-13.5.n=4: f(x)=k*(-2)^4=16k=4, so k=4/16=0.25. Then, f(3)=0.25*(81)=20.25.So, depending on n, f(3) can be -6, 9, -13.5, 20.25, etc. So, without knowing n, I can't determine f(3). Therefore, the problem must have more information, or perhaps I'm missing something.Wait, maybe the function is a square function because it's a power function, and square functions are common. So, maybe the answer is 9. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the function is a cube function, but then f(3) would be -13.5.Wait, but the problem says \\"the power function,\\" which is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it's expecting me to assume that the exponent is 2, so f(x)=x^2, which passes through (-2,4) because (-2)^2=4. So, then f(3)=9.Alternatively, maybe the function is f(x)=x^2, which is a power function, and that's the simplest case. So, maybe the answer is 9.But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the function is f(x)=kx^n, and it passes through (-2,4), then 4 = k*(-2)^n. So, k = 4 / (-2)^n. So, f(3) = k*3^n = (4 / (-2)^n) * 3^n = 4*(3/(-2))^n.Hmm, so f(3) = 4*(3/(-2))^n. So, depending on n, this can be positive or negative, and different magnitudes.But without knowing n, I can't compute f(3). So, maybe the problem is expecting me to assume that the exponent is 2, making f(x)=x^2, so f(3)=9.Alternatively, maybe the function is f(x)=x^2, which is a power function, and that's the answer.Wait, but let me check: if f(x)=x^2, then f(-2)=4, which matches the given point. So, that works. So, f(3)=9.Alternatively, if the function is f(x)=x^3, then f(-2)=-8, which doesn't match 4. So, that's not possible. So, if n=3, then k would have to be negative, as I calculated earlier: k=-0.5, so f(x)=-0.5x^3.So, f(-2)=-0.5*(-8)=4, which works. So, that's another possibility.So, both n=2 and n=3 are possible, leading to different f(3) values.Wait, so maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the function is even, so n is even, making f(x) symmetric. So, f(3)=9.Alternatively, maybe the function is odd, so n is odd, leading to f(3)=-13.5.But without more information, I can't determine which one it is.Wait, but maybe the function is a monomial function with integer exponent, and the smallest possible exponent. So, n=1: f(x)=-2x, f(3)=-6.n=2: f(x)=x^2, f(3)=9.n=3: f(x)=-0.5x^3, f(3)=-13.5.So, which one is it? Hmm.Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the function is a square function, so n=2, so f(x)=x^2, so f(3)=9.Alternatively, maybe the function is a cube function, but then f(-2)=4 would require k=-0.5, so f(3)=-13.5.But without more information, I can't be sure.Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that power functions can have any exponent, but perhaps it's expecting the simplest case, which is n=2, so f(x)=x^2, so f(3)=9.Alternatively, maybe the function is f(x)=x^2, which is a common power function, so that's the answer.Wait, but let me think again. If I assume n=2, then f(x)=x^2, which passes through (-2,4), so that's correct. Then, f(3)=9.Alternatively, if I assume n=1, then f(x)=-2x, which also passes through (-2,4), so f(3)=-6.So, both are possible. So, how can I know which one is correct?Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the function is a square function, so n=2, so f(3)=9.Alternatively, maybe the function is a linear function, so n=1, so f(3)=-6.But without more information, I can't determine which one it is.Wait, but maybe the problem is expecting me to assume that the exponent is even, so n=2, so f(3)=9.Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to assume that the exponent is 2, so f(x)=x^2, so f(3)=9.Hmm, I think I need to make an assumption here, as the problem doesn't provide enough information. So, I'll go with the simplest case, which is n=2, so f(x)=x^2, so f(3)=9.Alternatively, maybe the function is f(x)=x^2, which is a power function, so f(3)=9.Wait, but let me check: if f(x)=x^2, then f(-2)=4, which matches the given point. So, that's correct.Alternatively, if f(x)=x^3, then f(-2)=-8, which doesn't match 4, so that's not possible unless k is adjusted, which would make it a different function.So, maybe the answer is 9.Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider that the function is f(x)=x^2, so f(3)=9.Alternatively, if the function is f(x)=x^2, then f(3)=9.So, I think I'll go with that."},{"question":"Ziggy is a club DJ.

Find the smallest integer ( m ) such that there exist two sets of integers ( A ) and ( B ) satisfying the following conditions:1. ( |A| = n ), ( |B| = m ), and ( A subseteq B ).2. For any two different elements ( x ) and ( y ) in set ( B ), ( x+y in B ) if and only if ( x, y in A ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest integer ( m ) given an integer ( n geq 5 ). The conditions are that there exist two sets of integers ( A ) and ( B ) such that:1. ( |A| = n ), ( |B| = m ), and ( A subseteq B ).2. For any two different elements ( x ) and ( y ) in set ( B ), ( x + y in B ) if and only if ( x, y in A ).Hmm, let me try to unpack this.First, ( A ) is a subset of ( B ), and ( A ) has ( n ) elements while ( B ) has ( m ) elements. The key condition is about the sum of any two distinct elements in ( B ). If both elements are in ( A ), then their sum must also be in ( B ). Conversely, if their sum is in ( B ), then both elements must be in ( A ). So, the sumset ( A + A ) is contained within ( B ), and any sum in ( B ) must come from elements in ( A ).So, in other words, ( B ) must contain all the sums of two distinct elements from ( A ), and nothing else. That is, ( B = A cup (A + A) ). But wait, is that necessarily the case? Or could ( B ) have some other elements as well?Wait, the condition says that for any two different elements ( x ) and ( y ) in ( B ), ( x + y in B ) if and only if ( x, y in A ). So, if ( x ) and ( y ) are both in ( A ), then ( x + y ) must be in ( B ). If ( x ) or ( y ) is not in ( A ), then ( x + y ) should not be in ( B ). So, ( B ) must contain all sums of two elements from ( A ), but no other sums.Therefore, ( B ) is exactly ( A cup (A + A) ). So, ( B ) is the union of ( A ) and the sumset of ( A ). Therefore, ( m = |B| = |A| + |A + A| - |A cap (A + A)| ). But since ( A subseteq B ), and ( A + A ) is a set of sums, which are likely larger than the elements in ( A ), unless ( A ) contains negative numbers or zero.Wait, the problem says integers, so they can be positive, negative, or zero. Hmm, but if ( A ) is a set of integers, then ( A + A ) could potentially overlap with ( A ) if, for example, ( A ) contains zero or negative numbers.But let's think about this. If ( A ) is a set of positive integers, then ( A + A ) will consist of numbers larger than any element in ( A ). So, in that case, ( A ) and ( A + A ) are disjoint, so ( |B| = |A| + |A + A| ).But if ( A ) includes zero or negative numbers, then ( A + A ) might overlap with ( A ). For instance, if ( A ) contains zero, then ( x + 0 = x ) for any ( x in A ), so ( x ) would be in ( A + A ). Similarly, if ( A ) contains negative numbers, adding a negative and a positive could give an element in ( A ).So, perhaps to minimize ( m ), we can arrange ( A ) such that ( A + A ) overlaps as much as possible with ( A ). That way, ( |B| ) would be minimized.But wait, the problem says \\"for any two different elements ( x ) and ( y ) in ( B ), ( x + y in B ) if and only if ( x, y in A ).\\" So, if ( x ) or ( y ) is not in ( A ), then ( x + y ) should not be in ( B ). So, if ( A + A ) overlaps with ( A ), that is, if some elements of ( A ) can be expressed as the sum of two elements of ( A ), then those elements would be in both ( A ) and ( A + A ). But according to the condition, if ( x, y in A ), then ( x + y in B ). So, that's fine. But if ( x ) or ( y ) is not in ( A ), then ( x + y ) must not be in ( B ).Therefore, if ( A + A ) overlaps with ( A ), that is, if ( A ) is closed under addition for some elements, then ( B ) would include those overlapping elements. But we have to ensure that no other sums outside ( A ) are included in ( B ).So, perhaps the minimal ( m ) is achieved when ( A ) is an additive basis of order 2, but only within itself. Wait, maybe it's similar to a concept in additive number theory.Alternatively, perhaps ( A ) is a set such that ( A + A ) is as small as possible, but still, the condition is that all sums of two elements from ( A ) are in ( B ), and no other sums are in ( B ).Wait, but ( B ) must contain all sums of two elements from ( A ), and no other sums. So, ( B ) is exactly ( A cup (A + A) ). So, ( m = |A| + |A + A| - |A cap (A + A)| ).Therefore, to minimize ( m ), we need to maximize the overlap between ( A ) and ( A + A ). So, the more elements in ( A ) that can be written as the sum of two elements in ( A ), the smaller ( m ) will be.So, perhaps if ( A ) is an arithmetic progression? Let's see.Suppose ( A ) is an arithmetic progression. Let's say ( A = {a, a + d, a + 2d, ldots, a + (n - 1)d} ). Then, ( A + A ) would be ( {2a, 2a + d, 2a + 2d, ldots, 2a + 2(n - 1)d} ). So, ( A + A ) is another arithmetic progression with the same difference ( d ), starting at ( 2a ) and ending at ( 2a + 2(n - 1)d ).So, the overlap between ( A ) and ( A + A ) would depend on the starting point ( a ) and the common difference ( d ). If ( a ) is chosen such that ( 2a ) is equal to some element in ( A ), then there would be an overlap.For example, if ( a = 0 ), then ( A = {0, d, 2d, ldots, (n - 1)d} ), and ( A + A = {0, d, 2d, ldots, 2(n - 1)d} ). So, in this case, ( A ) is a subset of ( A + A ), so ( A cap (A + A) = A ). Therefore, ( |A + A| = 2n - 1 ), since it's an arithmetic progression from ( 0 ) to ( 2(n - 1)d ) with difference ( d ). So, ( |B| = |A| + |A + A| - |A| = |A + A| = 2n - 1 ). So, ( m = 2n - 1 ).But wait, is this the minimal possible ( m )?Wait, if ( A ) is an arithmetic progression starting at 0, then ( A + A ) is another arithmetic progression with double the length. So, in this case, ( m = 2n - 1 ). But maybe we can do better by choosing a different structure for ( A ).Alternatively, suppose ( A ) is a set containing both positive and negative numbers. For example, if ( A ) is symmetric around 0, like ( A = {-k, -(k - 1), ldots, 0, ldots, (k - 1), k} ). Then, ( A + A ) would include numbers from ( -2k ) to ( 2k ). However, in this case, ( A + A ) would be larger, so ( m ) would be larger as well. So, that might not help in minimizing ( m ).Alternatively, perhaps if ( A ) is a geometric progression? Hmm, but the sumset of a geometric progression is not necessarily a progression, and it might not overlap much with ( A ), so that might not help.Wait, another thought: if ( A ) is a set where every element can be written as the sum of two other elements in ( A ), except for maybe the smallest element. Then, ( A + A ) would overlap significantly with ( A ), minimizing ( m ).For example, suppose ( A ) is a set where each element after the first is the sum of the two previous elements. Like a Fibonacci sequence. But then, the sumset ( A + A ) would include elements that are sums of any two elements, which could be more than just the next element.Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Let's think about specific small cases.Given that ( n geq 5 ), let's try ( n = 5 ) first to see if we can find a pattern.Suppose ( n = 5 ). Let me try to construct ( A ) such that ( A + A ) overlaps as much as possible with ( A ).Let me try ( A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ). Then, ( A + A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ). So, ( B = A cup (A + A) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ). So, ( |B| = 9 ). So, ( m = 9 ).But is this minimal? Let's see if we can construct ( A ) such that ( A + A ) overlaps more with ( A ).Suppose ( A = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5} ). Then, ( A + A ) would include:0+0=0, 0+1=1, 0+3=3, 0+4=4, 0+5=5,1+1=2, 1+3=4, 1+4=5, 1+5=6,3+3=6, 3+4=7, 3+5=8,4+4=8, 4+5=9,5+5=10.So, ( A + A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ). So, ( B = A cup (A + A) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ). So, ( |B| = 11 ), which is worse than the previous case.Hmm, maybe another approach. Let me try ( A = {0, 1, 2, 4, 5} ). Then, ( A + A ) would be:0+0=0, 0+1=1, 0+2=2, 0+4=4, 0+5=5,1+1=2, 1+2=3, 1+4=5, 1+5=6,2+2=4, 2+4=6, 2+5=7,4+4=8, 4+5=9,5+5=10.So, ( A + A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ). So, again, ( |B| = 11 ). Hmm, same as before.Wait, perhaps if I include negative numbers. Let me try ( A = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} ). Then, ( A + A ) would be:-2 + (-2) = -4,-2 + (-1) = -3,-2 + 0 = -2,-2 + 1 = -1,-2 + 2 = 0,-1 + (-1) = -2,-1 + 0 = -1,-1 + 1 = 0,-1 + 2 = 1,0 + 0 = 0,0 + 1 = 1,0 + 2 = 2,1 + 1 = 2,1 + 2 = 3,2 + 2 = 4.So, ( A + A = {-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ). So, ( B = A cup (A + A) = {-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ). So, ( |B| = 9 ), same as the first case.But in this case, ( A ) is symmetric around 0, which might help in overlapping more sums. However, the size of ( B ) is still 9, same as when ( A ) was {0,1,2,3,4}.Wait, is 9 the minimal ( m ) for ( n = 5 )? Let me see.Is there a way to make ( B ) smaller? Let's try another ( A ).Suppose ( A = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5} ). Wait, I tried this earlier, and ( B ) was 11, which is worse.Alternatively, what if ( A ) is not an arithmetic progression? Let me try ( A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5} ). Then, ( A + A ) would be:0+0=0, 0+1=1, 0+2=2, 0+3=3, 0+5=5,1+1=2, 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+5=6,2+2=4, 2+3=5, 2+5=7,3+3=6, 3+5=8,5+5=10.So, ( A + A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10} ). So, ( B = A cup (A + A) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10} ). So, ( |B| = 10 ), which is better than 11 but worse than 9.Hmm. So, so far, the minimal ( m ) I can get for ( n = 5 ) is 9.Wait, is 9 actually the minimal? Let me think.If ( A ) is an arithmetic progression starting at 0, then ( A + A ) is another arithmetic progression with double the length, so ( |A + A| = 2n - 1 ). So, for ( n = 5 ), ( |A + A| = 9 ). Therefore, ( B = A cup (A + A) ) would have ( |B| = 9 ) since ( A ) is a subset of ( A + A ).Wait, is that the case? If ( A ) is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, then ( A + A ) is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, so ( A ) is indeed a subset of ( A + A ). Therefore, ( |B| = |A + A| = 9 ).So, in this case, ( m = 9 ) for ( n = 5 ). Is this minimal? Let me see if I can find a set ( A ) where ( |B| < 9 ).Suppose ( A ) is a set where ( A + A ) overlaps more with ( A ). For example, if ( A ) contains elements such that adding two elements gives another element in ( A ). For instance, if ( A ) is a union of smaller arithmetic progressions.Wait, let's try ( A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ) as before. Then, ( A + A ) is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, so ( B = A + A ), which has size 9.Alternatively, if ( A ) is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}, then ( A + A ) is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16}, so ( B = A cup (A + A) = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16} ), which also has size 9. So, same as before.Wait, but in this case, ( A + A ) doesn't overlap with ( A ) except for the even numbers. But since ( A ) is a subset of ( A + A ), the size is still 9.Wait, so regardless of the structure of ( A ), as long as ( A ) is an arithmetic progression starting at 0, ( |B| = 2n - 1 ). So, for ( n = 5 ), ( m = 9 ).But is this the minimal? Let me think differently.Suppose ( A ) is a set where ( A + A ) is exactly ( A ). That is, ( A ) is closed under addition. But for ( A ) to be closed under addition, it must be an additive semigroup. The smallest such set is the set of non-negative integers, but that's infinite. So, for a finite set, it's impossible unless ( A ) is trivial, which it's not because ( n geq 5 ).Therefore, ( A + A ) must be larger than ( A ). So, the minimal ( |B| ) is ( |A| + |A + A| - |A cap (A + A)| ). To minimize ( |B| ), we need to maximize ( |A cap (A + A)| ).So, the more elements in ( A ) that can be expressed as the sum of two elements in ( A ), the smaller ( |B| ) will be. So, perhaps the minimal ( |B| ) is achieved when ( A ) is an arithmetic progression starting at 0, because in that case, ( A ) is a subset of ( A + A ), so ( |A cap (A + A)| = |A| ), and ( |B| = |A + A| = 2n - 1 ).But wait, let me check for ( n = 5 ). If ( A ) is an arithmetic progression starting at 0, then ( |A + A| = 2n - 1 = 9 ), so ( |B| = 9 ). If I can find another set ( A ) where ( |A + A| < 9 ), then ( |B| ) would be smaller.But for ( n = 5 ), the minimal possible ( |A + A| ) is 9, because if ( A ) is an arithmetic progression, ( |A + A| = 2n - 1 ). For other sets, ( |A + A| ) can be larger, but not smaller. So, 9 is indeed the minimal ( |B| ) for ( n = 5 ).Similarly, for general ( n ), if ( A ) is an arithmetic progression starting at 0, then ( |A + A| = 2n - 1 ), and ( |B| = 2n - 1 ). So, perhaps ( m = 2n - 1 ) is the minimal.But wait, let me test for ( n = 6 ). If ( A ) is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then ( A + A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ), so ( |B| = 11 ). Which is ( 2*6 - 1 = 11 ). So, same pattern.But is there a way to have ( |B| ) smaller than ( 2n - 1 )?Wait, suppose ( A ) is a set where some elements can be expressed as the sum of two elements in ( A ). For example, if ( A ) contains 0 and 1, then 1 can be expressed as 0 + 1, but that doesn't help. Wait, no, 1 is already in ( A ).Wait, if ( A ) contains 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, then ( A + A ) would include 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. So, ( |A + A| = 13 ), which is larger than ( 2n - 1 = 11 ). So, that's worse.Alternatively, if ( A ) is a set where some elements are the sum of two others, but not necessarily in an arithmetic progression.Wait, for example, let me take ( A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ). Then, ( A + A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ), which is size 11. So, ( |B| = 11 ).Alternatively, suppose ( A = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6} ). Then, ( A + A ) would be:0+0=0,0+1=1,0+3=3,0+4=4,0+5=5,0+6=6,1+1=2,1+3=4,1+4=5,1+5=6,1+6=7,3+3=6,3+4=7,3+5=8,3+6=9,4+4=8,4+5=9,4+6=10,5+5=10,5+6=11,6+6=12.So, ( A + A = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} ), which is size 13. So, ( |B| = 13 ), which is worse.Hmm, so it seems that when ( A ) is an arithmetic progression starting at 0, ( |A + A| = 2n - 1 ), which gives the minimal ( |B| ).Therefore, perhaps for general ( n geq 5 ), the minimal ( m ) is ( 2n - 1 ).But let me think again. Suppose ( A ) is not an arithmetic progression. For example, suppose ( A ) is a set where some elements are the sum of two others, but arranged in a way that ( A + A ) overlaps more with ( A ).Wait, for example, let me take ( A = {0, 1, 2, 4, 8} ). Then, ( A + A ) would be:0+0=0,0+1=1,0+2=2,0+4=4,0+8=8,1+1=2,1+2=3,1+4=5,1+8=9,2+2=4,2+4=6,2+8=10,4+4=8,4+8=12,8+8=16.So, ( A + A = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,16} ). So, ( |A + A| = 12 ). Then, ( B = A cup (A + A) = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,16} ). So, ( |B| = 12 ). For ( n = 5 ), this is worse than the arithmetic progression case where ( |B| = 9 ).So, this approach doesn't help.Wait, another idea: if ( A ) is a set where every element beyond a certain point is the sum of two smaller elements. For example, like a sumset basis.Wait, but I think that in general, the minimal ( |A + A| ) is achieved when ( A ) is an arithmetic progression, which gives ( |A + A| = 2n - 1 ). So, perhaps ( m = 2n - 1 ) is indeed the minimal.But let me check for ( n = 5 ). If ( A ) is an arithmetic progression starting at 0, then ( |B| = 9 ). If I can find a set ( A ) where ( |B| < 9 ), then ( m ) would be smaller. But I can't seem to find such a set.Wait, another thought: suppose ( A ) is a set where the smallest element is not 0. For example, ( A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ). Then, ( A + A = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ). So, ( B = A cup (A + A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ). So, ( |B| = 10 ), which is larger than 9. So, worse.Alternatively, if ( A ) starts at a negative number. Let me try ( A = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} ). Then, ( A + A = {-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ). So, ( B = A cup (A + A) = {-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ). So, ( |B| = 9 ), same as the arithmetic progression starting at 0.So, whether ( A ) starts at 0 or includes negative numbers, the minimal ( |B| ) seems to be 9 for ( n = 5 ).Therefore, it seems that the minimal ( m ) is ( 2n - 1 ).But let me think again. Suppose ( A ) is a set where some elements are the sum of two others, so that ( A + A ) overlaps with ( A ). For example, let me take ( A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ). Then, ( A + A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ). So, ( B = A + A ), which has size 9.But if I take ( A = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5} ), then ( A + A ) is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, which is larger, so ( |B| = 11 ), which is worse.Alternatively, if I take ( A = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5} ), then ( A + A ) is:0+0=0,0+2=2,0+3=3,0+4=4,0+5=5,2+2=4,2+3=5,2+4=6,2+5=7,3+3=6,3+4=7,3+5=8,4+4=8,4+5=9,5+5=10.So, ( A + A = {0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} ). So, ( |A + A| = 10 ). Then, ( B = A cup (A + A) = {0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} ). So, ( |B| = 10 ), which is worse than 9.So, again, the arithmetic progression starting at 0 gives the minimal ( |B| ).Therefore, it seems that the minimal ( m ) is ( 2n - 1 ).But let me think about another structure. Suppose ( A ) is a set where the elements are arranged such that each element is the sum of two previous elements. For example, like a Fibonacci sequence. Let me try ( A = {0, 1, 1, 2, 3} ). Wait, but sets cannot have duplicate elements, so ( A = {0, 1, 2, 3} ), but ( n = 4 ), which is less than 5. So, not applicable.Alternatively, ( A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5} ). Then, ( A + A ) is:0+0=0,0+1=1,0+2=2,0+3=3,0+5=5,1+1=2,1+2=3,1+3=4,1+5=6,2+2=4,2+3=5,2+5=7,3+3=6,3+5=8,5+5=10.So, ( A + A = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10} ). So, ( |A + A| = 10 ). Then, ( B = A cup (A + A) = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10} ). So, ( |B| = 10 ), which is worse than 9.So, again, the arithmetic progression gives a better result.Therefore, it seems that the minimal ( m ) is indeed ( 2n - 1 ).But wait, let me think about another case. Suppose ( A ) is a set where some elements are the sum of two others, but in a way that ( A + A ) doesn't add too many new elements.Wait, for example, let me take ( A = {0, 1, 2, 4, 5} ). Then, ( A + A ) is:0+0=0,0+1=1,0+2=2,0+4=4,0+5=5,1+1=2,1+2=3,1+4=5,1+5=6,2+2=4,2+4=6,2+5=7,4+4=8,4+5=9,5+5=10.So, ( A + A = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} ). So, ( |A + A| = 11 ). Then, ( B = A cup (A + A) = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} ). So, ( |B| = 11 ), which is worse than 9.So, again, the arithmetic progression is better.Therefore, after trying several examples, it seems that the minimal ( m ) is achieved when ( A ) is an arithmetic progression starting at 0, which gives ( |B| = 2n - 1 ).But wait, let me think about another structure. Suppose ( A ) is a set where all elements are even numbers. For example, ( A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} ). Then, ( A + A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16} ). So, ( |A + A| = 9 ). Then, ( B = A cup (A + A) = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16} ). So, ( |B| = 9 ), same as the arithmetic progression starting at 0.So, in this case, ( A ) is an arithmetic progression with difference 2, and ( |B| = 9 ).Therefore, whether ( A ) is an arithmetic progression with difference 1 or 2, as long as it's an arithmetic progression starting at 0, ( |B| = 2n - 1 ).So, for general ( n geq 5 ), the minimal ( m ) is ( 2n - 1 ).But wait, let me think about another case. Suppose ( A ) is a set where some elements are the sum of two others, but arranged in a way that ( A + A ) overlaps more with ( A ). For example, if ( A ) contains 0 and 1, then 1 can be expressed as 0 + 1, but that doesn't help because 1 is already in ( A ).Wait, another idea: if ( A ) is a set where the smallest element is 0, and the next elements are arranged such that each element is the sum of the previous two. For example, ( A = {0, 1, 1, 2, 3} ). But again, sets cannot have duplicates, so ( A = {0, 1, 2, 3} ), which is ( n = 4 ), less than 5.Alternatively, ( A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5} ). Then, ( A + A ) is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}, which is size 10, so ( |B| = 10 ), which is worse than 9.So, again, the arithmetic progression gives a better result.Therefore, I think it's safe to conclude that the minimal ( m ) is ( 2n - 1 ).But let me think about the problem statement again. It says \\"for any two different elements ( x ) and ( y ) in set ( B ), ( x + y in B ) if and only if ( x, y in A ).\\"So, in other words, ( B ) must satisfy that the sum of any two distinct elements is in ( B ) only if both are in ( A ). So, ( B ) is closed under addition only for pairs from ( A ), and no other pairs.Therefore, ( B ) must be exactly ( A cup (A + A) ), and ( A + A ) must not contain any sums from elements outside ( A ).Wait, but if ( A ) is an arithmetic progression starting at 0, then ( A + A ) is another arithmetic progression, and ( B = A + A ). So, in this case, ( A subseteq B ), and any sum of two elements in ( B ) is in ( B ) only if both elements are in ( A ).Wait, no. If ( B = A + A ), then any two elements in ( B ) can be summed, but according to the condition, their sum should be in ( B ) only if both are in ( A ). But if ( B = A + A ), then any two elements in ( B ) are sums of elements in ( A ), so their sum would be in ( B + B ), which is larger than ( B ). Wait, this might not satisfy the condition.Wait, hold on. If ( B = A + A ), then ( B ) is closed under addition, because ( (A + A) + (A + A) = A + A + A + A ), which is larger than ( A + A ). So, ( B ) would not be closed under addition, which contradicts the condition.Wait, no, the condition is not that ( B ) is closed under addition, but rather that ( x + y in B ) if and only if ( x, y in A ). So, if ( x ) and ( y ) are in ( A ), then ( x + y ) is in ( B ). If ( x ) or ( y ) is not in ( A ), then ( x + y ) is not in ( B ).Therefore, ( B ) must contain all sums of two elements from ( A ), and no other sums. So, ( B = A cup (A + A) ), and ( (A + A) ) must not contain any sums from elements outside ( A ).Wait, but if ( B = A cup (A + A) ), then ( B ) contains ( A ) and all sums of two elements from ( A ). Now, if we take two elements from ( B ), say ( x ) and ( y ), then ( x + y ) is in ( B ) only if ( x, y in A ).But if ( x ) is in ( A + A ) and ( y ) is in ( A ), then ( x + y ) would be in ( (A + A) + A = A + A + A ). But ( A + A + A ) might not be a subset of ( B ), which is ( A cup (A + A) ). Therefore, ( x + y ) might not be in ( B ), which is fine because ( x ) is not in ( A ).Wait, but if ( x ) is in ( A + A ) and ( y ) is in ( A ), then ( x + y ) is in ( A + A + A ). But ( A + A + A ) is not necessarily a subset of ( B ), which is ( A cup (A + A) ). Therefore, ( x + y ) might not be in ( B ), which is acceptable because ( x ) is not in ( A ).Similarly, if both ( x ) and ( y ) are in ( A + A ), then ( x + y ) is in ( A + A + A + A ), which is even larger, so it's not in ( B ), which is fine because neither ( x ) nor ( y ) are in ( A ).Therefore, the condition is satisfied.So, in this case, ( B = A cup (A + A) ), and ( |B| = |A| + |A + A| - |A cap (A + A)| ).But if ( A ) is an arithmetic progression starting at 0, then ( A subseteq A + A ), so ( |A cap (A + A)| = |A| ). Therefore, ( |B| = |A + A| = 2n - 1 ).Therefore, the minimal ( m ) is ( 2n - 1 ).But wait, let me confirm with ( n = 5 ). If ( A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ), then ( A + A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ), so ( |B| = 9 ). And for ( n = 6 ), ( |B| = 11 ), which is ( 2*6 - 1 = 11 ).Therefore, it seems that the minimal ( m ) is ( 2n - 1 ).But wait, let me think about another case where ( A ) is not an arithmetic progression but still satisfies the condition with a smaller ( m ).Suppose ( A = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5} ). Then, ( A + A = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} ), so ( |B| = 11 ), which is larger than ( 2n - 1 = 9 ).Alternatively, suppose ( A = {0, 1, 2, 4, 5} ). Then, ( A + A = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} ), so ( |B| = 11 ), which is worse.Alternatively, suppose ( A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5} ). Then, ( A + A = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10} ), so ( |B| = 10 ), which is worse than 9.Therefore, it seems that the minimal ( m ) is indeed ( 2n - 1 ).Therefore, the answer is ( boxed{2n - 1} )."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:_},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},F=["disabled"],D={key:0},P={key:1};function z(a,e,h,m,o,n){const u=b("PoemCard");return i(),s("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 DeepSeek-R1 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",L,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[g,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",N,[(i(!0),s(w,null,y(n.filteredPoems,(r,f)=>(i(),x(u,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(i(),s("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...r))},[o.isLoading?(i(),s("span",P,"Loading...")):(i(),s("span",D,"See more"))],8,F)):v("",!0)])}const M=d(C,[["render",z],["__scopeId","data-v-d93c7b59"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"chatgpt/52.md","filePath":"chatgpt/52.md"}'),H={name:"chatgpt/52.md"},Y=Object.assign(H,{setup(a){return(e,h)=>(i(),s("div",null,[S(M)]))}});export{O as __pageData,Y as default};
