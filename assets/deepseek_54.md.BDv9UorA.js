However, the crust is consumed completely, whereas 15% of the bread always dries out. Assuming equal consumption, by what percentage do we spend more if we buy crust instead of bread?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about comparing the cost of buying crust versus white bread. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, the problem says that a crust is 25% lighter in weight than a white bread. Hmm, so if I consider the weight of white bread as a reference, the crust is lighter. Let me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the weight of white bread is W. Then, the weight of the crust would be W minus 25% of W, right? So that would be W * (1 - 0.25) = 0.75W. So the crust is 75% the weight of white bread.Next, it mentions that the crust is 20% more expensive. So if the price of white bread is P, then the price of the crust would be P plus 20% of P, which is P * 1.20. So, crust costs 1.2P.Now, the problem also states that the crust is consumed completely, whereas 15% of the bread always dries out. So, when we buy white bread, we only end up consuming 85% of it because 15% is wasted. On the other hand, the crust is all consumed, so 100% is used.The question is asking, assuming equal consumption, by what percentage do we spend more if we buy crust instead of bread? So, we need to compare the cost per unit of consumed weight for both crust and white bread.Let me structure this:1. For white bread:   - Weight: W   - Price: P   - Consumed weight: 85% of W = 0.85W   - So, cost per consumed weight = P / 0.85W2. For crust:   - Weight: 0.75W   - Price: 1.2P   - Consumed weight: 100% of 0.75W = 0.75W   - So, cost per consumed weight = 1.2P / 0.75WNow, let me compute both cost per consumed weight.Starting with white bread:Cost per consumed weight = P / 0.85W ≈ P / (0.85W) ≈ 1.176P/WFor crust:Cost per consumed weight = 1.2P / 0.75W = (1.2 / 0.75) * (P / W) = 1.6 * (P / W)So, now we have the cost per unit weight for both. Let me write them down:- White bread: ~1.176P/W- Crust: 1.6P/WTo find out how much more we spend if we buy crust instead of bread, we need to compare these two.First, let's find the ratio of crust's cost per consumed weight to white bread's cost per consumed weight.Ratio = (1.6P/W) / (1.176P/W) = 1.6 / 1.176 ≈ 1.36So, 1.36 times more expensive. To express this as a percentage, we subtract 1 and multiply by 100.Percentage increase = (1.36 - 1) * 100 = 0.36 * 100 = 36%Wait, so does that mean we spend 36% more if we buy crust instead of bread? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with the cost per consumed weight:White bread: P / 0.85W ≈ 1.176P/WCrust: 1.2P / 0.75W = 1.6P/WYes, that's correct. So, 1.6 divided by 1.176 is approximately 1.36, which is a 36% increase.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of cost per unit consumed.Let me assign a specific weight to white bread to make it more concrete. Let's say white bread weighs 100 grams. Then, crust would weigh 75 grams.Price of white bread: Let's say it's 1. So, crust would be 1.20.But wait, the problem says the crust is 20% more expensive. So, if white bread is 1, crust is 1.20.Now, for white bread, we only consume 85 grams (since 15% dries out). So, the cost per gram consumed is 1 / 85g ≈ 0.01176 per gram.For crust, we consume all 75 grams. So, the cost per gram is 1.20 / 75g = 0.016 per gram.Now, to find the percentage increase, we can calculate how much more expensive crust is per gram compared to white bread.Difference in cost per gram: 0.016 - 0.01176 = 0.00424Percentage increase: (0.00424 / 0.01176) * 100 ≈ (0.00424 / 0.01176) * 100 ≈ 0.36 * 100 = 36%Yes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, it seems like buying crust instead of bread results in spending approximately 36% more per gram of consumed product.Alternatively, another way to think about it is to compare the cost for the same amount of consumed weight.Suppose we want to consume X grams of bread. For white bread, since 15% is wasted, we need to buy X / 0.85 grams. For crust, since none is wasted, we just need to buy X grams.But wait, the crust is lighter. So, maybe I need to adjust for that.Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how much each provides in terms of consumed weight.Wait, maybe I can calculate the cost per 100 grams of consumed weight for both.For white bread:To get 100 grams consumed, you need to buy 100 / 0.85 ≈ 117.647 grams.At a price of P per 100 grams, the cost would be (117.647 / 100) * P ≈ 1.176P.For crust:To get 100 grams consumed, since it's 75% the weight, you need to buy 100 / 0.75 ≈ 133.333 grams.But wait, the crust is 20% more expensive. So, if white bread is P per 100 grams, crust is 1.2P per 100 grams.Wait, hold on, maybe I'm mixing up the units here. Let me clarify.Let me define:Let’s assume that white bread is priced at P dollars per 100 grams. Then, the crust is 20% more expensive, so it's 1.2P dollars per 100 grams.But the crust is 25% lighter, so 100 grams of crust would be equivalent to 75 grams of white bread in weight.Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Let me try a different approach.Let’s consider the cost per unit weight for both, considering the waste.For white bread:- Price: P- Weight: W- Consumed: 0.85W- Cost per consumed weight: P / 0.85WFor crust:- Price: 1.2P- Weight: 0.75W- Consumed: 0.75W- Cost per consumed weight: 1.2P / 0.75W = 1.6P / WSo, comparing the two:White bread cost per consumed weight: P / 0.85W ≈ 1.176P / WCrust cost per consumed weight: 1.6P / WSo, the ratio is 1.6 / 1.176 ≈ 1.36, which is a 36% increase.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, let's use actual numbers to test.Let’s say white bread costs 4 for 100 grams.Then, crust would cost 20% more, so 4.80 for 100 grams.But wait, the crust is 25% lighter, so 100 grams of crust is equivalent to 75 grams of white bread.Wait, no, actually, the crust is 25% lighter in weight than white bread. So, if white bread is 100 grams, crust is 75 grams.So, if white bread is 4 for 100 grams, crust is 20% more expensive, so 4.80 for 75 grams.Now, for white bread, 100 grams, but 15% dries out, so we consume 85 grams.So, the cost per consumed gram is 4 / 85g ≈ 0.047 per gram.For crust, 75 grams, all consumed, so cost per gram is 4.80 / 75g = 0.064 per gram.So, the cost per gram for crust is 0.064, compared to 0.047 for white bread.Difference: 0.064 - 0.047 = 0.017Percentage increase: (0.017 / 0.047) * 100 ≈ 36.17%, which is approximately 36%.So, that's consistent with my previous calculations.Therefore, buying crust instead of white bread results in spending approximately 36% more per gram of consumed product.I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning now. So, the answer should be a 36% increase in spending.**Final Answer**We spend boxed{36%} more if we buy crust instead of bread."},{"question":"In triangle ( triangle ABC ), ( BC = AC - 1 ) and ( AC = AB - 1 ). If ( cos(angle BAC) = frac{3}{5} ), determine the perimeter of ( triangle ABC ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this triangle ABC, and I need to find its perimeter. Let me jot down the given information first to get a clear picture.First, the problem states:- BC = AC - 1- AC = AB - 1- cos(angle BAC) = 3/5Hmm, okay. So, let me assign some variables to the sides to make it easier. Let's denote the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C as a, b, c respectively. Wait, actually, in standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C. So, in triangle ABC, side BC is opposite angle A, side AC is opposite angle B, and side AB is opposite angle C.But wait, let me make sure. In triangle ABC, vertex A is opposite side BC, vertex B opposite side AC, and vertex C opposite side AB. So, if I denote:- BC = a- AC = b- AB = cThen, according to the problem:1. BC = AC - 1 => a = b - 12. AC = AB - 1 => b = c - 1So, from these two equations, I can express all sides in terms of one variable. Let me see:From equation 2: b = c - 1 => c = b + 1From equation 1: a = b - 1So, sides are:- a = b - 1- b = b- c = b + 1So, all sides expressed in terms of b. That's helpful.Now, we also know that cos(angle BAC) = 3/5. Angle BAC is angle A, so we can use the Law of Cosines here. The Law of Cosines states that:c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C)But in this case, angle A is between sides AB and AC, which are sides c and b respectively. So, applying the Law of Cosines to angle A:BC² = AB² + AC² - 2 * AB * AC * cos(angle BAC)Which translates to:a² = c² + b² - 2bc * (3/5)Substituting the expressions for a and c in terms of b:a = b - 1, so a² = (b - 1)²c = b + 1, so c² = (b + 1)²Plugging these into the equation:(b - 1)² = (b + 1)² + b² - 2 * (b + 1) * b * (3/5)Let me expand each term step by step.First, expand (b - 1)²:= b² - 2b + 1Next, expand (b + 1)²:= b² + 2b + 1So, substituting back into the equation:b² - 2b + 1 = (b² + 2b + 1) + b² - 2*(b + 1)*b*(3/5)Simplify the right-hand side (RHS):First, combine the terms:= (b² + 2b + 1) + b²= 2b² + 2b + 1Now, subtract the term 2*(b + 1)*b*(3/5):= 2b² + 2b + 1 - (6/5)*(b² + b)Let me compute (6/5)*(b² + b):= (6/5)b² + (6/5)bSo, the RHS becomes:2b² + 2b + 1 - (6/5)b² - (6/5)bCombine like terms:2b² - (6/5)b² = (10/5 - 6/5)b² = (4/5)b²2b - (6/5)b = (10/5 - 6/5)b = (4/5)bSo, RHS simplifies to:(4/5)b² + (4/5)b + 1Therefore, our equation now is:Left-hand side (LHS): b² - 2b + 1Right-hand side (RHS): (4/5)b² + (4/5)b + 1So, set LHS = RHS:b² - 2b + 1 = (4/5)b² + (4/5)b + 1Let me subtract RHS from both sides to bring all terms to the left:b² - 2b + 1 - (4/5)b² - (4/5)b - 1 = 0Simplify term by term:b² - (4/5)b² = (5/5 - 4/5)b² = (1/5)b²-2b - (4/5)b = (-10/5 - 4/5)b = (-14/5)b1 - 1 = 0So, the equation becomes:(1/5)b² - (14/5)b = 0Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:b² - 14b = 0Factor out b:b(b - 14) = 0So, solutions are b = 0 or b = 14But since b is the length of side AC, it can't be zero. So, b = 14.Now, let's find the other sides:From earlier, a = b - 1 = 14 - 1 = 13c = b + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15So, sides are:- BC = a = 13- AC = b = 14- AB = c = 15Therefore, the perimeter is a + b + c = 13 + 14 + 15 = 42Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the Law of Cosines:a² = c² + b² - 2bc cos(A)We had a = 13, b =14, c=15, cos(A)=3/5.Compute a²: 13² = 169Compute c² + b²: 15² +14²=225 +196=421Compute 2bc cos(A): 2*15*14*(3/5)= 2*15*14*(3/5)Simplify: 2*15=30; 30*14=420; 420*(3/5)=252So, c² + b² - 2bc cos(A) = 421 - 252 = 169Which equals a²=169. So, that checks out.Therefore, the sides are 13,14,15, and the perimeter is 42.**Final Answer**The perimeter of triangle ( triangle ABC ) is boxed{42}."},{"question":"Let ( x ) and ( y ) both be positive numbers. Then the minimum value of ( M = frac{4x}{x + 3y} + frac{3y}{x} ) is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of ( M = frac{4x}{x + 3y} + frac{3y}{x} ) where both ( x ) and ( y ) are positive numbers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with expressions that have fractions and variables in both the numerator and denominator, sometimes substitution or using inequalities like AM-GM can be helpful. Let me see if I can manipulate this expression or maybe find a substitution that simplifies it.Looking at ( M ), it's composed of two terms: ( frac{4x}{x + 3y} ) and ( frac{3y}{x} ). Both terms have ( x ) and ( y ) in them, so maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other or find a relationship between them.Let me try substitution. Suppose I let ( t = frac{y}{x} ). Since both ( x ) and ( y ) are positive, ( t ) will also be positive. Then, ( y = tx ). Let me substitute this into ( M ):( M = frac{4x}{x + 3(tx)} + frac{3(tx)}{x} )Simplify the denominators and numerators:First term: ( frac{4x}{x + 3tx} = frac{4x}{x(1 + 3t)} = frac{4}{1 + 3t} )Second term: ( frac{3tx}{x} = 3t )So, ( M = frac{4}{1 + 3t} + 3t ). Now, ( M ) is expressed in terms of a single variable ( t ), which is positive. That should make it easier to find the minimum.Now, I need to find the minimum of ( M(t) = frac{4}{1 + 3t} + 3t ) for ( t > 0 ). Hmm, this seems like a calculus problem where I can take the derivative and set it to zero to find critical points.Let me compute the derivative of ( M(t) ) with respect to ( t ):( M'(t) = frac{d}{dt} left( frac{4}{1 + 3t} right) + frac{d}{dt}(3t) )First term derivative: ( frac{d}{dt} left( frac{4}{1 + 3t} right) = 4 cdot frac{d}{dt} left( (1 + 3t)^{-1} right) = 4 cdot (-1)(1 + 3t)^{-2} cdot 3 = -frac{12}{(1 + 3t)^2} )Second term derivative: ( frac{d}{dt}(3t) = 3 )So, putting it together:( M'(t) = -frac{12}{(1 + 3t)^2} + 3 )To find critical points, set ( M'(t) = 0 ):( -frac{12}{(1 + 3t)^2} + 3 = 0 )Let me solve for ( t ):( 3 = frac{12}{(1 + 3t)^2} )Multiply both sides by ( (1 + 3t)^2 ):( 3(1 + 3t)^2 = 12 )Divide both sides by 3:( (1 + 3t)^2 = 4 )Take square roots:( 1 + 3t = 2 ) or ( 1 + 3t = -2 )But since ( t > 0 ), ( 1 + 3t ) must be positive, so we discard the negative solution:( 1 + 3t = 2 )Subtract 1:( 3t = 1 )Divide by 3:( t = frac{1}{3} )So, the critical point is at ( t = frac{1}{3} ). Now, I need to check if this is a minimum. Since ( M(t) ) is defined for ( t > 0 ), and as ( t ) approaches 0, ( M(t) ) approaches ( frac{4}{1} + 0 = 4 ), and as ( t ) approaches infinity, ( M(t) ) approaches ( 0 + infty = infty ). Therefore, the function has a minimum somewhere in between, and since we found only one critical point, it must be the minimum.Let me compute ( M ) at ( t = frac{1}{3} ):( Mleft( frac{1}{3} right) = frac{4}{1 + 3 cdot frac{1}{3}} + 3 cdot frac{1}{3} )Simplify the denominator:( 1 + 3 cdot frac{1}{3} = 1 + 1 = 2 )So, first term: ( frac{4}{2} = 2 )Second term: ( 3 cdot frac{1}{3} = 1 )Thus, ( M = 2 + 1 = 3 )So, the minimum value of ( M ) is 3.Wait, just to make sure, let me verify using another method, maybe the AM-GM inequality, to see if I can get the same result.Looking back at the original expression:( M = frac{4x}{x + 3y} + frac{3y}{x} )Let me denote ( a = frac{4x}{x + 3y} ) and ( b = frac{3y}{x} ). Then, ( M = a + b ).I want to apply AM-GM on ( a ) and ( b ), but AM-GM requires that the terms are positive, which they are since ( x ) and ( y ) are positive.The AM-GM inequality states that ( frac{a + b}{2} geq sqrt{ab} ), so ( a + b geq 2sqrt{ab} ). Let me compute ( ab ):( ab = frac{4x}{x + 3y} cdot frac{3y}{x} = frac{12xy}{x(x + 3y)} = frac{12y}{x + 3y} )Hmm, so ( ab = frac{12y}{x + 3y} ). Let me see if I can express this in terms of another variable or find a relationship.Wait, from the substitution earlier, ( t = frac{y}{x} ), so ( y = tx ). Then, ( ab = frac{12tx}{x + 3tx} = frac{12t}{1 + 3t} ). So, ( ab = frac{12t}{1 + 3t} ).But I don't see an immediate way to relate this to something that can give me a constant bound. Maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, let me consider the expression ( frac{4x}{x + 3y} ). Let me write it as ( frac{4}{1 + 3frac{y}{x}} = frac{4}{1 + 3t} ), which is what I had earlier. Then, ( M = frac{4}{1 + 3t} + 3t ).Alternatively, maybe I can write ( M ) as ( frac{4}{1 + 3t} + 3t ) and try to apply AM-GM on the two terms. Let me see:Let me denote ( u = 1 + 3t ). Then, ( u > 1 ) since ( t > 0 ). Then, ( M = frac{4}{u} + 3t ). But ( t = frac{u - 1}{3} ), so substituting:( M = frac{4}{u} + 3 cdot frac{u - 1}{3} = frac{4}{u} + (u - 1) = u + frac{4}{u} - 1 )So, ( M = u + frac{4}{u} - 1 ). Now, this looks more manageable for AM-GM.Applying AM-GM on ( u ) and ( frac{4}{u} ):( frac{u + frac{4}{u}}{2} geq sqrt{u cdot frac{4}{u}} = sqrt{4} = 2 )Multiply both sides by 2:( u + frac{4}{u} geq 4 )Therefore, ( M = u + frac{4}{u} - 1 geq 4 - 1 = 3 )So, the minimum value of ( M ) is 3, achieved when ( u = frac{4}{u} ), which implies ( u^2 = 4 ), so ( u = 2 ) (since ( u > 1 )). Then, ( u = 2 ) gives ( 1 + 3t = 2 ), so ( t = frac{1}{3} ), which matches the earlier result.Therefore, both calculus and AM-GM methods give the same minimum value of 3.Just to recap, by substituting ( t = frac{y}{x} ), we transformed the original expression into a function of a single variable, found the critical point using calculus, and confirmed the result using the AM-GM inequality. Both approaches led us to the conclusion that the minimum value of ( M ) is 3.I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods corroborate each other. So, I'm confident that 3 is indeed the minimum value.**Final Answer**The minimum value of ( M ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Once, Carlson and Winnie the Pooh competed in the speed of eating honey and jam. Carlson, an expert in jam, eats a jar of jam in 2 minutes, while Winnie the Pooh takes a full 7 minutes to finish a jar of jam. Meanwhile, Winnie the Pooh can finish a pot of honey in 3 minutes, but Carlson requires 5 minutes to do the same. In total, they had 10 jars of jam and 10 pots of honey. For how many minutes did they eat everything, given that they started and finished eating at the same time? (Each eats a pot of honey or a jar of jam completely.)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Carlson and Winnie the Pooh are competing to eat honey and jam. They have 10 jars of jam and 10 pots of honey. I need to figure out how long it took them to eat everything, given that they started and finished at the same time. Each of them eats a pot of honey or a jar of jam completely, so they can't stop halfway through.First, let me list out the information given:- Carlson eats a jar of jam in 2 minutes.- Winnie eats a jar of jam in 7 minutes.- Winnie eats a pot of honey in 3 minutes.- Carlson eats a pot of honey in 5 minutes.They have 10 jars of jam and 10 pots of honey. So, in total, they need to eat 10 jars and 10 pots.Since they start and finish at the same time, the total time they spend eating must be the same for both of them. So, I need to figure out how they can split the eating of the jars and pots such that the time each spends is equal.Let me denote:- Let ( x ) be the number of jars of jam that Carlson eats.- Then, Winnie will eat ( 10 - x ) jars of jam because there are 10 jars in total.Similarly,- Let ( y ) be the number of pots of honey that Carlson eats.- Then, Winnie will eat ( 10 - y ) pots of honey because there are 10 pots in total.Now, the time Carlson spends eating is the time he takes to eat the jars plus the time he takes to eat the pots. Similarly, the time Winnie spends eating is the time she takes to eat the jars plus the time she takes to eat the pots.So, for Carlson:Time = (Number of jars he eats * time per jar) + (Number of pots he eats * time per pot)Time = ( x * 2 + y * 5 )For Winnie:Time = (Number of jars she eats * time per jar) + (Number of pots she eats * time per pot)Time = ( (10 - x) * 7 + (10 - y) * 3 )Since they finish at the same time, these two times must be equal. So, we can set up the equation:( 2x + 5y = 7(10 - x) + 3(10 - y) )Let me expand the right side:( 2x + 5y = 70 - 7x + 30 - 3y )Combine like terms on the right:( 2x + 5y = 100 - 7x - 3y )Now, let's bring all terms to the left side:( 2x + 5y + 7x + 3y - 100 = 0 )Combine like terms:( 9x + 8y - 100 = 0 )So, the equation simplifies to:( 9x + 8y = 100 )Now, I need to find integer solutions for ( x ) and ( y ) such that both ( x ) and ( y ) are between 0 and 10, inclusive, because they can't eat more than 10 jars or pots.So, let's solve for ( y ) in terms of ( x ):( 8y = 100 - 9x )( y = frac{100 - 9x}{8} )Since ( y ) must be an integer, ( 100 - 9x ) must be divisible by 8.So, ( 100 - 9x equiv 0 mod 8 )Let me compute 100 mod 8:100 divided by 8 is 12 with a remainder of 4, so 100 ≡ 4 mod 8.Similarly, 9x mod 8: since 9 ≡ 1 mod 8, so 9x ≡ x mod 8.Therefore, the equation becomes:4 - x ≡ 0 mod 8Which implies:x ≡ 4 mod 8So, x can be 4 or 12, but since x must be ≤10, x can only be 4 or 12-8=4. Wait, 12 is more than 10, so only x=4.Wait, hold on, 4 mod 8 is 4, so x=4, 12, 20,... but since x is between 0 and 10, x=4 is the only solution.So, x=4.Then, plugging back into the equation:( y = frac{100 - 9*4}{8} = frac{100 - 36}{8} = frac{64}{8} = 8 )So, y=8.Therefore, Carlson eats 4 jars of jam and 8 pots of honey.Winnie eats the remaining jars and pots:Jars: 10 - 4 = 6 jarsPots: 10 - 8 = 2 potsNow, let's compute the time each spends.For Carlson:Time = 4 jars * 2 minutes + 8 pots * 5 minutes = 8 + 40 = 48 minutesFor Winnie:Time = 6 jars * 7 minutes + 2 pots * 3 minutes = 42 + 6 = 48 minutesPerfect, both take 48 minutes. So, the total time is 48 minutes.Wait, but let me double-check if there are other possible solutions. Because sometimes modular equations can have multiple solutions within the range.Earlier, I found x ≡4 mod8, so x=4,12,20,... but since x can't exceed 10, x=4 is the only solution.But just to be thorough, let's check if x=4+8=12 is possible, but 12>10, so no.Similarly, x=4-8=-4, which is negative, so invalid.So, x=4 is the only solution.Therefore, the total time is 48 minutes.**Final Answer**They finished eating everything in boxed{48} minutes."},{"question":"In an admission exam with 1000 participants and an average score of 55 points, 200 people were admitted.

First, let's note down the given information:- Total participants: 1000- Average score of all participants: 55 points- Number of admitted: 200- Number of non-admitted: 1000 - 200 = 800- The average score of admitted group differs from non-admitted group by 60 points- Cutoff score is 4 points less than the average score of admitted groupSo, let's denote:- Let ( A ) be the average score of the admitted group- Let ( B ) be the average score of the non-admitted group- Let ( C ) be the cutoff scoreFrom the problem statement, we know:1. ( A - B = 60 ) or ( B - A = 60 ). Hmm, but since the admitted group is likely to have a higher average score, I think it's ( A - B = 60 ). Let me check that assumption later.2. The cutoff score ( C = A - 4 )Also, the total score of all participants can be calculated as the sum of the total scores of admitted and non-admitted groups.Total score = (Number admitted * Average admitted) + (Number non-admitted * Average non-admitted)Which translates to:( 1000 * 55 = 200 * A + 800 * B )So, 55,000 = 200A + 800BLet me write that equation:( 200A + 800B = 55,000 )We can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 200:( A + 4B = 275 )  [Equation 1]We also have the difference in averages:( A - B = 60 )  [Equation 2]So now, we have two equations:1. ( A + 4B = 275 )2. ( A - B = 60 )We can solve these two equations to find A and B.Let me subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:( (A + 4B) - (A - B) = 275 - 60 )Simplify:( A + 4B - A + B = 215 )Which becomes:( 5B = 215 )So, ( B = 215 / 5 = 43 )Now, plug B back into Equation 2:( A - 43 = 60 )So, ( A = 60 + 43 = 103 )Wait, that seems high. An average score of 103 for the admitted group? But the overall average is 55, and the non-admitted group has an average of 43. Let me check if that makes sense.Total score of admitted: 200 * 103 = 20,600Total score of non-admitted: 800 * 43 = 34,400Total score combined: 20,600 + 34,400 = 55,000, which matches the total score (1000 * 55). So, the numbers check out.But wait, an average of 103 seems really high. Is that possible? Maybe the scoring system allows for high scores. Let's proceed.Now, the cutoff score is 4 points less than the average of the admitted group. So,( C = A - 4 = 103 - 4 = 99 )So, the cutoff score is 99 points.But let me think again. If the average of the admitted group is 103, and the cutoff is 99, that means all admitted students scored at least 99, but their average is 103. That seems plausible because some could have scored higher than 99, pulling the average up.Wait, but if the cutoff is 99, then the minimum score to get admitted is 99. So, all admitted students have scores >= 99, and their average is 103. That makes sense.But just to make sure, let me verify the equations again.Total score:Admitted: 200 * 103 = 20,600Non-admitted: 800 * 43 = 34,400Total: 20,600 + 34,400 = 55,000, which is correct.Difference in averages: 103 - 43 = 60, which is correct.Cutoff score: 103 - 4 = 99So, all the numbers add up.But just to be thorough, let me consider the other possibility where ( B - A = 60 ). Maybe the non-admitted group has a higher average? That would mean the admitted group has a lower average, which doesn't make sense because usually, admitted students have higher scores. But let's check.If ( B - A = 60 ), then:Equation 2 becomes ( B = A + 60 )Plug into Equation 1:( A + 4(A + 60) = 275 )Simplify:( A + 4A + 240 = 275 )( 5A + 240 = 275 )( 5A = 35 )( A = 7 )Then, ( B = 7 + 60 = 67 )But then, the average of the admitted group is 7, which is way below the overall average of 55. That doesn't make sense because the non-admitted group would have a higher average, which would mean the admitted group is actually the lower-performing group, which contradicts the usual admission process. So, this scenario is invalid.Therefore, our initial assumption that ( A - B = 60 ) is correct.Hence, the cutoff score is 99.**Final Answer**The cutoff score is boxed{99} points."},{"question":"There are 8 boys and 5 girls. Choose 6 people from them.(1) How many different ways are there to make the selection?(2) How many different ways are there if there are exactly 3 girls?(3) How many different ways are there if there are at most 3 girls?(4) How many different ways are there if there are both boys and girls?","answer":"Alright, so I've got these four combinatorics problems to solve. Let me take them one by one and think through each step carefully. I remember that combinatorics often involves combinations and permutations, so I should probably use those concepts here.**Problem (1): How many different ways are there to make the selection?**Okay, so we have a total of 8 boys and 5 girls, making it 13 people in total. We need to choose 6 people from them. Since the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the number of boys or girls, it's just a straightforward combination problem.The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.So, plugging in the numbers, we have C(13, 6). Let me compute that.First, calculate 13! / (6! * 7!). But I don't need to compute the entire factorials; I can simplify it.13! / (6! * 7!) = (13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) / (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.Numerator: 13 × 12 = 156; 156 × 11 = 1716; 1716 × 10 = 17160; 17160 × 9 = 154440; 154440 × 8 = 1,235,520.Denominator: 6 × 5 = 30; 30 × 4 = 120; 120 × 3 = 360; 360 × 2 = 720; 720 × 1 = 720.So, 1,235,520 / 720. Let me divide that.Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 123,552 / 72.Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 15,444 / 9.15,444 divided by 9: 9 × 1,716 = 15,444. So, the result is 1,716.Wait, let me double-check that division because 1,235,520 divided by 720.Alternatively, 1,235,520 ÷ 720: 720 × 1,700 = 1,224,000. Subtract that from 1,235,520: 11,520 left. 720 × 16 = 11,520. So, total is 1,700 + 16 = 1,716. Yeah, that's correct.So, the number of ways is 1,716.**Problem (2): How many different ways are there if there are exactly 3 girls?**Alright, so now we need exactly 3 girls and the remaining 3 must be boys. Since there are 5 girls and 8 boys, we can compute the number of ways to choose 3 girls from 5 and 3 boys from 8, then multiply those two numbers together.So, it's C(5, 3) * C(8, 3).First, compute C(5, 3). That's 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5 × 4 × 3!) / (3! × 2 × 1) = (20) / 2 = 10.Next, compute C(8, 3). That's 8! / (3! * 5!) = (8 × 7 × 6) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 336 / 6 = 56.Multiply these two results: 10 * 56 = 560.So, there are 560 ways to choose exactly 3 girls and 3 boys.**Problem (3): How many different ways are there if there are at most 3 girls?**Hmm, \\"at most 3 girls\\" means we can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 girls in the selection of 6 people. So, we need to compute the number of ways for each case and then sum them up.So, the total number of ways is C(5, 0)*C(8,6) + C(5,1)*C(8,5) + C(5,2)*C(8,4) + C(5,3)*C(8,3).Let me compute each term step by step.First term: C(5,0)*C(8,6). C(5,0) is 1, since there's only one way to choose nothing. C(8,6) is the same as C(8,2) because C(n, k) = C(n, n - k). So, C(8,2) is (8 × 7)/2 = 28. So, first term is 1 * 28 = 28.Second term: C(5,1)*C(8,5). C(5,1) is 5. C(8,5) is the same as C(8,3) which we computed earlier as 56. So, 5 * 56 = 280.Third term: C(5,2)*C(8,4). C(5,2) is (5 × 4)/2 = 10. C(8,4) is 70. Wait, let me compute that. 8! / (4! * 4!) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 1680 / 24 = 70. So, 10 * 70 = 700.Fourth term: C(5,3)*C(8,3). We already computed these earlier: C(5,3) is 10 and C(8,3) is 56, so 10 * 56 = 560.Now, sum all these up: 28 + 280 + 700 + 560.28 + 280 = 308; 308 + 700 = 1,008; 1,008 + 560 = 1,568.So, the total number of ways is 1,568.Wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.First term: 28, second: 280, third: 700, fourth: 560.28 + 280 is 308. 308 + 700 is 1,008. 1,008 + 560 is indeed 1,568. Okay, that seems correct.**Problem (4): How many different ways are there if there are both boys and girls?**Alright, so we need to choose 6 people, but there must be at least one boy and at least one girl. So, we can't have all boys or all girls.First, compute the total number of ways without any restrictions, which we already found in problem (1) as 1,716.Then, subtract the number of ways where all are boys and the number of ways where all are girls.Compute the number of all-boy selections: C(8,6). C(8,6) is the same as C(8,2) which is 28, as computed earlier.Compute the number of all-girl selections: C(5,6). Wait, hold on. There are only 5 girls, so choosing 6 girls is impossible. So, C(5,6) is 0.Therefore, the number of ways with both boys and girls is total ways minus all boys minus all girls, which is 1,716 - 28 - 0 = 1,688.So, the answer is 1,688.Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.Total ways: 1,716.All boys: C(8,6) = 28.All girls: C(5,6) = 0.Thus, both boys and girls: 1,716 - 28 = 1,688. Yep, that seems right.**Summary of Answers:**1. 1,716 ways.2. 560 ways.3. 1,568 ways.4. 1,688 ways.I think that's all. I double-checked each step, so I feel confident about these answers.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{1716}(2) boxed{560}(3) boxed{1568}(4) boxed{1688}"},{"question":"Write a three-digit number after 1220 to form a seven-digit number. If this seven-digit number is a multiple of 2014, then what is this three-digit number?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to write a three-digit number after 1220 to form a seven-digit number. This seven-digit number has to be a multiple of 2014. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, let me understand the structure of the seven-digit number. If I write a three-digit number after 1220, that means the seven-digit number will be 1220 followed by three more digits. So, it's like 1220ABC, where A, B, and C are digits from 0 to 9. So, the number is 1220ABC, which is a seven-digit number.Now, this number needs to be a multiple of 2014. So, mathematically, we can write this as:1220ABC = 2014 × k, where k is some integer.Our goal is to find the three-digit number ABC such that this equation holds true.Let me think about how to approach this. Since 1220ABC is a seven-digit number, it's equal to 1220000 + ABC. So, 1220000 + ABC must be divisible by 2014. Therefore, ABC must be equal to (2014 × k) - 1220000.But since ABC is a three-digit number, it must be between 0 and 999. So, we have:0 ≤ (2014 × k) - 1220000 ≤ 999Let me solve for k here. Let's rearrange the inequality:1220000 ≤ 2014 × k ≤ 1220999So, k must satisfy:1220000 / 2014 ≤ k ≤ 1220999 / 2014Let me compute these values.First, 1220000 divided by 2014. Let me calculate that.2014 × 600 = 1,208,400Subtracting that from 1,220,000: 1,220,000 - 1,208,400 = 11,600So, 11,600 / 2014 ≈ 5.76So, 600 + 5.76 ≈ 605.76Therefore, k must be at least 606 because 605.76 is approximately, so next integer is 606.Similarly, the upper bound is 1,220,999 / 2014.Let me compute 2014 × 606.2014 × 600 = 1,208,4002014 × 6 = 12,084So, 1,208,400 + 12,084 = 1,220,484So, 2014 × 606 = 1,220,484Subtracting that from 1,220,999: 1,220,999 - 1,220,484 = 515So, 515 / 2014 ≈ 0.255Therefore, the upper bound is approximately 606.255, so k must be less than or equal to 606.Wait, that seems conflicting because the lower bound was approximately 605.76, so k must be 606.Wait, let me double-check.Wait, 1220000 / 2014 is approximately 605.76, so k must be at least 606. And 1220999 / 2014 is approximately 606.255, so k must be less than or equal to 606.Therefore, k must be exactly 606.Therefore, 2014 × 606 = 1,220,484So, 1220ABC = 1,220,484Therefore, ABC = 484Wait, so the three-digit number is 484.But let me verify.1220484 divided by 2014 should give us 606.Let me compute 2014 × 606.2014 × 600 = 1,208,4002014 × 6 = 12,084Adding them together: 1,208,400 + 12,084 = 1,220,484Yes, that's correct.So, 1220484 is indeed a multiple of 2014, specifically 2014 × 606.Therefore, the three-digit number is 484.Wait, but let me make sure that 484 is a three-digit number. Yes, it is. 484 is between 100 and 999, so that's valid.Is there any other possible k? Let me think.If k were 605, then 2014 × 605 = ?2014 × 600 = 1,208,4002014 × 5 = 10,070So, 1,208,400 + 10,070 = 1,218,470Then, 1,218,470 is less than 1,220,000, so ABC would be negative, which is not possible.Similarly, if k were 607, 2014 × 607 = ?2014 × 600 = 1,208,4002014 × 7 = 14,098So, 1,208,400 + 14,098 = 1,222,498Which is greater than 1,220,999, so that's too big.Therefore, k must be exactly 606, giving ABC as 484.Hence, the three-digit number is 484.**Final Answer**The three-digit number is boxed{484}."},{"question":"Given the sets A={xmid x^{2}+2x-8 < 0} and B={xmid |x-1| < 1}, find the number of integer elements in the set Acup B.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of integer elements in the set ( A cup B ). The sets are defined as ( A = {x mid x^2 + 2x - 8 < 0} ) and ( B = {x mid |x - 1| < 1} ). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, I think I should figure out what each set ( A ) and ( B ) actually contains. Starting with set ( A ), it's defined by the inequality ( x^2 + 2x - 8 < 0 ). I remember that quadratic inequalities can be solved by finding the roots of the quadratic equation and then determining the intervals where the quadratic expression is negative.So, let me solve the equation ( x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0 ). To find the roots, I can use the quadratic formula: ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ). Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = -8 ). Plugging these into the formula:( x = frac{-2 pm sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(1)(-8)}}{2(1)} )( x = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 32}}{2} )( x = frac{-2 pm sqrt{36}}{2} )( x = frac{-2 pm 6}{2} )So, the roots are:( x = frac{-2 + 6}{2} = frac{4}{2} = 2 )( x = frac{-2 - 6}{2} = frac{-8}{2} = -4 )Okay, so the roots are ( x = -4 ) and ( x = 2 ). Since the quadratic opens upwards (because the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive), the quadratic expression ( x^2 + 2x - 8 ) will be negative between the roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality ( x^2 + 2x - 8 < 0 ) is ( -4 < x < 2 ).So, set ( A ) is the interval ( (-4, 2) ).Now, moving on to set ( B ), which is defined by ( |x - 1| < 1 ). I know that absolute value inequalities can be rewritten without the absolute value by considering the distance from a point. Specifically, ( |x - 1| < 1 ) means that ( x ) is within 1 unit of 1 on the number line.So, this inequality can be rewritten as:( -1 < x - 1 < 1 )Adding 1 to all parts of the inequality:( -1 + 1 < x < 1 + 1 )( 0 < x < 2 )Therefore, set ( B ) is the interval ( (0, 2) ).Now, I need to find the union of sets ( A ) and ( B ), which is ( A cup B ). The union of two intervals is the set of all real numbers that are in either interval. So, let me visualize this.Set ( A ) is ( (-4, 2) ) and set ( B ) is ( (0, 2) ). Since ( B ) is entirely contained within ( A ) (because ( 0 > -4 ) and ( 2 < 2 )), the union ( A cup B ) will just be ( (-4, 2) ). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.No, actually, ( B ) is ( (0, 2) ), which is entirely within ( A )'s upper half, but ( A ) extends from ( -4 ) to ( 2 ), while ( B ) is from ( 0 ) to ( 2 ). So, the union would be from the smallest start point to the largest endpoint. Since ( A ) starts at ( -4 ) and ( B ) starts at ( 0 ), the union starts at ( -4 ). The endpoints both end at ( 2 ). So, yes, ( A cup B ) is indeed ( (-4, 2) ).Wait, hold on, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me think again. If ( A ) is ( (-4, 2) ) and ( B ) is ( (0, 2) ), then combining them, the union is all the numbers from ( -4 ) to ( 2 ), because ( B ) doesn't add any new numbers beyond what ( A ) already has. So, yes, ( A cup B = (-4, 2) ).But just to be thorough, let me consider the intervals:- ( A ) covers from ( -4 ) to ( 2 ).- ( B ) covers from ( 0 ) to ( 2 ).So, when taking the union, the combined interval is from the leftmost point of ( A ) to the rightmost point of ( A ) or ( B ). Since both end at ( 2 ), the union is ( (-4, 2) ).Okay, so ( A cup B ) is ( (-4, 2) ). Now, the question is asking for the number of integer elements in this set. So, I need to list all integers ( x ) such that ( x ) is in ( (-4, 2) ).Let me recall that ( (-4, 2) ) is an open interval, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints ( -4 ) and ( 2 ). So, the integers within this interval are the integers greater than ( -4 ) and less than ( 2 ).Let me list them:Starting just above ( -4 ), the next integer is ( -3 ). Then ( -2 ), ( -1 ), ( 0 ), ( 1 ). Then, just below ( 2 ), the integer is ( 1 ). Wait, so let me list them step by step:- The smallest integer greater than ( -4 ) is ( -3 ).- Then ( -2 ).- Then ( -1 ).- Then ( 0 ).- Then ( 1 ).- The next integer would be ( 2 ), but since the interval is open at ( 2 ), ( 2 ) is not included.So, the integers in ( (-4, 2) ) are ( -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 ). That's five integers.Wait, let me count them again:1. ( -3 )2. ( -2 )3. ( -1 )4. ( 0 )5. ( 1 )Yes, that's five integers.But hold on, let me make sure I haven't missed any. Starting from ( -4 ), the next integer is ( -3 ), which is included. Then ( -2 ), ( -1 ), ( 0 ), ( 1 ). After ( 1 ), the next integer is ( 2 ), which is excluded. So, yes, five integers.Therefore, the number of integer elements in ( A cup B ) is 5.Wait, just to double-check, is there any chance that ( A cup B ) is actually a different interval? Let me think again.Set ( A ) is ( (-4, 2) ), and set ( B ) is ( (0, 2) ). So, when taking the union, it's all the numbers that are in either set. Since ( A ) already includes everything from ( -4 ) to ( 2 ), and ( B ) is a subset of ( A ), the union is just ( A ). So, yes, ( A cup B = (-4, 2) ).Therefore, the integer elements are ( -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 ), which is five integers. So, the answer is 5.Wait, hold on, another thought: is ( 0 ) included? Since ( 0 ) is between ( -4 ) and ( 2 ), yes, it is. Similarly, ( 1 ) is included. So, yes, all those integers are within the interval.I think that's solid. So, the number of integer elements is 5.**Final Answer**The number of integer elements in the set ( A cup B ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"A test field used for experimenting with a new variety of rice has an area of 40 mu.

Calculate the total amount of rice produced by this test field in kilograms.","answer":"First, I need to understand the given information. The test field is 40 mu in total. A portion of it is planted with the new rice variety, and the remaining portion is planted with the old variety. The old variety yields 500 kilograms per mu.For the new variety, 75% of the planted area was unsuccessful, yielding only 400 kilograms per mu, while 25% was successful, yielding 800 kilograms per mu.

Hmm, extreme value... I think that refers to either a maximum or a minimum point on the graph of the function. Since it's asking for the extreme value, I guess I need to find where the function reaches its highest or lowest point.First, I remember that to find extreme values, we can use calculus, specifically by finding the critical points. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is zero or undefined. So, I should start by finding the derivative of f(x).Let me write down the function again: f(x) = x - ln x. To find the derivative, f'(x), I'll differentiate each term separately. The derivative of x with respect to x is 1, and the derivative of ln x is 1/x. So, putting that together, f'(x) = 1 - (1/x).Now, I need to find where this derivative is zero or undefined. Let's first see where it's undefined. The derivative f'(x) = 1 - 1/x is undefined when x = 0 because dividing by zero isn't allowed. However, looking back at the original function f(x) = x - ln x, ln x is also undefined at x = 0. So, the domain of f(x) is x > 0. That means x = 0 isn't in the domain, so we don't need to consider it as a critical point.Next, let's find where f'(x) = 0. So, set 1 - 1/x equal to zero:1 - (1/x) = 0Let me solve for x. I'll add 1/x to both sides:1 = 1/xThen, take reciprocals on both sides:x = 1So, the critical point is at x = 1. Now, I need to determine whether this critical point is a maximum or a minimum. For that, I can use the second derivative test.First, let's find the second derivative f''(x). Starting from f'(x) = 1 - 1/x, differentiate again:The derivative of 1 is 0, and the derivative of -1/x is 1/x². So, f''(x) = 1/x².Now, evaluate f''(x) at the critical point x = 1:f''(1) = 1/(1)² = 1.Since f''(1) is positive (1 > 0), this means the function is concave up at x = 1, so the critical point is a local minimum.Therefore, the function f(x) has a local minimum at x = 1. Now, to find the extreme value, which is the y-value at this point, I need to compute f(1):f(1) = 1 - ln(1)I remember that ln(1) is 0 because e^0 = 1. So,f(1) = 1 - 0 = 1.So, the extreme value is 1, and it's a minimum.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check my steps.1. Found the first derivative: f'(x) = 1 - 1/x. That seems right.2. Set f'(x) = 0: 1 - 1/x = 0 leads to x = 1. Correct.3. Found the second derivative: f''(x) = 1/x². Yes, because the derivative of -1/x is 1/x².4. Evaluated f''(1): 1, which is positive, so it's a minimum. Makes sense.5. Calculated f(1): 1 - ln(1) = 1. Correct.So, all steps seem to check out. Therefore, the extreme value is indeed 1, and it's a minimum.Just to visualize, the function f(x) = x - ln x. As x approaches 0 from the right, ln x approaches negative infinity, so f(x) approaches positive infinity. As x approaches positive infinity, x grows much faster than ln x, so f(x) also approaches positive infinity. Therefore, the function must have a minimum somewhere in between, which we found at x = 1. So, that makes sense.I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The extreme value of the function is boxed{1}."},{"question":"On Arbor Day, students went to plant trees, planting 20 trees per row for a total of 18 rows.

Let me see... There are two parts. First, when a is 1, I need to find the product of z₁ and z₂. Second, if z₁ plus z₂ is a real number, I have to find the value of a. Hmm, okay, let's take it step by step.Starting with part (1). They give z₁ as 2 + ai, and when a is 1, that becomes 2 + i. And z₂ is 3 - 4i. So I need to multiply these two complex numbers together. I remember that when multiplying complex numbers, I can use the distributive property, like (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. So let me write that out.So, z₁z₂ = (2 + i)(3 - 4i). Let's distribute that. First, multiply 2 by 3, which is 6. Then, 2 times -4i is -8i. Next, i times 3 is 3i. And finally, i times -4i is -4i². So putting it all together, I have 6 - 8i + 3i - 4i².Wait, now I need to simplify this. I remember that i² is equal to -1, so -4i² is the same as -4*(-1) which is +4. So substituting that back in, the expression becomes 6 - 8i + 3i + 4.Now, let's combine like terms. The real parts are 6 and 4, which add up to 10. The imaginary parts are -8i and 3i, which combine to -5i. So altogether, z₁z₂ is 10 - 5i when a is 1. That seems straightforward.Moving on to part (2). Here, they say that z₁ + z₂ is a real number, and I need to find the value of a. Okay, so z₁ is 2 + ai, and z₂ is 3 - 4i. Let's add them together.Adding complex numbers is done by adding their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. So, the real parts are 2 and 3, which add up to 5. The imaginary parts are ai and -4i, which add up to (a - 4)i.So, z₁ + z₂ = 5 + (a - 4)i. Now, the problem states that this sum is a real number. Hmm, so for a complex number to be real, its imaginary part has to be zero. That means the coefficient of i must be zero.So, setting the imaginary part equal to zero: a - 4 = 0. Solving for a, we get a = 4. That makes sense because if a is 4, then the imaginary part becomes 4i - 4i, which cancels out, leaving just the real number 5.Wait, let me double-check that. If a is 4, then z₁ is 2 + 4i. Adding z₂, which is 3 - 4i, so 2 + 3 is 5, and 4i - 4i is 0i. So yes, the sum is 5, which is a real number. Perfect, that seems right.So, to recap: For part (1), when a is 1, the product z₁z₂ is 10 - 5i. For part (2), in order for z₁ + z₂ to be real, a must be 4.

Since the integers range from 1000 to 9999, inclusive, there are 9000 possible integers.Next, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the odd integers with all distinct digits. An odd integer must end with an odd digit, so the last digit can be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, giving 5 choices.For the first digit, it can't be 0 and must be different from the last digit. This leaves 8 choices (1-9 excluding the last digit).The second digit can be any digit except the first and last digits, providing 8 choices (0-9 excluding the first and last digits).Similarly, the third digit must be different from the first and second digits, leaving 7 choices.Multiplying these choices together: 5 (last digit) × 8 (first digit) × 8 (second digit) × 7 (third digit) = 2240 favorable integers.Finally, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible integers: 2240 / 9000.

To encourage orders from retailers, the factory decides to offer a discount: for any order exceeding 100 pieces, the wholesale price per garment is reduced by 0.02 yuan for each additional piece ordered. According to market research, retailers will not order more than 500 pieces at a time.(I) Let the order quantity be x pieces and the actual wholesale price be P yuan per piece. Write the expression for the function P=f(x).(II) How much profit does the factory make when a retailer orders 450 pieces of the garment? (Profit per garment = actual wholesale price - cost)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a clothing factory and their pricing strategy. It's divided into two parts, I and II. Let me try to figure out each part step by step.Starting with part (I): They want me to write the function P = f(x), where P is the actual wholesale price and x is the order quantity. The factory sets the wholesale price at 60 yuan per piece, but if the order exceeds 100 pieces, they offer a discount. For each additional piece beyond 100, the price is reduced by 0.02 yuan. Also, retailers won't order more than 500 pieces at a time.Hmm, so first, I need to model this pricing structure. Let's break it down.For orders of 100 pieces or less, the price remains at 60 yuan per piece. That seems straightforward. So, if x ≤ 100, then P = 60.But when x exceeds 100, the price starts to decrease. The discount is 0.02 yuan for each additional piece beyond 100. So, for each piece beyond 100, the price drops by 0.02. That means the total discount would be 0.02 multiplied by the number of pieces beyond 100.Let me express that mathematically. If x is the order quantity, then the number of pieces beyond 100 is (x - 100). So, the discount per piece would be 0.02*(x - 100). Therefore, the actual price P would be the original price minus this discount.So, P = 60 - 0.02*(x - 100). But wait, this is only when x > 100, right? Because for x ≤ 100, the price is fixed at 60.Also, the problem mentions that retailers won't order more than 500 pieces. So, the maximum x is 500. Therefore, x ranges from 0 to 500.Putting it all together, the function P = f(x) is a piecewise function:- When x ≤ 100, P = 60- When 100 < x ≤ 500, P = 60 - 0.02*(x - 100)Let me double-check this. If x is exactly 100, then P is 60. If x is 101, then P is 60 - 0.02*(1) = 59.98. That seems right. For x = 200, P would be 60 - 0.02*(100) = 60 - 2 = 58. That also makes sense. And for x = 500, P would be 60 - 0.02*(400) = 60 - 8 = 52. So, the price decreases by 0.02 yuan for each additional piece beyond 100, which is correct.So, I think that's part (I) done. Now, moving on to part (II): Calculating the profit when a retailer orders 450 pieces.Profit per garment is given as actual wholesale price minus cost. The cost to manufacture each garment is 40 yuan. So, profit per garment is P - 40.First, I need to find the actual wholesale price P when x = 450. Since 450 is greater than 100, we use the second part of the piecewise function.So, P = 60 - 0.02*(450 - 100) = 60 - 0.02*(350) = 60 - 7 = 53 yuan per piece.Therefore, the profit per garment is 53 - 40 = 13 yuan.Now, total profit would be profit per garment multiplied by the number of garments ordered, which is 450.Total profit = 13 * 450.Let me calculate that. 13 * 400 = 5200, and 13 * 50 = 650. So, 5200 + 650 = 5850 yuan.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify the calculations again.First, P when x=450: 60 - 0.02*(450 - 100) = 60 - 0.02*350 = 60 - 7 = 53. Correct.Profit per garment: 53 - 40 = 13. Correct.Total profit: 13 * 450. Let me compute 450 * 10 = 4500, 450 * 3 = 1350. So, 4500 + 1350 = 5850. Yes, that's correct.So, the total profit is 5850 yuan.Just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to compute this. Maybe compute the revenue first and then subtract the cost.Revenue would be P * x = 53 * 450. Let's compute that.53 * 450: 50*450 = 22500, 3*450 = 1350, so total revenue is 22500 + 1350 = 23850 yuan.Total cost is 40 * 450 = 18000 yuan.Profit is revenue minus cost: 23850 - 18000 = 5850 yuan. Same result. So, that's consistent.Therefore, I'm confident that the profit is 5850 yuan.Wait, just to be thorough, let me check if the function P is correctly defined.At x=450, which is 350 more than 100, so the discount is 0.02*350=7. So, 60-7=53. Correct.Yes, that's correct.So, summarizing:(I) The function P = f(x) is:- 60, when x ≤ 100- 60 - 0.02*(x - 100), when 100 < x ≤ 500(II) The profit when ordering 450 pieces is 5850 yuan.I think that's all.**Final Answer**(I) The function is ( P = begin{cases} 60 & text{if } x leq 100,  60 - 0.02(x - 100) & text{if } 100 < x leq 500. end{cases} )(II) The profit is boxed{5850} yuan."},{"question":"Given that F_1 and F_2 are the foci of the ellipse C:frac{x^{2}}{8}+frac{y^{2}}{4}=1, find the number of points P on C such that PF_{1} perp PF_{2}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an ellipse, and I need to find the number of points P on the ellipse such that the lines from P to each of the foci, F₁ and F₂, are perpendicular to each other. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me recall what an ellipse is. An ellipse is a set of points where the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant. The standard equation of an ellipse is (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1, where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis. In this case, the equation is given as (x²/8) + (y²/4) = 1. So, comparing this to the standard form, a² = 8 and b² = 4. Therefore, a = 2√2 and b = 2.Now, the foci of an ellipse are located at a distance of c from the center along the major axis, where c² = a² - b². Let me compute c. So, c² = 8 - 4 = 4, which means c = 2. Since the major axis is along the x-axis (because a² is under x²), the foci are located at (±c, 0), which is (±2, 0). So, F₁ is (-2, 0) and F₂ is (2, 0).Alright, so we have the foci at (-2, 0) and (2, 0). Now, we need to find the number of points P on the ellipse such that PF₁ is perpendicular to PF₂. That is, the vectors from P to F₁ and from P to F₂ are perpendicular. Let me denote point P as (x, y) on the ellipse. Then, the vector PF₁ would be (x - (-2), y - 0) = (x + 2, y), and the vector PF₂ would be (x - 2, y - 0) = (x - 2, y). For these two vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero. So, the dot product of PF₁ and PF₂ is:(x + 2)(x - 2) + y * y = 0.Let me compute that:(x + 2)(x - 2) = x² - 4, and y * y = y². So, the equation becomes:x² - 4 + y² = 0.Simplify that:x² + y² = 4.Wait, so the set of points P where PF₁ is perpendicular to PF₂ lies on the circle centered at the origin with radius 2. Interesting. So, we need to find the points P that lie on both the ellipse (x²/8) + (y²/4) = 1 and the circle x² + y² = 4.So, essentially, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously:1. (x²)/8 + (y²)/4 = 12. x² + y² = 4Let me try to solve these equations. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other from the second equation and substitute into the first.From equation 2: x² + y² = 4, so y² = 4 - x².Substitute y² into equation 1:(x²)/8 + (4 - x²)/4 = 1Let me compute this step by step.First, write down the equation:(x²)/8 + (4 - x²)/4 = 1To combine these terms, let me find a common denominator, which would be 8.Multiply the second term by 2/2 to get:(x²)/8 + [2*(4 - x²)]/8 = 1Simplify the numerator:(x² + 8 - 2x²)/8 = 1Combine like terms:(-x² + 8)/8 = 1Multiply both sides by 8:-x² + 8 = 8Subtract 8 from both sides:-x² = 0Multiply both sides by -1:x² = 0So, x² = 0 implies x = 0.Then, from equation 2, y² = 4 - x² = 4 - 0 = 4, so y = ±2.So, the solutions are (0, 2) and (0, -2). So, are these the only points where PF₁ is perpendicular to PF₂?Wait, but that seems like only two points. But I feel like maybe there are more points. Let me think again.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my substitution or calculations.Let me double-check.Starting again:From equation 2: y² = 4 - x².Substitute into equation 1:(x²)/8 + (4 - x²)/4 = 1Compute each term:(x²)/8 is as is.(4 - x²)/4 can be written as 1 - (x²)/4.So, substituting:(x²)/8 + 1 - (x²)/4 = 1Combine like terms:(x²)/8 - (x²)/4 + 1 = 1Compute (x²)/8 - (x²)/4:Convert to eighths: (x²)/8 - 2x²/8 = (-x²)/8So, equation becomes:(-x²)/8 + 1 = 1Subtract 1 from both sides:(-x²)/8 = 0Multiply both sides by 8:-x² = 0 => x² = 0 => x = 0.So, same result. So, only x = 0, and y = ±2. So, only two points.But wait, intuitively, on an ellipse, if you have two foci, I might expect more points where the lines from P to each focus are perpendicular. Maybe four points? Hmm.Wait, let me think about the circle x² + y² = 4. The ellipse is (x²)/8 + (y²)/4 = 1. Let me see what the ellipse looks like.The ellipse has semi-major axis a = 2√2 ≈ 2.828, and semi-minor axis b = 2. So, it's longer along the x-axis. The circle has radius 2, so it's entirely inside the ellipse? Wait, no. Wait, the ellipse extends up to x = ±2√2 ≈ ±2.828, and y = ±2. The circle has radius 2, so it extends up to x = ±2 and y = ±2. So, the circle is entirely inside the ellipse? Wait, no, because at x = 2, the ellipse has y² = 4*(1 - (4)/8) = 4*(1 - 0.5) = 2, so y = ±√2 ≈ ±1.414. But the circle at x = 2 has y² = 4 - 4 = 0, so only the point (2, 0). Similarly, at y = 2, the ellipse has x² = 8*(1 - (4)/4) = 0, so x = 0. So, the circle intersects the ellipse at (0, ±2). So, only two points.Wait, so that seems correct. So, only two points where the circle and the ellipse intersect, which are (0, 2) and (0, -2). So, only two such points P.But wait, is that all? Let me think about the geometry.If I imagine the ellipse, it's longer along the x-axis, and the circle is centered at the origin with radius equal to the distance from the center to each focus. So, the circle is passing through the foci. Hmm, interesting. So, the circle is passing through F₁ and F₂.Wait, so the circle x² + y² = 4 has radius 2, which is the same as the distance from the center to each focus. So, the circle passes through both foci.So, in that case, the points where the circle intersects the ellipse would be points where P is such that PF₁ is perpendicular to PF₂.But in our case, the only intersection points are (0, 2) and (0, -2). So, that would mean only two such points.But wait, is that correct? Because I thought maybe there could be more points where the vectors are perpendicular.Wait, let me think about another approach.Alternatively, perhaps using parametric equations for the ellipse.The parametric equations for the ellipse (x²)/8 + (y²)/4 = 1 can be written as:x = 2√2 cosθy = 2 sinθWhere θ is the parameter varying from 0 to 2π.So, point P can be represented as (2√2 cosθ, 2 sinθ).Then, vectors PF₁ and PF₂ can be written as:PF₁ = (2√2 cosθ - (-2), 2 sinθ - 0) = (2√2 cosθ + 2, 2 sinθ)PF₂ = (2√2 cosθ - 2, 2 sinθ - 0) = (2√2 cosθ - 2, 2 sinθ)For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.So, compute the dot product:(2√2 cosθ + 2)(2√2 cosθ - 2) + (2 sinθ)(2 sinθ) = 0Let me compute each part.First, compute (2√2 cosθ + 2)(2√2 cosθ - 2):This is of the form (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², where a = 2√2 cosθ and b = 2.So, (2√2 cosθ)^2 - (2)^2 = (8 cos²θ) - 4.Then, the second part is (2 sinθ)(2 sinθ) = 4 sin²θ.So, putting it all together:8 cos²θ - 4 + 4 sin²θ = 0Simplify:8 cos²θ + 4 sin²θ - 4 = 0Factor out 4:4(2 cos²θ + sin²θ - 1) = 0Divide both sides by 4:2 cos²θ + sin²θ - 1 = 0Now, let me express this in terms of a single trigonometric function. Let me recall that sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ.So, substitute sin²θ:2 cos²θ + (1 - cos²θ) - 1 = 0Simplify:2 cos²θ + 1 - cos²θ - 1 = 0Combine like terms:(2 cos²θ - cos²θ) + (1 - 1) = 0Which simplifies to:cos²θ + 0 = 0So, cos²θ = 0Therefore, cosθ = 0Which implies θ = π/2 or 3π/2.So, θ = π/2: point P is (2√2 cos(π/2), 2 sin(π/2)) = (0, 2)θ = 3π/2: point P is (2√2 cos(3π/2), 2 sin(3π/2)) = (0, -2)So, again, only two points: (0, 2) and (0, -2). So, that seems consistent with my earlier result.Hmm, so that suggests that there are only two such points on the ellipse where PF₁ is perpendicular to PF₂.But wait, I initially thought maybe four points, but both methods give me two points. So, maybe two is the correct answer.But let me think again. Maybe I missed something.Wait, another way to think about this is that the condition PF₁ ⊥ PF₂ is equivalent to the point P lying on the circle with diameter F₁F₂. Wait, is that the case?Wait, no, actually, the set of points P such that angle F₁PF₂ is a right angle is the circle with diameter F₁F₂, but only the points outside the segment F₁F₂. Wait, but in our case, the circle x² + y² = 4 is exactly the circle with diameter F₁F₂, since F₁ and F₂ are at (-2, 0) and (2, 0), so the distance between them is 4, so the radius is 2, centered at the origin.But in our case, the ellipse is larger than the circle. So, the ellipse extends beyond the circle, but the circle is inside the ellipse except at the points (0, ±2). So, the only intersection points are (0, 2) and (0, -2), which are the top and bottom of the circle.Therefore, only two points.Wait, but in general, the circle with diameter F₁F₂ intersects the ellipse at four points, right? Or is that not the case here?Wait, let me think. If the ellipse were a circle, then the circle with diameter F₁F₂ would coincide with the ellipse, but in this case, the ellipse is not a circle. So, maybe the number of intersection points is limited.Wait, let me compute the intersection points again.We have the ellipse (x²)/8 + (y²)/4 = 1 and the circle x² + y² = 4.Let me solve these equations again.From the circle: x² + y² = 4.From the ellipse: (x²)/8 + (y²)/4 = 1.Multiply the ellipse equation by 8: x² + 2y² = 8.Now, subtract the circle equation from this:(x² + 2y²) - (x² + y²) = 8 - 4Simplify:x² + 2y² - x² - y² = 4Which is:y² = 4So, y = ±2.Substitute back into the circle equation: x² + (4) = 4 => x² = 0 => x = 0.Thus, the only solutions are (0, 2) and (0, -2). So, only two points.Therefore, the number of such points P is 2.Wait, but I thought maybe four points because of symmetry, but apparently, in this case, it's only two.Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the director circle of the ellipse. Wait, the director circle of an ellipse is the locus of points from which the ellipse is seen at a right angle, i.e., the points P such that the two tangents from P to the ellipse are perpendicular. The equation of the director circle is x² + y² = a² + b².In our case, a² = 8, b² = 4, so the director circle is x² + y² = 12. But in our problem, the circle is x² + y² = 4, which is different. So, that might not be directly applicable here.Wait, but in our problem, the condition is about the lines from P to the foci being perpendicular, not the tangents. So, perhaps it's a different circle.But in any case, the calculation shows that only two points satisfy both the ellipse equation and the circle equation x² + y² = 4, which are (0, 2) and (0, -2).Therefore, I think the answer is 2.But just to make sure, let me think about the geometry again.The ellipse is longer along the x-axis, and the circle is smaller, centered at the origin with radius 2. The ellipse's top and bottom points are at (0, ±2), which are exactly the points where the circle intersects the ellipse. So, those are the only points where both conditions are satisfied.So, yeah, I think it's two points.**Final Answer**The number of such points ( P ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday.

It's known that ( x ) has exactly three distinct prime divisors, one of which is 11. I need to find ( x ).Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. First, let's understand what the problem is asking. We have ( x ) defined as ( 6^n + 1 ), and ( n ) is an odd natural number. So, ( n ) can be 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. The number ( x ) has exactly three distinct prime factors, and one of them is 11. So, I need to find such an ( x ).Since ( x = 6^n + 1 ), let's compute ( x ) for small odd values of ( n ) and see if it satisfies the given conditions. Maybe I can find a pattern or figure out the possible ( n ) that works.Let me start with ( n = 1 ):( x = 6^1 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 ).

Dividing by small primes: 217 ÷ 7 = 31. So, 217 = 7 × 31. Both 7 and 31 are primes, so ( x = 217 ) has two prime divisors. Still, we need three, so ( n = 3 ) doesn't work either.Moving on to ( n = 5 ):( x = 6^5 + 1 = 7776 + 1 = 7777 ). Let's factorize 7777. I know that 7777 ÷ 7 = 1111, so 7777 = 7 × 1111. Now, 1111 is 101 × 11, right? Let me check: 11 × 101 = 1111. So, 7777 = 7 × 11 × 101. That's three distinct prime factors: 7, 11, and 101. Perfect! So, ( x = 7777 ) has exactly three distinct prime divisors, one of which is 11. Wait, so is that the answer? Let me just verify for ( n = 5 ). Yes, 6^5 is 7776, plus 1 is 7777. Factoring that gives 7 × 11 × 101, which are all primes. So, that seems to fit.But just to be thorough, let me check ( n = 7 ) as well, to make sure there isn't another possible ( x ).Calculating ( x = 6^7 + 1 ). 6^7 is 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6. Let me compute that step by step:- 6^1 = 6- 6^2 = 36- 6^3 = 216- 6^4 = 1296- 6^5 = 7776- 6^6 = 46656- 6^7 = 279936So, ( x = 279936 + 1 = 279937 ). Now, let's factorize 279937. Hmm, this might be a bit more challenging. Let me try dividing by small primes.First, check if it's even: 279937 is odd, so not divisible by 2.Sum of digits: 2 + 7 + 9 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 37, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 doesn't divide it.Check divisibility by 5: ends with 7, so no.Check 7: Let's do 279937 ÷ 7. 7 × 39991 = 279,937. Wait, 7 × 39991 is 279,937? Let me compute 7 × 40,000 = 280,000. So, 280,000 - 7 × 9 = 280,000 - 63 = 279,937. So, yes, 279937 = 7 × 39991.Now, check if 39991 is prime. Let's test divisibility by smaller primes. 39991 ÷ 11: 11 × 3635 = 39985, which is 6 less than 39991, so not divisible by 11. Next, 13: 13 × 3076 = 39988, which is 3 less, so not divisible by 13. 17: 17 × 2352 = 39984, which is 7 less, so no. 19: 19 × 2104 = 39976, which is 15 less, so no. 23: 23 × 1738 = 39974, which is 17 less, so no. 29: 29 × 1379 = 39991? Let me compute 29 × 1379.29 × 1000 = 29,00029 × 300 = 8,70029 × 79 = 2,291Adding up: 29,000 + 8,700 = 37,700 + 2,291 = 39,991. Yes! So, 29 × 1379 = 39,991. Therefore, 39991 = 29 × 1379.Now, check if 1379 is prime. Let's test divisibility: 1379 ÷ 7 = 197, which is exact? 7 × 197 = 1379. Let me check: 7 × 200 = 1400, minus 7 × 3 = 21, so 1400 - 21 = 1379. Yes, so 1379 = 7 × 197.So, putting it all together, 279937 = 7 × 29 × 7 × 197. Wait, that's 7^2 × 29 × 197. So, the prime factors are 7, 29, and 197. So, that's three distinct prime factors as well. But wait, 7 is repeated, so actually, the number of distinct prime factors is three: 7, 29, 197. So, 279937 has exactly three distinct prime factors. However, the problem states that one of the prime factors is 11. In this case, 279937 doesn't have 11 as a prime factor. So, that doesn't fit the condition.Therefore, ( n = 7 ) gives us a number with three distinct prime factors, but not including 11. So, it's not the answer we're looking for.Let me check ( n = 9 ) just to see if the pattern continues or if maybe another one pops up with 11 as a factor.Compute ( x = 6^9 + 1 ). 6^9 is 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6. Let me compute step by step:6^1 = 66^2 = 366^3 = 2166^4 = 12966^5 = 77766^6 = 466566^7 = 2799366^8 = 1,679,6166^9 = 10,077,696So, ( x = 10,077,696 + 1 = 10,077,697 ). Now, factorizing 10,077,697. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me see if I can find any small prime factors.First, check divisibility by 2: it's odd, so no.Sum of digits: 1+0+0+7+7+6+9+7 = 37, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 doesn't divide it.Ends with 7, so not divisible by 5.Check 7: Let's compute 10,077,697 ÷ 7. 7 × 1,439,671 = 10,077,697? Let me check: 7 × 1,400,000 = 9,800,000. Subtract that from 10,077,697: 10,077,697 - 9,800,000 = 277,697. Now, 7 × 39,671 = 277,697. So, yes, 7 × (1,400,000 + 39,671) = 7 × 1,439,671 = 10,077,697. So, 10,077,697 = 7 × 1,439,671.Now, check if 1,439,671 is prime. Let's test divisibility by smaller primes. 1,439,671 ÷ 11: 11 × 130,879 = 1,439,669, which is 2 less, so not divisible by 11. Next, 13: 13 × 110,743 = 1,439,659, which is 12 less, so no. 17: 17 × 84,686 = 1,439,662, which is 9 less, so no. 19: 19 × 75,771 = 1,439,649, which is 22 less, so no. 23: 23 × 62,594 = 1,439,662, which is 9 less, so no. 29: 29 × 49,643 = 1,439,647, which is 24 less, so no. 31: 31 × 46,440 = 1,439,640, which is 31 less, so no. 37: 37 × 38,910 = 1,439,670, which is 1 more, so no. 41: 41 × 35,113 = 1,439,633, which is 38 less, so no. 43: 43 × 33,479 = 1,439,657, which is 14 less, so no. 47: 47 × 30,631 = 1,439,657, which is 14 less, same as above. Hmm, this is getting tedious. Maybe 1,439,671 is a prime number? Or perhaps it factors into larger primes.Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Since ( x = 6^n + 1 ), and ( n ) is odd, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can help factorize ( x ). Let me recall that for numbers of the form ( a^n + b^n ), if ( n ) is odd, then ( a + b ) is a factor. So, in this case, ( 6^n + 1^n ), since ( n ) is odd, ( 6 + 1 = 7 ) is a factor. Which we've already observed in both ( n = 5 ) and ( n = 7 ). So, 7 is always a factor when ( n ) is odd.Therefore, ( x = 6^n + 1 = (6 + 1) times text{something} ). So, 7 is always a factor. So, in our problem, since 11 is another prime factor, perhaps for certain ( n ), 11 divides ( x ).So, maybe instead of computing each ( x ) and factorizing, I can set up an equation where ( 6^n + 1 ) is divisible by 11, and find ( n ) such that this holds, and also ( x ) has exactly three distinct prime factors.So, let's formalize this. We have ( x = 6^n + 1 ), which is divisible by 11. So, ( 6^n + 1 equiv 0 mod 11 ). Therefore, ( 6^n equiv -1 mod 11 ). Let's compute the powers of 6 modulo 11 to see the pattern.Compute ( 6^1 mod 11 = 6 )( 6^2 = 36 mod 11 = 3 ) (since 36 - 33 = 3)( 6^3 = 6 times 3 = 18 mod 11 = 7 )( 6^4 = 6 times 7 = 42 mod 11 = 9 ) (42 - 33 = 9)( 6^5 = 6 times 9 = 54 mod 11 = 10 ) (54 - 44 = 10)( 6^6 = 6 times 10 = 60 mod 11 = 5 ) (60 - 55 = 5)( 6^7 = 6 times 5 = 30 mod 11 = 8 ) (30 - 22 = 8)( 6^8 = 6 times 8 = 48 mod 11 = 4 ) (48 - 44 = 4)( 6^9 = 6 times 4 = 24 mod 11 = 2 ) (24 - 22 = 2)( 6^{10} = 6 times 2 = 12 mod 11 = 1 )Ah, so ( 6^{10} equiv 1 mod 11 ). So, the order of 6 modulo 11 is 10. That means that 6^n cycles every 10 exponents modulo 11.We have ( 6^n equiv -1 mod 11 ). So, we need to find ( n ) such that ( 6^n equiv 10 mod 11 ) (since -1 mod 11 is 10). Looking at the powers above:( 6^5 equiv 10 mod 11 ). So, when ( n = 5 ), ( 6^n equiv 10 mod 11 ), which is what we need. Therefore, ( n equiv 5 mod 10 ). So, ( n = 5, 15, 25, ldots )But in our problem, ( n ) is an odd natural number, so 5, 15, 25, etc., are all valid. So, the smallest such ( n ) is 5, which we already saw gives ( x = 7777 = 7 × 11 × 101 ), which has exactly three distinct prime factors.But let's check ( n = 15 ) just to see if ( x = 6^{15} + 1 ) also satisfies the condition of having exactly three distinct prime factors, including 11.Compute ( x = 6^{15} + 1 ). 6^15 is a huge number, but let's see if we can factorize it.We know that ( x = 6^{15} + 1 ). Since ( n = 15 ) is odd, 7 is a factor. So, ( x = 7 times k ), where ( k = (6^{15} + 1)/7 ). Let's compute ( k ):( 6^{15} = (6^5)^3 = 7776^3 ). That's a massive number, but perhaps we can compute ( k ) modulo some primes to see if it's prime or composite.Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that ( x = 6^{15} + 1 ) can be factored further. Let me recall that ( a^n + b^n ) can be factored when ( n ) is odd. Specifically, ( a^n + b^n = (a + b)(a^{n-1} - a^{n-2}b + cdots - ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1}) ). So, in this case, ( x = 6^{15} + 1^{15} = (6 + 1)(6^{14} - 6^{13} + 6^{12} - cdots - 6 + 1) ). So, that gives us 7 times some large number.But whether that large number is prime or composite is another question. If it's composite, then ( x ) would have more than three prime factors. If it's prime, then ( x ) would have two prime factors: 7 and that large prime. But in our case, we need exactly three distinct prime factors, so ( k ) must be a product of two primes, one of which is 11.Wait, but we already know that 11 divides ( x ) when ( n = 5, 15, 25, ) etc. So, for ( n = 15 ), ( x = 6^{15} + 1 ) is divisible by both 7 and 11. So, ( x = 7 × 11 × m ), where ( m ) is some integer. If ( m ) is prime, then ( x ) would have three distinct prime factors. If ( m ) is composite, then ( x ) would have more than three.But calculating ( m ) for ( n = 15 ) is going to be difficult because ( x ) is enormous. So, perhaps ( n = 5 ) is the only feasible solution where ( x ) has exactly three distinct prime factors, including 11.Alternatively, let's think about the number of prime factors. For ( x = 6^n + 1 ), with ( n ) odd, we have 7 as a factor. If 11 is another factor, then the third factor must be another prime. So, ( x = 7 × 11 × p ), where ( p ) is prime. So, ( x = 77p ). Therefore, ( 6^n + 1 = 77p ). So, ( 6^n = 77p - 1 ).But unless ( p ) is very small, ( 6^n ) would be a huge number. So, perhaps the only small ( p ) that works is 101, as in the case of ( n = 5 ). Because for ( n = 5 ), ( x = 7777 = 7 × 11 × 101 ), which are all primes.If I try ( n = 15 ), ( x = 6^{15} + 1 ). Let me compute ( 6^{15} ):6^1 = 66^2 = 366^3 = 2166^4 = 12966^5 = 77766^6 = 466566^7 = 2799366^8 = 1,679,6166^9 = 10,077,6966^10 = 60,466,1766^11 = 362,797,0566^12 = 2,176,782,3366^13 = 13,060,694,0166^14 = 78,364,164,0966^15 = 470,184,984,576So, ( x = 470,184,984,576 + 1 = 470,184,984,577 ). Now, factorizing this number is going to be extremely difficult. But let's see if we can find any small prime factors besides 7 and 11.We already know that 7 and 11 divide ( x ), so let's compute ( x / (7 × 11) = 470,184,984,577 / 77 ). Let me compute that:First, divide 470,184,984,577 by 77.Compute 77 × 6,106,298,449 = 77 × 6,106,298,449. Wait, that's too vague. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 470,184,984,577 ÷ 77.Let me do this division step by step.77 × 6,106,298,449 = ?Wait, maybe it's better to compute 470,184,984,577 ÷ 77.Compute 470,184,984,577 ÷ 77:First, 77 × 6,106,298,449 = ?Wait, perhaps I can compute 470,184,984,577 ÷ 77 as follows:Divide 470,184,984,577 by 7 first: 470,184,984,577 ÷ 7 = 67,169,283,511 (since 7 × 67,169,283,511 = 470,184,984,577). Now, divide 67,169,283,511 by 11.Compute 67,169,283,511 ÷ 11:11 × 6,106,298,499 = 67,169,283,489. Subtract that from 67,169,283,511: 67,169,283,511 - 67,169,283,489 = 22. So, 67,169,283,511 = 11 × 6,106,298,499 + 22. Therefore, 67,169,283,511 ÷ 11 = 6,106,298,499 + 2, so 6,106,298,501 with a remainder of 0. Wait, no, that can't be because 11 × 6,106,298,501 = 67,169,283,511. So, yes, 67,169,283,511 ÷ 11 = 6,106,298,501.Therefore, ( x = 77 × 6,106,298,501 ). Now, is 6,106,298,501 a prime number? That's a huge number. Let me check for small prime factors.Check divisibility by 2: it's odd.Sum of digits: 6+1+0+6+2+9+8+5+0+1 = 38, which isn't divisible by 3.Ends with 1, so not divisible by 5.Check 7: Let's compute 6,106,298,501 ÷ 7. 7 × 872,328,357 = 6,106,298,500 - 7 = 6,106,298,493. So, 6,106,298,501 - 6,106,298,493 = 8. So, remainder 8. Not divisible by 7.Check 11: Let's use the divisibility rule for 11. Subtract the sum of the digits in odd positions from the sum of the digits in even positions.Number: 6,106,298,501Positions (from right, starting at 1): 1 (position 1), 0 (2), 5 (3), 8 (4), 9 (5), 2 (6), 6 (7), 0 (8), 1 (9), 6 (10).Wait, actually, the standard rule is to take the alternating sum of the digits from right to left. Let me write the number as 6 1 0 6 2 9 8 5 0 1.Compute (6 + 0 + 2 + 8 + 0) - (1 + 6 + 9 + 5 + 1) = (6 + 0 + 2 + 8 + 0) = 16; (1 + 6 + 9 + 5 + 1) = 22. 16 - 22 = -6, which isn't divisible by 11, so 11 doesn't divide it.Check 13: Let's compute 6,106,298,501 ÷ 13. 13 × 469,715,269 = 6,106,298,500 - 13 = 6,106,298,487. So, 6,106,298,501 - 6,106,298,487 = 14, which isn't divisible by 13.Check 17: 17 × 359,194,029 = 6,106,298,500 - 17 = 6,106,298,483. So, 6,106,298,501 - 6,106,298,483 = 18, which isn't divisible by 17.This is getting too time-consuming. It's possible that 6,106,298,501 is a prime number, but I can't confirm that without more advanced methods or computational tools. If it is prime, then ( x = 7 × 11 × 6,106,298,501 ), which would give exactly three distinct prime factors. However, given the size of the number, it's more likely to be composite, meaning ( x ) would have more than three prime factors, which doesn't fit the problem's condition.Therefore, it's probable that ( n = 5 ) is the only solution where ( x = 6^n + 1 ) has exactly three distinct prime factors, one of which is 11. For higher values of ( n ), ( x ) either doesn't include 11 as a factor or has more than three prime factors.So, after this thorough exploration, I conclude that the value of ( x ) is 7777.**Final Answer**The value of ( x ) is boxed{7777}."},{"question":"Mastering knowledge about earthquakes to enhance awareness of earthquake prevention.

Find the smallest possible area of triangle ABC.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible area of triangle ABC. The points given are A = (-1,1,2), B = (1,2,3), and C = (t,1,1), where t is a real number. Hmm, interesting. I remember that the area of a triangle in 3D space can be found using the cross product of two sides. Let me try to recall the formula.First, I think I need to find two vectors that form the sides of the triangle. Since the triangle is ABC, I can consider vectors AB and AC, or maybe AB and BC. Wait, actually, since point C is variable depending on t, maybe I should express vectors AB and AC in terms of t and then compute the cross product.Let me write down the coordinates:Point A: (-1, 1, 2)Point B: (1, 2, 3)Point C: (t, 1, 1)So, vector AB is B - A, which would be (1 - (-1), 2 - 1, 3 - 2) = (2, 1, 1).Similarly, vector AC is C - A, which is (t - (-1), 1 - 1, 1 - 2) = (t + 1, 0, -1).Okay, so now I have vectors AB = (2, 1, 1) and AC = (t + 1, 0, -1). The area of triangle ABC is half the magnitude of the cross product of AB and AC.So, first, let me compute the cross product AB × AC.The cross product formula is:If vector u = (u1, u2, u3) and vector v = (v1, v2, v3), then u × v = (u2v3 - u3v2, u3v1 - u1v3, u1v2 - u2v1).Applying this to AB and AC:AB × AC = ( (1)(-1) - (1)(0), (1)(t + 1) - (2)(-1), (2)(0) - (1)(t + 1) )Let me compute each component step by step:First component: (1)(-1) - (1)(0) = -1 - 0 = -1Second component: (1)(t + 1) - (2)(-1) = (t + 1) + 2 = t + 3Third component: (2)(0) - (1)(t + 1) = 0 - (t + 1) = -t - 1So, AB × AC = (-1, t + 3, -t - 1)Now, the magnitude of this cross product vector is sqrt[ (-1)^2 + (t + 3)^2 + (-t - 1)^2 ]Let me compute each term:(-1)^2 = 1(t + 3)^2 = t^2 + 6t + 9(-t - 1)^2 = t^2 + 2t + 1So, adding them up:1 + (t^2 + 6t + 9) + (t^2 + 2t + 1) = 1 + t^2 + 6t + 9 + t^2 + 2t + 1Combine like terms:t^2 + t^2 = 2t^26t + 2t = 8t1 + 9 + 1 = 11So, the magnitude squared is 2t^2 + 8t + 11.Therefore, the magnitude is sqrt(2t^2 + 8t + 11).Hence, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2) * sqrt(2t^2 + 8t + 11).Now, to find the smallest possible area, I need to minimize this expression with respect to t. Since the square root function is a monotonically increasing function, minimizing sqrt(f(t)) is equivalent to minimizing f(t). So, I can instead minimize the expression inside the square root, which is 2t^2 + 8t + 11.This is a quadratic function in t, and since the coefficient of t^2 is positive (2), it opens upwards, meaning its minimum occurs at the vertex.The vertex of a quadratic function at^2 + bt + c is at t = -b/(2a). So here, a = 2, b = 8.Thus, t = -8/(2*2) = -8/4 = -2.So, the minimum occurs at t = -2. Let me compute the minimum value of 2t^2 + 8t + 11 at t = -2.Plugging in t = -2:2*(-2)^2 + 8*(-2) + 11 = 2*4 + (-16) + 11 = 8 - 16 + 11 = (8 + 11) - 16 = 19 - 16 = 3.So, the minimum value of 2t^2 + 8t + 11 is 3, which occurs at t = -2.Therefore, the minimum magnitude of the cross product is sqrt(3), and the minimum area is (1/2)*sqrt(3).Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.Wait, 2*(-2)^2 is 2*4=8, 8*(-2) is -16, and then +11. So 8 -16 is -8, -8 +11 is 3. Yeah, that's correct.So, the minimum value inside the square root is 3, so the minimum area is (1/2)*sqrt(3).But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using calculus?Alternatively, I could take the derivative of the area function with respect to t and set it to zero to find the minimum.But since the area is (1/2)*sqrt(2t^2 + 8t + 11), let's denote f(t) = sqrt(2t^2 + 8t + 11). To minimize f(t), we can minimize f(t)^2 = 2t^2 + 8t + 11, which is what I did earlier.So, taking the derivative of f(t)^2 with respect to t: d/dt [2t^2 + 8t + 11] = 4t + 8. Setting this equal to zero: 4t + 8 = 0 => t = -2. So, same result.Therefore, the minimal area is (1/2)*sqrt(3).Wait, but let me compute sqrt(3)/2. Is that correct? Because 2t^2 +8t +11 at t=-2 is 3, so sqrt(3), and half of that is sqrt(3)/2.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think geometrically. The area is minimized when the height from point C to the line AB is minimized. So, perhaps the minimal area occurs when point C is closest to the line AB.Wait, that might be another approach. Let me try that.So, the minimal distance from point C to the line AB would give the minimal height, hence minimal area.So, the formula for the distance from a point to a line in 3D is |(C - A) × direction_vector| / |direction_vector|.Wait, the direction vector of AB is AB itself, which is (2,1,1). So, the distance from C to AB is |(C - A) × AB| / |AB|.Wait, but (C - A) is AC, which is (t +1, 0, -1). So, AC × AB is the same as AB × AC, which we already computed as (-1, t + 3, -t -1). The magnitude of that is sqrt(2t^2 +8t +11). So, the distance is sqrt(2t^2 +8t +11)/|AB|.What's |AB|? AB is (2,1,1), so |AB| = sqrt(2^2 +1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(4 +1 +1) = sqrt(6).Therefore, the distance is sqrt(2t^2 +8t +11)/sqrt(6). Then, the area is (1/2)*base*height, where base is |AB| = sqrt(6), and height is the distance from C to AB, which is sqrt(2t^2 +8t +11)/sqrt(6).So, area = (1/2)*sqrt(6)*(sqrt(2t^2 +8t +11)/sqrt(6)) = (1/2)*sqrt(2t^2 +8t +11). So, same expression as before.Therefore, the minimal area occurs when 2t^2 +8t +11 is minimized, which is at t=-2, giving area sqrt(3)/2.So, both approaches give the same result, which is reassuring.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute the coordinates of point C when t = -2.Point C would be (-2,1,1). So, let me compute vectors AB and AC when t = -2.AB is still (2,1,1). AC is (-2 +1, 0, -1) = (-1,0,-1).Compute the cross product AB × AC:AB = (2,1,1), AC = (-1,0,-1)Cross product:i component: (1)(-1) - (1)(0) = -1 - 0 = -1j component: (1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = -1 + 2 = 1k component: (2)(0) - (1)(-1) = 0 +1 = 1So, AB × AC = (-1,1,1)Wait, earlier I had AB × AC = (-1, t +3, -t -1). Plugging t = -2, that would be (-1, (-2) + 3, -(-2) -1) = (-1,1,1). So, same result.The magnitude of (-1,1,1) is sqrt[(-1)^2 +1^2 +1^2] = sqrt[1 +1 +1] = sqrt(3). So, the area is (1/2)*sqrt(3). So, that's consistent.Therefore, I think I can confidently say that the minimal area is sqrt(3)/2.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute the area when t is something else, say t=0.If t=0, point C is (0,1,1). Then, AC = (0 +1, 0, -1) = (1,0,-1). AB is (2,1,1). Cross product AB × AC is:i: 1*(-1) -1*0 = -1j: 1*1 -2*(-1) =1 +2=3k: 2*0 -1*1= -1So, cross product is (-1,3,-1). The magnitude is sqrt(1 +9 +1)=sqrt(11). So, area is sqrt(11)/2, which is larger than sqrt(3)/2. So, that makes sense.Another test, t=-1. Point C is (-1,1,1). Then, AC = (-1 +1,0,-1)=(0,0,-1). AB is (2,1,1). Cross product AB × AC is:i:1*(-1) -1*0 = -1j:1*0 -2*(-1)=0 +2=2k:2*0 -1*0=0So, cross product is (-1,2,0). The magnitude is sqrt(1 +4 +0)=sqrt(5). Area is sqrt(5)/2, which is still larger than sqrt(3)/2.So, seems like t=-2 gives the minimal area.Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the line AB and find the point on AB closest to C, then compute the distance, but that might be more involved.Wait, but actually, the minimal distance from C to AB is the minimal height, which we already used.Alternatively, perhaps using projection.Wait, another approach: express point C as a point moving along the line x = t, y=1, z=1. So, it's a line in 3D space. Then, the minimal distance between this line and the line AB would give the minimal height, hence minimal area.But that might be more complicated, but let me try.The line AB can be parametrized as A + s*(AB), where s is a parameter.So, AB vector is (2,1,1). So, parametric equations for AB:x = -1 + 2sy = 1 + sz = 2 + sSimilarly, the line for point C is x = t, y=1, z=1. So, parametric equations:x = ty =1z=1So, to find the minimal distance between these two lines, we can use the formula for the distance between two skew lines.Wait, but are these lines skew? Let me check.First, check if they intersect. For some s and t, do we have:-1 + 2s = t1 + s =12 + s =1From the second equation: 1 + s =1 => s=0From the third equation: 2 + s =1 => s = -1But s cannot be both 0 and -1, so no intersection. Therefore, the lines are skew.The distance between two skew lines can be found using the formula:| (C - A) ⋅ (AB × AC) | / |AB × AC|Wait, no, actually, the formula is |(P2 - P1) ⋅ (v1 × v2)| / |v1 × v2|, where P1 and P2 are points on each line, and v1, v2 are direction vectors.Wait, let me recall the exact formula.The distance between two skew lines is |(P2 - P1) ⋅ (v1 × v2)| / |v1 × v2|.In our case, line AB has point A = (-1,1,2) and direction vector AB = (2,1,1).Line C is parametrized as (t,1,1), which can be written as point C0 = (0,1,1) when t=0, and direction vector (1,0,0), since x increases by 1 as t increases by 1, y and z remain constant.Wait, actually, no. The line for point C is x = t, y=1, z=1. So, it's a line with direction vector (1,0,0), since as t increases, x increases by 1, y and z stay the same.So, point P1 on line AB is A = (-1,1,2), direction vector v1 = AB = (2,1,1).Point P2 on line C is C0 = (0,1,1), direction vector v2 = (1,0,0).So, vector P2 - P1 = (0 - (-1), 1 -1, 1 -2) = (1, 0, -1).Compute v1 × v2:v1 = (2,1,1), v2 = (1,0,0)Cross product:i:1*0 -1*0=0j:1*1 -2*0=1k:2*0 -1*1=-1So, v1 × v2 = (0,1,-1)The magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(0^2 +1^2 +(-1)^2)=sqrt(0 +1 +1)=sqrt(2)Then, the distance is |(P2 - P1) ⋅ (v1 × v2)| / |v1 × v2|Compute (P2 - P1) ⋅ (v1 × v2):(1,0,-1) ⋅ (0,1,-1) = 1*0 + 0*1 + (-1)*(-1) = 0 + 0 +1=1So, the distance is |1| / sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2)Wait, but earlier, we found the minimal distance from C to AB is sqrt(2t^2 +8t +11)/sqrt(6). At t=-2, that distance was sqrt(3)/sqrt(6) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(6) = 1/sqrt(2). So, same result.Therefore, the minimal distance is 1/sqrt(2), which occurs when t=-2.Therefore, the minimal area is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*sqrt(6)*(1/sqrt(2)) = (1/2)*sqrt(6/2) = (1/2)*sqrt(3). So, same as before.Therefore, regardless of the approach, the minimal area is sqrt(3)/2.So, I think I'm confident that the minimal area is sqrt(3)/2.**Final Answer**The smallest possible area of triangle (ABC) is (boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}})."},{"question":"Simply the expression[frac{(sqrt{2} - 1)^{1 - sqrt{3}}}{(sqrt{2} + 1)^{1 + sqrt{3}}},]writing your answer as a - b sqrt{c}, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is not divisible by the square of a prime.","answer":"Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: [frac{(sqrt{2} - 1)^{1 - sqrt{3}}}{(sqrt{2} + 1)^{1 + sqrt{3}}}.] The goal is to write it in the form (a - b sqrt{c}), where (a), (b), and (c) are positive integers, and (c) isn't divisible by the square of a prime. Hmm, that sounds like it involves some exponent rules and maybe recognizing a pattern or identity.First, let me look at the numerator and the denominator. Both have ((sqrt{2} - 1)) and ((sqrt{2} + 1)) raised to some exponents. I remember that ((sqrt{2} - 1)) and ((sqrt{2} + 1)) are reciprocals of each other because ((sqrt{2} - 1)(sqrt{2} + 1) = 2 - 1 = 1). So, that might be useful here.Let me write that down: ((sqrt{2} - 1) = frac{1}{sqrt{2} + 1}). So, maybe I can rewrite the numerator in terms of ((sqrt{2} + 1)). Let's try that.The numerator is ((sqrt{2} - 1)^{1 - sqrt{3}}). Substituting the reciprocal, that becomes (left(frac{1}{sqrt{2} + 1}right)^{1 - sqrt{3}}). Which is the same as ((sqrt{2} + 1)^{-(1 - sqrt{3})}). Simplifying the exponent, that's ((sqrt{2} + 1)^{-1 + sqrt{3}}).So now, the entire expression becomes: [frac{(sqrt{2} + 1)^{-1 + sqrt{3}}}{(sqrt{2} + 1)^{1 + sqrt{3}}}.] Since the base is the same, I can subtract the exponents. Let me compute the exponent: (-1 + sqrt{3} - (1 + sqrt{3}) = -1 + sqrt{3} -1 - sqrt{3} = -2). So, the expression simplifies to ((sqrt{2} + 1)^{-2}).Which is the same as (frac{1}{(sqrt{2} + 1)^2}). Now, I need to compute ((sqrt{2} + 1)^2). Let me expand that: ((sqrt{2})^2 + 2 times sqrt{2} times 1 + 1^2 = 2 + 2sqrt{2} + 1 = 3 + 2sqrt{2}).So, the expression becomes (frac{1}{3 + 2sqrt{2}}). Hmm, this is a denominator with a radical. I remember that to rationalize the denominator, I can multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of (3 + 2sqrt{2}) is (3 - 2sqrt{2}).Let me do that: [frac{1}{3 + 2sqrt{2}} times frac{3 - 2sqrt{2}}{3 - 2sqrt{2}} = frac{3 - 2sqrt{2}}{(3)^2 - (2sqrt{2})^2}.] Calculating the denominator: (9 - (4 times 2) = 9 - 8 = 1). So, the expression simplifies to (3 - 2sqrt{2}).Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.1. I recognized that ((sqrt{2} - 1)) is the reciprocal of ((sqrt{2} + 1)). That part seems correct.2. I rewrote the numerator as ((sqrt{2} + 1)^{-1 + sqrt{3}}). Then, when dividing by ((sqrt{2} + 1)^{1 + sqrt{3}}), I subtracted the exponents: (-1 + sqrt{3} - 1 - sqrt{3} = -2). That seems right.3. So, the expression becomes ((sqrt{2} + 1)^{-2}), which is (1/(sqrt{2} + 1)^2). Then, expanding ((sqrt{2} + 1)^2) gives (3 + 2sqrt{2}). Correct.4. Rationalizing the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (3 - 2sqrt{2}) gives (3 - 2sqrt{2}) over 1, so the result is (3 - 2sqrt{2}).Hmm, that seems consistent. So, the simplified expression is (3 - 2sqrt{2}), which is already in the form (a - bsqrt{c}) where (a = 3), (b = 2), and (c = 2). Since 2 is a prime and isn't divisible by the square of a prime, that should be the final answer.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute the original expression numerically and see if it matches (3 - 2sqrt{2}).First, compute ((sqrt{2} - 1)) and ((sqrt{2} + 1)). (sqrt{2} approx 1.4142), so (sqrt{2} - 1 approx 0.4142), and (sqrt{2} + 1 approx 2.4142).Compute the numerator: ((sqrt{2} - 1)^{1 - sqrt{3}} approx 0.4142^{1 - 1.732} approx 0.4142^{-0.732}). Negative exponent means reciprocal, so (1 / 0.4142^{0.732}). Let me compute (0.4142^{0.732}). Taking natural log: (ln(0.4142) approx -0.879), multiplied by 0.732: (-0.879 times 0.732 approx -0.643). Exponentiating: (e^{-0.643} approx 0.526). So, reciprocal is approximately 1.901.Denominator: ((sqrt{2} + 1)^{1 + sqrt{3}} approx 2.4142^{1 + 1.732} approx 2.4142^{2.732}). Let me compute that. Taking natural log: (ln(2.4142) approx 0.881), multiplied by 2.732: (0.881 times 2.732 approx 2.405). Exponentiating: (e^{2.405} approx 11.08).So, the entire expression is approximately (1.901 / 11.08 approx 0.1716).Now, compute (3 - 2sqrt{2}). (sqrt{2} approx 1.4142), so (2sqrt{2} approx 2.8284). Then, (3 - 2.8284 approx 0.1716). That matches the numerical value I got earlier. So, that confirms that the simplified expression is indeed (3 - 2sqrt{2}).Therefore, the answer is (3 - 2sqrt{2}), which is in the required form.**Final Answer**The simplified expression is boxed{3 - 2sqrt{2}}."},{"question":"While using a skipping rope, Emily jumps 52 times in 60 seconds.

However, the classroom helpers erased one of the numbers written on the board. When the lesson began, it turned out that the sum of the remaining numbers was 1703. What number did the helpers erase?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where a teacher wrote all the angles of a certain convex polygon on the board. Then some helpers erased one of the numbers, and now the sum of the remaining angles is 1703 degrees. I need to figure out which number was erased. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon depends on the number of sides it has. The formula for the sum is ((n-2) times 180) degrees, where (n) is the number of sides. So, if I can figure out how many sides the polygon has, I can find the total sum of all the angles and then subtract 1703 to find the erased angle.But wait, I don't know how many sides the polygon has. Hmm, so maybe I can figure that out based on the information given. Let me denote the number of sides as (n). Then, the total sum of the angles is ((n-2) times 180). Since one angle was erased, the sum of the remaining angles is 1703. So, the erased angle must be equal to the total sum minus 1703. That is, erased angle (= (n-2) times 180 - 1703).But I don't know (n), so I need another equation or a way to find (n). Maybe I can figure out possible values of (n) such that the total sum is just a bit more than 1703, and the difference is a reasonable angle measure.Let me think about the possible range for (n). Since it's a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than 180 degrees. So, the erased angle must be less than 180. Therefore, the total sum must be (1703 + x), where (x < 180). So, the total sum is between 1703 and 1883.Let me compute the total sum for different (n) and see where it falls in that range.Let me start by estimating (n). The total sum is approximately 1703, so let's see:If (n = 11), total sum is ((11-2) times 180 = 9 times 180 = 1620). That's too low because 1620 is less than 1703.If (n = 12), total sum is (10 times 180 = 1800). Hmm, 1800 is within our range since 1703 < 1800 < 1883. So, maybe (n = 12).Wait, let me check (n = 13). That would be (11 times 180 = 1980), which is higher than 1883, so that's too big. So, (n) must be 12.Therefore, the total sum is 1800 degrees. The erased angle is then (1800 - 1703 = 97) degrees. Hmm, 97 is less than 180, so that makes sense for a convex polygon.Wait, but let me double-check. If (n = 12), total sum is 1800. If one angle was erased, and the remaining sum is 1703, then the erased angle is 97. That seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me check (n = 11) again. If (n = 11), total sum is 1620. Then, the erased angle would be (1620 - 1703), which is negative. That doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative angle. So, (n) can't be 11.What about (n = 10)? Total sum is (8 times 180 = 1440). Then, erased angle would be (1440 - 1703 = -263). Also negative, so nope.So, (n = 12) is the only feasible number of sides here because it gives a positive erased angle less than 180. Therefore, the erased angle is 97 degrees.Wait, hold on, let me think again. If the total sum is 1800, and the remaining sum is 1703, subtracting gives 97. But is 97 a reasonable angle for a convex polygon? Yes, because all angles in a convex polygon are less than 180. So, 97 is fine.Alternatively, could (n) be 13? Then, total sum is 1980. Then, the erased angle would be (1980 - 1703 = 277). But 277 is more than 180, which would make the polygon concave or even self-intersecting, which contradicts the given that it's convex. So, (n) can't be 13.Similarly, for (n = 14), total sum is (12 times 180 = 2160). Then, erased angle is (2160 - 1703 = 457), which is way too big. So, definitely not.So, yeah, (n = 12) is the only possible number of sides. Therefore, the erased angle is 97 degrees.Wait, just to make sure, is there any other possible (n) that I might have missed? Let's see:If (n = 12), total sum is 1800.If (n = 11), total sum is 1620.So, 1703 is between 1620 and 1800, but 1703 - 1620 = 83, which is the amount by which 1703 exceeds the total sum for (n = 11). But since (n = 11) only sums to 1620, which is less than 1703, it's impossible because you can't have a sum of angles greater than the total sum.Therefore, only (n = 12) makes sense here, leading to an erased angle of 97 degrees.I think that's solid. So, the erased number is 97 degrees.**Final Answer**The erased number is boxed{97}."},{"question":"The positive integer   n  has the following property:if the three last digits of  n  are removed, the number  sqrt[3]{n}  remains. Find  n .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a positive integer ( n ) such that if I remove the last three digits, the number that's left is the cube root of ( n ). Hmm, that sounds interesting. Let me try to break it down.First, let me rephrase the problem in my own words. If I have a number ( n ), and when I chop off the last three digits, what's left is ( sqrt[3]{n} ). So, essentially, ( n ) is a number where the cube root is the number formed by all the digits except the last three. That means ( n ) must be a cube of some integer, right?Let me denote the cube root of ( n ) as ( k ). So, ( n = k^3 ). According to the problem, if I remove the last three digits of ( n ), I get ( k ). Removing the last three digits is the same as dividing by 1000 and taking the integer part, which is essentially ( lfloor frac{n}{1000} rfloor ). But since ( n = k^3 ), this operation should give me back ( k ). So, mathematically, I can write this as:[leftlfloor frac{k^3}{1000} rightrfloor = k]But since ( k ) is an integer, and ( k^3 ) is also an integer, the division ( frac{k^3}{1000} ) must result in a number whose integer part is exactly ( k ). So, this implies that:[k leq frac{k^3}{1000} < k + 1]Let me write that as two inequalities:1. ( frac{k^3}{1000} geq k )2. ( frac{k^3}{1000} < k + 1 )Let me solve the first inequality:1. ( frac{k^3}{1000} geq k )Multiply both sides by 1000:( k^3 geq 1000k )Divide both sides by ( k ) (since ( k ) is positive, we can do this without changing the inequality sign):( k^2 geq 1000 )Take square roots:( k geq sqrt{1000} )( sqrt{1000} ) is approximately 31.62, so ( k ) must be at least 32.Now, the second inequality:2. ( frac{k^3}{1000} < k + 1 )Multiply both sides by 1000:( k^3 < 1000k + 1000 )Bring all terms to one side:( k^3 - 1000k - 1000 < 0 )Hmm, this is a cubic inequality. Let me try to find the roots of the equation ( k^3 - 1000k - 1000 = 0 ) to find the critical points.This might be a bit tricky. Maybe I can try plugging in some integer values for ( k ) to see where the expression crosses zero.Let me start with ( k = 10 ):( 1000 - 10000 - 1000 = -10000 ) which is less than 0.Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe try a larger ( k ). Let me try ( k = 10 ) is too low. Let me try ( k = 100 ):( 1,000,000 - 100,000 - 1000 = 899,000 ) which is positive.So, somewhere between 10 and 100, the expression goes from negative to positive. But since ( k ) must be at least 32 from the first inequality, let me try ( k = 32 ):( 32^3 - 1000*32 - 1000 = 32768 - 32000 - 1000 = -232 ) which is negative.Okay, so at ( k = 32 ), the expression is negative. Let me try ( k = 33 ):( 35937 - 33000 - 1000 = 1937 ) which is positive.So, the expression crosses zero between ( k = 32 ) and ( k = 33 ). Therefore, the inequality ( k^3 - 1000k - 1000 < 0 ) holds for ( k < 33 ). Since ( k ) must be an integer, the maximum possible ( k ) is 32.But wait, from the first inequality, ( k geq 32 ). So, combining both, ( k ) must be exactly 32.Wait, hold on. If ( k = 32 ), let's check if it satisfies both conditions.First, compute ( n = 32^3 = 32768 ).Now, if we remove the last three digits of ( n ), which is 32768, we get 32. Because 32768 divided by 1000 is 32.768, and taking the integer part gives 32. So, yes, that works.But let me verify if ( k = 32 ) is the only solution. Since the inequality ( k^3 - 1000k - 1000 < 0 ) holds for ( k < 33 ), and ( k geq 32 ), the only integer ( k ) that satisfies both is 32.Therefore, ( n = 32^3 = 32768 ).Wait, but just to make sure, let me test ( k = 32 ) and see if removing the last three digits gives me back 32.( n = 32768 ). Removing the last three digits: 32768 becomes 32. Yep, that's correct.Is there any other number that could satisfy this? Let me think.Suppose ( k = 31 ). Then ( n = 31^3 = 29791 ). Removing the last three digits would give 29, which is not equal to 31. So, that doesn't work.Similarly, ( k = 33 ): ( n = 35937 ). Removing the last three digits gives 35, which is not 33. So, that doesn't work either.Therefore, 32 is the only integer that satisfies the condition.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me think about the exact wording of the problem. It says, \\"if the three last digits of ( n ) are removed, the number ( sqrt[3]{n} ) remains.\\" So, does that mean that ( n ) must have exactly four digits? Because if I remove three digits, the remaining number is ( k ). So, if ( n ) has four digits, removing three would leave one digit. But 32 is a two-digit number. Hmm, that seems contradictory.Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again.\\"The positive integer ( n ) has the following property: if the three last digits of ( n ) are removed, the number ( sqrt[3]{n} ) remains. Find ( n ).\\"So, it's not necessarily that ( n ) has four digits, but that removing three digits from the end gives the cube root. So, ( n ) must have at least four digits because you can't remove three digits from a number with fewer than three digits.So, ( n ) must have four or more digits. But when we remove three digits, the remaining number is ( k ). So, if ( n ) has four digits, removing three would leave one digit, which is ( k ). But in our case, ( k = 32 ), which is two digits. So, that suggests ( n ) must have five digits because removing three digits from a five-digit number leaves two digits, which is ( k = 32 ).Wait, so ( n ) is a five-digit number where the first two digits are 32, and the last three digits are something. Let me check ( 32^3 ). 32 cubed is 32768, which is a five-digit number. So, removing the last three digits (768) leaves 32, which is indeed the cube root. So, that works.But just to make sure, let me consider if there could be a larger ( n ) with more digits. For example, suppose ( n ) is a six-digit number. Then, removing three digits would leave a three-digit number, which would be ( k ). So, ( k ) would be a three-digit number, and ( n = k^3 ) would be a six or seven-digit number.Wait, let's test this idea. Let me pick a three-digit ( k ), say ( k = 100 ). Then ( n = 100^3 = 1,000,000 ). Removing the last three digits gives 1000, which is not equal to ( k = 100 ). So, that doesn't work.Wait, so maybe ( k ) must be such that ( k^3 ) has exactly three more digits than ( k ). So, if ( k ) is a two-digit number, ( k^3 ) is a five or six-digit number. But 32 is a two-digit number, and 32^3 is a five-digit number, so removing three digits leaves two digits, which is ( k ). So, that works.Similarly, if ( k ) is a three-digit number, ( k^3 ) is a six or seven-digit number. So, removing three digits would leave a three or four-digit number, which would have to be ( k ). Let me test ( k = 100 ): ( n = 1,000,000 ). Removing three digits gives 1000, which is not equal to 100. So, that doesn't work.Wait, maybe ( k = 100 ) is too low. Let me try a larger ( k ). Let's say ( k = 1000 ). Then ( n = 1,000,000,000 ). Removing three digits gives 1,000,000, which is not equal to 1000. Hmm, that's not helpful.Alternatively, maybe ( k = 100 ) is too small. Let me try ( k = 400 ). Then ( n = 400^3 = 64,000,000 ). Removing three digits gives 64,000, which is not equal to 400. So, that doesn't work either.Wait, perhaps there's no such ( k ) beyond two digits? Let me think.If ( k ) is a three-digit number, then ( k^3 ) is at least ( 100^3 = 1,000,000 ) (a seven-digit number) and up to ( 999^3 = 997,002,999 ) (a nine-digit number). Removing three digits from a seven-digit number would leave a four-digit number, which would have to be equal to ( k ), a three-digit number. That's impossible because four digits can't equal three digits. Similarly, removing three digits from an eight or nine-digit number would leave five or six digits, which again can't equal a three-digit ( k ). So, it seems that only two-digit ( k ) can satisfy the condition where ( k^3 ) is a five-digit number, and removing three digits leaves a two-digit number.Therefore, ( k = 32 ) is the only solution because ( 32^3 = 32768 ), and removing the last three digits (768) leaves 32.Wait, just to double-check, let me compute ( 32^3 ) again:( 32 times 32 = 1024 )( 1024 times 32 = 32768 )Yes, that's correct. So, 32768 is a five-digit number. Removing the last three digits (768) gives 32, which is the cube root. Perfect.Is there any other two-digit ( k ) that could satisfy this? Let's check ( k = 31 ):( 31^3 = 29791 ). Removing the last three digits gives 29, which is not 31.( k = 33 ): ( 33^3 = 35937 ). Removing the last three digits gives 35, which is not 33.( k = 34 ): ( 34^3 = 39304 ). Removing the last three digits gives 39, which is not 34.( k = 35 ): ( 35^3 = 42875 ). Removing the last three digits gives 42, which is not 35.Similarly, ( k = 30 ): ( 30^3 = 27000 ). Removing the last three digits gives 27, which is not 30.So, none of these other two-digit numbers work. Therefore, 32 is indeed the only solution.Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me consider if ( k ) could be a single-digit number. For example, ( k = 5 ): ( 5^3 = 125 ). Removing the last three digits would leave nothing, which doesn't make sense. Similarly, ( k = 10 ): ( 10^3 = 1000 ). Removing the last three digits gives 1, which is not 10. So, single-digit ( k ) don't work either.Therefore, after checking all possibilities, it seems that ( n = 32768 ) is the only number that satisfies the given condition.**Final Answer**The positive integer ( n ) is boxed{32768}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=4cos x sinleft(x+ frac{pi}{6}right).(1) Find the axis of symmetry for f(x);(2) Find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) in the interval left[- frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{4}right].","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = 4 cos x sin(x + π/6). I need to find the axis of symmetry for f(x) and then determine its maximum and minimum values in the interval [-π/6, π/4]. Hmm, let me take this step by step.First, part (1): Find the axis of symmetry for f(x). Hmm, axis of symmetry usually refers to a vertical line that divides the graph of a function into two mirror images. For trigonometric functions, especially sine and cosine, which are periodic, the axis of symmetry might be related to their midline or perhaps a line where the function reaches its maximum or minimum.But wait, f(x) is a product of cos x and sin(x + π/6). Maybe I should simplify this expression first using a trigonometric identity. Let me recall the product-to-sum formulas. The product of sine and cosine can be expressed as a sum. Specifically, the identity is:sin A cos B = [sin(A + B) + sin(A - B)] / 2So, in this case, A is (x + π/6) and B is x. Let me apply that.f(x) = 4 cos x sin(x + π/6) = 4 * [sin((x + π/6) + x) + sin((x + π/6) - x)] / 2Simplify the arguments inside the sine functions:First term: (x + π/6) + x = 2x + π/6Second term: (x + π/6) - x = π/6So, substituting back:f(x) = 4 * [sin(2x + π/6) + sin(π/6)] / 2Simplify the constants:4 divided by 2 is 2, so:f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6) + 2 sin(π/6)Now, sin(π/6) is 1/2, so:f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6) + 2*(1/2) = 2 sin(2x + π/6) + 1So, f(x) simplifies to 2 sin(2x + π/6) + 1. That's a much simpler form.Now, to find the axis of symmetry. Since f(x) is a sinusoidal function, it's symmetric about its midline. The midline of a sine function of the form A sin(Bx + C) + D is y = D. In this case, D is 1, so the midline is y = 1. But wait, the question is about the axis of symmetry, which is a vertical line, not a horizontal line.Hmm, maybe I misunderstood. For a function like this, which is sinusoidal, the axis of symmetry could be the line where the function reaches its maximum or minimum. Alternatively, it might be the line equidistant from the points where the function crosses the midline.Wait, let me think. For a standard sine function, y = sin(x), it's symmetric about the line x = π/2, which is where it reaches its maximum. Similarly, y = cos(x) is symmetric about x = 0. So, perhaps for this function, the axis of symmetry is the vertical line where the function reaches its maximum.Given that f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6) + 1, let's find where it reaches its maximum. The maximum value of sin is 1, so the maximum of f(x) is 2*1 + 1 = 3. The function reaches this maximum when sin(2x + π/6) = 1, which occurs when 2x + π/6 = π/2 + 2πk, where k is any integer.Solving for x:2x + π/6 = π/2 + 2πkSubtract π/6:2x = π/2 - π/6 + 2πk = (3π/6 - π/6) + 2πk = (2π/6) + 2πk = π/3 + 2πkDivide by 2:x = π/6 + πkSo, the function reaches its maximum at x = π/6 + πk. The principal maximum within one period is at x = π/6. So, the axis of symmetry is the vertical line x = π/6.Wait, but is that the only axis of symmetry? Or are there multiple axes? Since the function is periodic, it will have multiple axes of symmetry spaced by half the period. The period of f(x) is 2π / |B|, where B is the coefficient of x inside the sine function. Here, B is 2, so the period is π. Therefore, the function repeats every π units. So, the axes of symmetry would be at x = π/6 + (π/2)k, where k is any integer.But the question just asks for the axis of symmetry, not all of them. So, perhaps the primary one is x = π/6.Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the vertical line around which the function is symmetric in its fundamental period. Since the function is a sine function with a phase shift, it's symmetric about its midline crossing. Wait, actually, the axis of symmetry for a sine function is the line where it reaches its maximum or minimum. So, in this case, x = π/6 is where it reaches the maximum, so that's the axis of symmetry.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the function is symmetric about the line x = π/6. Let's test this. Let me take a point x = π/6 + h and x = π/6 - h and see if f(π/6 + h) = f(π/6 - h).Compute f(π/6 + h):f(π/6 + h) = 2 sin(2*(π/6 + h) + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(π/3 + 2h + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(π/2 + 2h) + 1Similarly, f(π/6 - h):f(π/6 - h) = 2 sin(2*(π/6 - h) + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(π/3 - 2h + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(π/2 - 2h) + 1Now, sin(π/2 + 2h) = cos(2h) and sin(π/2 - 2h) = cos(2h). So both f(π/6 + h) and f(π/6 - h) equal 2 cos(2h) + 1. Therefore, f(π/6 + h) = f(π/6 - h), which means the function is symmetric about x = π/6. So, that's the axis of symmetry.Okay, so part (1) is x = π/6.Now, moving on to part (2): Find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) in the interval [-π/6, π/4].We have f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6) + 1. To find the maximum and minimum on the interval, we can use calculus or analyze the sine function's behavior.Since f(x) is a sinusoidal function with amplitude 2, shifted up by 1, its maximum value is 3 and minimum is -1. However, we need to check if these extrema occur within the given interval.Alternatively, we can find critical points by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero.Let me try both approaches.First, the calculus approach:f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6) + 1f'(x) = 2 * cos(2x + π/6) * 2 = 4 cos(2x + π/6)Set derivative equal to zero:4 cos(2x + π/6) = 0cos(2x + π/6) = 0Solutions occur when 2x + π/6 = π/2 + π k, where k is integer.Solve for x:2x = π/2 - π/6 + π k = (3π/6 - π/6) + π k = (2π/6) + π k = π/3 + π kx = π/6 + (π/2) kSo critical points are at x = π/6 + (π/2) k.Now, let's find which of these critical points lie within the interval [-π/6, π/4].Compute x = π/6 + (π/2) k for different k:For k = 0: x = π/6 ≈ 0.523. Is π/6 within [-π/6, π/4]? π/4 ≈ 0.785, so π/6 ≈ 0.523 is less than π/4, so yes.For k = -1: x = π/6 - π/2 = -π/3 ≈ -1.047. Is -π/3 within [-π/6, π/4]? -π/3 ≈ -1.047 is less than -π/6 ≈ -0.523, so no.For k = 1: x = π/6 + π/2 = 2π/3 ≈ 2.094. That's way beyond π/4, so no.So the only critical point in the interval is x = π/6.Therefore, we need to evaluate f(x) at the critical point x = π/6 and at the endpoints x = -π/6 and x = π/4.Compute f(-π/6):f(-π/6) = 2 sin(2*(-π/6) + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(-π/3 + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(-π/6) + 1sin(-π/6) = -1/2, so:f(-π/6) = 2*(-1/2) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0Compute f(π/6):f(π/6) = 2 sin(2*(π/6) + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(π/3 + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(π/2) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3Compute f(π/4):f(π/4) = 2 sin(2*(π/4) + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(π/2 + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(2π/3) + 1sin(2π/3) = √3/2, so:f(π/4) = 2*(√3/2) + 1 = √3 + 1 ≈ 1.732 + 1 = 2.732So, comparing the values:f(-π/6) = 0f(π/6) = 3f(π/4) ≈ 2.732Therefore, the maximum value is 3 at x = π/6, and the minimum value is 0 at x = -π/6.Wait, but let me double-check. Since the function is 2 sin(2x + π/6) + 1, its range is from -1 to 3. However, in the given interval, the minimum is 0. Is that correct?Wait, when x = -π/6, f(x) = 0. Let me check another point to see if the function can go lower.Wait, let me compute f(-π/6 + h) for small h. For example, let me take x = -π/6 + π/12 = -π/12.Compute f(-π/12):f(-π/12) = 2 sin(2*(-π/12) + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(-π/6 + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(0) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1Hmm, so f(-π/12) = 1, which is higher than f(-π/6) = 0.Wait, maybe the function reaches its minimum at x = -π/6. Let me check another point, say x = -π/6 + π/24 = -5π/24.f(-5π/24) = 2 sin(2*(-5π/24) + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(-5π/12 + π/6) + 1 = 2 sin(-5π/12 + 2π/12) = 2 sin(-3π/12) = 2 sin(-π/4) = 2*(-√2/2) = -√2 ≈ -1.414Wait, but that would be lower than 0, but wait, is x = -5π/24 within the interval [-π/6, π/4]?Compute -5π/24 ≈ -0.654, and -π/6 ≈ -0.523. So, -5π/24 is less than -π/6, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, within the interval, the lowest point is at x = -π/6, which is 0.Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. The function f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6) + 1. The sine function can go as low as -1, so f(x) can go as low as -2 + 1 = -1. However, in the interval [-π/6, π/4], does the function actually reach -1?We found that at x = -π/6, f(x) = 0. Let me see if there's another critical point within the interval where f(x) could be lower.Wait, we only found one critical point at x = π/6, which is a maximum. So, perhaps the function doesn't reach its global minimum within the interval. The minimum within the interval is at the left endpoint, x = -π/6, which is 0.Wait, but when I plugged in x = -π/12, I got f(x) = 1, which is higher than 0. So, it seems that the function is increasing from x = -π/6 to x = π/6, reaching the maximum at π/6, then decreasing towards x = π/4.Wait, let me compute f(0):f(0) = 2 sin(0 + π/6) + 1 = 2*(1/2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2So, f(0) = 2, which is between 0 and 3.So, the function starts at 0 when x = -π/6, increases to 3 at x = π/6, then decreases to approximately 2.732 at x = π/4.Therefore, the minimum value is 0, and the maximum is 3.Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm by analyzing the function's behavior.Given f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6) + 1.The argument of the sine function is 2x + π/6. Let's see over the interval x ∈ [-π/6, π/4], what is the range of the argument?Compute when x = -π/6: 2*(-π/6) + π/6 = -π/3 + π/6 = -π/6When x = π/4: 2*(π/4) + π/6 = π/2 + π/6 = 2π/3So, the argument of sine goes from -π/6 to 2π/3.So, sin(θ) where θ ∈ [-π/6, 2π/3].The sine function reaches its minimum at θ = -π/6 and maximum at θ = π/2.So, sin(-π/6) = -1/2, sin(π/2) = 1, and sin(2π/3) = √3/2.Therefore, the minimum value of sin(θ) in this interval is -1/2, and the maximum is 1.Therefore, f(x) = 2 sin(θ) + 1 will have minimum value 2*(-1/2) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0, and maximum value 2*1 + 1 = 3.So, the minimum is 0, achieved when θ = -π/6, which corresponds to x = -π/6, and the maximum is 3, achieved when θ = π/2, which corresponds to x = π/6.Thus, within the interval, the function reaches its minimum at x = -π/6 and maximum at x = π/6.Therefore, the maximum value is 3, and the minimum value is 0.So, summarizing:(1) The axis of symmetry is x = π/6.(2) The maximum value is 3, and the minimum value is 0 in the interval [-π/6, π/4].**Final Answer**(1) The axis of symmetry is boxed{x = dfrac{pi}{6}}.(2) The maximum value is boxed{3} and the minimum value is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Given the real numbers x and y that satisfy the system of inequalities begin{cases} y leqslant 2x  x - 2y - 4 leqslant 0  y leqslant 4 - x end{cases}, find the maximum value of z = 2x + y.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of z = 2x + y, given that x and y are real numbers satisfying a system of inequalities. The system is:1. y ≤ 2x2. x - 2y - 4 ≤ 03. y ≤ 4 - xHmm, I think I remember that when dealing with systems of inequalities, the solution set is a region in the xy-plane, and to find the maximum or minimum of a linear function like z = 2x + y, I should look at the vertices of this region. That's because the maximum or minimum of a linear function over a convex polygon occurs at one of the vertices. So, my plan is to graph these inequalities, find the vertices of the feasible region, and then evaluate z at each vertex to find the maximum.First, let me write down the inequalities again to make sure I have them right:1. y ≤ 2x2. x - 2y - 4 ≤ 0, which can be rewritten as x - 2y ≤ 4, or maybe rearranged to y ≥ (x - 4)/23. y ≤ 4 - xSo, the first inequality is a line y = 2x, and the region below it. The second inequality, when rearranged, is y ≥ (x - 4)/2, which is a line with a slope of 1/2 and y-intercept at -2. The region above this line. The third inequality is y ≤ 4 - x, which is a line with a slope of -1 and y-intercept at 4, and the region below it.I think I should graph these lines to visualize the feasible region.Starting with y = 2x. It's a straight line passing through the origin with a steep slope. The region y ≤ 2x is all the points below this line.Next, y = (x - 4)/2. Let me rewrite that as y = (1/2)x - 2. So, it's a line with a gentle slope, starting at (0, -2). The inequality is y ≥ (1/2)x - 2, so the region above this line.Third, y = 4 - x. This is a line with a negative slope, starting at (0,4). The inequality is y ≤ 4 - x, so the region below this line.Now, I need to find the intersection points of these lines because those will be the vertices of the feasible region.First, let's find where y = 2x intersects y = (1/2)x - 2.Set 2x = (1/2)x - 2.Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:4x = x - 4Subtract x from both sides:3x = -4So, x = -4/3.Then, y = 2x = 2*(-4/3) = -8/3.So, one vertex is at (-4/3, -8/3).Next, find where y = 2x intersects y = 4 - x.Set 2x = 4 - x.Add x to both sides:3x = 4x = 4/3Then, y = 2*(4/3) = 8/3.So, another vertex is at (4/3, 8/3).Now, find where y = (1/2)x - 2 intersects y = 4 - x.Set (1/2)x - 2 = 4 - x.Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:x - 4 = 8 - 2xAdd 2x to both sides:3x - 4 = 8Add 4 to both sides:3x = 12x = 4Then, y = 4 - x = 4 - 4 = 0.So, the third vertex is at (4, 0).Wait, let me check that. If x = 4, then y = 4 - 4 = 0. Also, plugging into y = (1/2)x - 2: y = (1/2)*4 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0. So, yes, that's correct.Now, I should also check if these lines intersect the axes or if there are other intersection points. For example, y = 4 - x intersects the y-axis at (0,4) and the x-axis at (4,0). Similarly, y = 2x passes through the origin, and y = (1/2)x - 2 crosses the y-axis at (0, -2) and the x-axis at (4,0). Hmm, interesting, so both y = 4 - x and y = (1/2)x - 2 pass through (4,0). So, that's why their intersection is at (4,0).Wait, so the feasible region is bounded by these three lines. Let me try to visualize it.The region is where y ≤ 2x, y ≥ (1/2)x - 2, and y ≤ 4 - x. So, it's the area that is below y = 2x, above y = (1/2)x - 2, and below y = 4 - x.So, the vertices are the points where these lines intersect each other, which we found as (-4/3, -8/3), (4/3, 8/3), and (4, 0). Wait, but is that all? Or is there another vertex?Wait, when I think about the feasible region, it's a polygon bounded by these three lines. So, each pair of lines intersects at a vertex, so that's three vertices. So, the feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (-4/3, -8/3), (4/3, 8/3), and (4, 0).Wait, but let me double-check if all these points satisfy all the inequalities.For (-4/3, -8/3):1. y = -8/3 ≤ 2x = 2*(-4/3) = -8/3. So, equality holds, which is okay.2. x - 2y - 4 = (-4/3) - 2*(-8/3) - 4 = (-4/3) + 16/3 - 4 = (12/3) - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0 ≤ 0. So, equality holds.3. y = -8/3 ≤ 4 - x = 4 - (-4/3) = 4 + 4/3 = 16/3. So, -8/3 ≤ 16/3, which is true.So, that point is valid.For (4/3, 8/3):1. y = 8/3 ≤ 2x = 8/3. Equality holds.2. x - 2y - 4 = (4/3) - 2*(8/3) - 4 = (4/3) - 16/3 - 4 = (-12/3) - 4 = -4 - 4 = -8 ≤ 0. True.3. y = 8/3 ≤ 4 - x = 4 - 4/3 = 8/3. Equality holds.So, that point is valid.For (4, 0):1. y = 0 ≤ 2x = 8. True.2. x - 2y - 4 = 4 - 0 - 4 = 0 ≤ 0. Equality holds.3. y = 0 ≤ 4 - x = 0. Equality holds.So, that point is also valid.So, the feasible region is indeed a triangle with these three vertices.Now, to find the maximum of z = 2x + y, I need to evaluate z at each of these vertices.Let's compute z at each point:1. At (-4/3, -8/3):z = 2*(-4/3) + (-8/3) = (-8/3) + (-8/3) = (-16)/3 ≈ -5.3332. At (4/3, 8/3):z = 2*(4/3) + (8/3) = (8/3) + (8/3) = 16/3 ≈ 5.3333. At (4, 0):z = 2*4 + 0 = 8 + 0 = 8So, comparing these values: -16/3, 16/3, and 8. Clearly, 8 is the largest value.Therefore, the maximum value of z is 8, achieved at the point (4, 0).Wait a second, but let me make sure there are no other points on the edges or something that could give a higher z. But since z is linear, its maximum must occur at a vertex, so I think I'm safe.But just to double-check, let me consider each edge of the feasible region and see if z can be higher somewhere else.First, the edge from (-4/3, -8/3) to (4/3, 8/3). The equation of this edge is y = 2x, since both points lie on y = 2x.So, on this edge, z = 2x + y = 2x + 2x = 4x. So, as x increases, z increases. The maximum x on this edge is at (4/3, 8/3), which gives z = 16/3 ≈ 5.333, which is less than 8.Next, the edge from (4/3, 8/3) to (4, 0). Let me find the equation of this line.The two points are (4/3, 8/3) and (4, 0). The slope is (0 - 8/3)/(4 - 4/3) = (-8/3)/(8/3) = -1.So, the equation is y - 8/3 = -1(x - 4/3). Simplify:y = -x + 4/3 + 8/3 = -x + 12/3 = -x + 4.So, on this edge, y = -x + 4.So, z = 2x + y = 2x + (-x + 4) = x + 4.So, as x increases, z increases. The maximum x on this edge is at (4, 0), giving z = 4 + 4 = 8.So, that's consistent with our earlier result.Finally, the edge from (4, 0) to (-4/3, -8/3). Let me find the equation of this line.The two points are (4, 0) and (-4/3, -8/3). The slope is (-8/3 - 0)/(-4/3 - 4) = (-8/3)/(-16/3) = 0.5.So, the equation is y - 0 = 0.5(x - 4). So, y = 0.5x - 2.So, on this edge, z = 2x + y = 2x + 0.5x - 2 = 2.5x - 2.As x increases, z increases. The maximum x on this edge is at (4, 0), giving z = 2.5*4 - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8. Again, same result.So, all edges lead to the conclusion that the maximum z is 8 at (4, 0).Just to be thorough, let me also check if the feasible region is indeed bounded. Since all the inequalities are linear and we have three intersecting lines, the feasible region is a triangle, which is a bounded polygon. So, it must have a maximum and a minimum for any linear function over it.Therefore, I can confidently say that the maximum value of z = 2x + y is 8, achieved at the point (4, 0).**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( z ) is boxed{8}."},{"question":"Find all polynomials (P(x)) that satisfy the equation ( xP(x-1) equiv (x-2)P(x) ) for all (x in mathbf{R}).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all polynomials ( P(x) ) that satisfy the equation ( xP(x-1) equiv (x-2)P(x) ) for all real numbers ( x ). Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that ( P(x) ) is a polynomial, so it has a certain degree, say ( n ). Maybe I can figure out what ( n ) is. Let me think about the degrees of both sides of the equation.On the left side, we have ( xP(x-1) ). Since ( P(x-1) ) is just a shifted version of ( P(x) ), it still has degree ( n ). Multiplying by ( x ) increases the degree by 1, so the left side has degree ( n + 1 ).On the right side, we have ( (x - 2)P(x) ). Similarly, ( P(x) ) is degree ( n ), and multiplying by ( (x - 2) ) also increases the degree by 1, so the right side is also degree ( n + 1 ). Okay, so the degrees on both sides match, which is a good start.Now, maybe I can look at the leading coefficients to find some relationship. Let's denote the leading term of ( P(x) ) as ( a_n x^n ). Then, the leading term of ( P(x - 1) ) would be ( a_n (x - 1)^n ). Expanding ( (x - 1)^n ) gives ( x^n - n x^{n - 1} + dots ), but the leading term is still ( x^n ).So, the leading term of the left side ( xP(x - 1) ) would be ( x times a_n x^n = a_n x^{n + 1} ).On the right side, ( (x - 2)P(x) ) has a leading term of ( (x) times a_n x^n = a_n x^{n + 1} ). So, the leading coefficients on both sides are equal, which doesn't give me any new information. Hmm, maybe I need to look at the next term.Let me consider the next term in the expansion. For the left side, ( xP(x - 1) ), the next term after ( a_n x^{n + 1} ) would come from ( x times (-n a_n x^{n - 1}) ), which is ( -n a_n x^n ).For the right side, ( (x - 2)P(x) ), the next term after ( a_n x^{n + 1} ) comes from ( (x - 2) times a_n x^n ). That would be ( a_n x^{n + 1} - 2 a_n x^n ). So, the coefficient of ( x^n ) on the right side is ( -2 a_n ).Setting the coefficients of ( x^n ) equal from both sides, we have:Left side: ( -n a_n )Right side: ( -2 a_n )So, ( -n a_n = -2 a_n ). Simplifying, we get ( n a_n = 2 a_n ). Assuming ( a_n neq 0 ) (since it's the leading coefficient), we can divide both sides by ( a_n ) to get ( n = 2 ).So, the polynomial ( P(x) ) must be of degree 2. That narrows it down a bit. Let me write ( P(x) ) as a general quadratic polynomial:( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), where ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are constants to be determined.Now, let's compute both sides of the equation ( xP(x - 1) ) and ( (x - 2)P(x) ) and set them equal.First, compute ( P(x - 1) ):( P(x - 1) = a(x - 1)^2 + b(x - 1) + c )Expanding this:( a(x^2 - 2x + 1) + b(x - 1) + c = a x^2 - 2a x + a + b x - b + c )Combine like terms:( a x^2 + (-2a + b) x + (a - b + c) )Now, multiply by ( x ) to get ( xP(x - 1) ):( x times [a x^2 + (-2a + b) x + (a - b + c)] )Which is:( a x^3 + (-2a + b) x^2 + (a - b + c) x )On the other side, compute ( (x - 2)P(x) ):( (x - 2)(a x^2 + b x + c) )Multiply this out:( x(a x^2 + b x + c) - 2(a x^2 + b x + c) )Which is:( a x^3 + b x^2 + c x - 2a x^2 - 2b x - 2c )Combine like terms:( a x^3 + (b - 2a) x^2 + (c - 2b) x - 2c )Now, set ( xP(x - 1) ) equal to ( (x - 2)P(x) ):Left side: ( a x^3 + (-2a + b) x^2 + (a - b + c) x )Right side: ( a x^3 + (b - 2a) x^2 + (c - 2b) x - 2c )Since these polynomials are equal for all ( x ), their corresponding coefficients must be equal.Let's equate the coefficients term by term.1. Coefficient of ( x^3 ):Left: ( a )Right: ( a )So, ( a = a ). No new information here.2. Coefficient of ( x^2 ):Left: ( -2a + b )Right: ( b - 2a )So, ( -2a + b = b - 2a ). Again, this simplifies to ( 0 = 0 ). No new info.3. Coefficient of ( x ):Left: ( a - b + c )Right: ( c - 2b )So, ( a - b + c = c - 2b )Simplify: Subtract ( c ) from both sides: ( a - b = -2b )Then, ( a = -2b + b = -b )So, ( a = -b )4. Constant term:Left side has no constant term, so coefficient is 0.Right side: ( -2c )Therefore, ( 0 = -2c )Which implies ( c = 0 )So, from the constant term, we have ( c = 0 ). From the coefficient of ( x ), we have ( a = -b ).So, now, let's write ( P(x) ) in terms of ( b ):( P(x) = a x^2 + b x + c = (-b) x^2 + b x + 0 = -b x^2 + b x )Factor out ( b ):( P(x) = b(-x^2 + x) = b x (1 - x) )So, ( P(x) ) is a multiple of ( x(1 - x) ). Let me check if this works.Let me take ( P(x) = k x (1 - x) ) where ( k ) is a constant. Let's plug this into the original equation.Compute ( x P(x - 1) ):( x times k (x - 1)(1 - (x - 1)) )Simplify inside the parentheses:( (x - 1)(1 - x + 1) = (x - 1)(2 - x) )So, ( x P(x - 1) = k x (x - 1)(2 - x) )Compute ( (x - 2) P(x) ):( (x - 2) times k x (1 - x) )Which is ( k x (x - 2)(1 - x) )Notice that ( (x - 2)(1 - x) = -(x - 2)(x - 1) = -(x - 1)(x - 2) )So, ( (x - 2) P(x) = -k x (x - 1)(x - 2) )Wait, but ( x P(x - 1) = k x (x - 1)(2 - x) = -k x (x - 1)(x - 2) ). So, both sides are equal:( x P(x - 1) = -k x (x - 1)(x - 2) )( (x - 2) P(x) = -k x (x - 1)(x - 2) )Therefore, they are equal. So, ( P(x) = k x (1 - x) ) satisfies the equation for any constant ( k ).But wait, let me check if there are any other possibilities. Earlier, I assumed that ( P(x) ) is a quadratic polynomial because the degrees on both sides matched when ( n = 2 ). But is that the only possibility?Wait, suppose ( P(x) ) is the zero polynomial. Then both sides would be zero, so that works. So, ( P(x) = 0 ) is also a solution.But in my earlier steps, I considered ( P(x) ) as a quadratic, but if ( P(x) ) is the zero polynomial, it's technically a polynomial of degree negative infinity or something, but it's a valid solution.So, combining these, the general solution is ( P(x) = k x (1 - x) ) where ( k ) is any constant, including zero.Wait, but let me verify if there are any other solutions. Suppose ( P(x) ) is a higher degree polynomial. Let me test with ( P(x) ) of degree 3.Suppose ( P(x) = a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d ). Then, ( P(x - 1) = a (x - 1)^3 + b (x - 1)^2 + c (x - 1) + d ). Multiplying by ( x ) would give a degree 4 polynomial. On the other side, ( (x - 2) P(x) ) would also be degree 4. But earlier, when I equated the coefficients, I found that the degree had to be 2. So, maybe higher degrees aren't possible?Wait, let me think again. When I equated the coefficients, I assumed that ( P(x) ) was degree 2, but actually, if ( P(x) ) is of higher degree, say ( n ), then both sides have degree ( n + 1 ), so the leading coefficients must satisfy ( a_n = a_n ), which is always true, but the next term gives ( -n a_n = -2 a_n ), leading to ( n = 2 ). So, that suggests that the degree must be exactly 2, otherwise, the equation ( n = 2 ) would not hold.Therefore, the only solutions are quadratic polynomials of the form ( P(x) = k x (1 - x) ), including the zero polynomial.Wait, but let me test with ( P(x) = 0 ). Plugging into the equation, we get ( x times 0 = (x - 2) times 0 ), which is ( 0 = 0 ). So, that works.So, in conclusion, all polynomials satisfying the equation are scalar multiples of ( x(1 - x) ), including the zero polynomial. So, the general solution is ( P(x) = k x (1 - x) ) where ( k ) is a constant.Let me just double-check by plugging in a specific value. Let me choose ( x = 1 ).Left side: ( 1 times P(0) = P(0) )Right side: ( (1 - 2) P(1) = (-1) P(1) )So, ( P(0) = -P(1) ). Let's see if this holds for ( P(x) = k x (1 - x) ).Compute ( P(0) = k times 0 times (1 - 0) = 0 )Compute ( P(1) = k times 1 times (1 - 1) = 0 )So, ( P(0) = 0 = -0 = -P(1) ). So, that works.Another test: ( x = 2 )Left side: ( 2 times P(1) = 2 times 0 = 0 )Right side: ( (2 - 2) P(2) = 0 times P(2) = 0 )So, both sides are 0. That works.Another test: ( x = 3 )Left side: ( 3 times P(2) = 3 times k times 2 times (1 - 2) = 3 times k times 2 times (-1) = -6k )Right side: ( (3 - 2) P(3) = 1 times k times 3 times (1 - 3) = 1 times k times 3 times (-2) = -6k )So, both sides equal. That works too.Okay, seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that all solutions are of the form ( P(x) = k x (1 - x) ), where ( k ) is a constant.**Final Answer**The polynomials satisfying the equation are all constant multiples of ( x(1 - x) ). Thus, the solution is (boxed{P(x) = kx(1 - x)}) where ( k ) is a constant.**Final Answer**The polynomials are all scalar multiples of (x(1 - x)). Thus, the solution is (boxed{P(x) = kx(1 - x)}) where (k) is a constant."},{"question":"The \\"Stacked Multiplication\\" problem in the important work \\"Detailed Explanation of the Nine Chapters Algorithm\\" by the mathematician Yang Hui of the Southern Song Dynasty introduces high-order arithmetic sequences. Taking the second-order arithmetic sequence in the high-order arithmetic sequence as an example, its characteristic is that starting from the second term in the sequence, the difference between each term and the previous term forms an arithmetic sequence. If the first 4 terms of a second-order arithmetic sequence are 2, 3, 6, 11, then the 15th term of this sequence is ( )A: 196B: 197C: 198D: 199","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a second-order arithmetic sequence. The first four terms are given: 2, 3, 6, 11. I need to find the 15th term. Hmm, okay, let me think about what a second-order arithmetic sequence is.From the problem statement, it says that starting from the second term, the difference between each term and the previous term forms an arithmetic sequence. So, that means if I take the differences between consecutive terms, those differences themselves form an arithmetic sequence.Let me write down the given terms:Term 1: 2Term 2: 3Term 3: 6Term 4: 11Okay, so let's compute the first differences (the differences between consecutive terms):Difference between Term 2 and Term 1: 3 - 2 = 1Difference between Term 3 and Term 2: 6 - 3 = 3Difference between Term 4 and Term 3: 11 - 6 = 5So, the first differences are 1, 3, 5. Hmm, that looks like an arithmetic sequence itself because 3 - 1 = 2 and 5 - 3 = 2. So, the common difference here is 2.Since it's a second-order arithmetic sequence, the first differences form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. That means the next difference after 5 would be 5 + 2 = 7, right? So, the differences would continue as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and so on.Therefore, to find the next terms, I can keep adding these differences to the previous term. Let me try to compute the next few terms to see the pattern.Term 5: Term 4 + 7 = 11 + 7 = 18Term 6: Term 5 + 9 = 18 + 9 = 27Term 7: Term 6 + 11 = 27 + 11 = 38Term 8: Term 7 + 13 = 38 + 13 = 51Term 9: Term 8 + 15 = 51 + 15 = 66Term 10: Term 9 + 17 = 66 + 17 = 83Term 11: Term 10 + 19 = 83 + 19 = 102Term 12: Term 11 + 21 = 102 + 21 = 123Term 13: Term 12 + 23 = 123 + 23 = 146Term 14: Term 13 + 25 = 146 + 25 = 171Term 15: Term 14 + 27 = 171 + 27 = 198Wait, so according to this, the 15th term is 198. Hmm, but let me verify if this is correct because I might have made a mistake in adding somewhere.Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for the nth term of this second-order arithmetic sequence. Since the first differences form an arithmetic sequence, I can model the nth term using a quadratic function. Because in a second-order arithmetic sequence, the nth term is a quadratic function of n.Let me recall that for a second-order arithmetic sequence, the nth term can be expressed as:a_n = An² + Bn + CWhere A, B, and C are constants that we need to determine.Given that, let's plug in the known terms to find A, B, and C.For n = 1: a_1 = A(1)² + B(1) + C = A + B + C = 2For n = 2: a_2 = A(2)² + B(2) + C = 4A + 2B + C = 3For n = 3: a_3 = A(3)² + B(3) + C = 9A + 3B + C = 6So, now we have a system of three equations:1) A + B + C = 22) 4A + 2B + C = 33) 9A + 3B + C = 6Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:(4A + 2B + C) - (A + B + C) = 3 - 2Which simplifies to:3A + B = 1  --> Equation 4Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:(9A + 3B + C) - (4A + 2B + C) = 6 - 3Which simplifies to:5A + B = 3  --> Equation 5Now, subtract equation 4 from equation 5:(5A + B) - (3A + B) = 3 - 1Which simplifies to:2A = 2 => A = 1Now, plug A = 1 into equation 4:3(1) + B = 1 => 3 + B = 1 => B = -2Now, plug A = 1 and B = -2 into equation 1:1 + (-2) + C = 2 => -1 + C = 2 => C = 3So, the general formula for the nth term is:a_n = n² - 2n + 3Let me verify this with the given terms:For n=1: 1 - 2 + 3 = 2 ✔️For n=2: 4 - 4 + 3 = 3 ✔️For n=3: 9 - 6 + 3 = 6 ✔️For n=4: 16 - 8 + 3 = 11 ✔️Great, that works. So, now, to find the 15th term, plug n=15 into the formula:a_15 = (15)² - 2(15) + 3 = 225 - 30 + 3 = 198Hmm, so that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the 15th term is 198.Wait, but let me check my initial differences method again because when I added up the differences, I got 198 as well. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since the first differences form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2, the nth term can be expressed as a quadratic function, which we already did.But just to make sure, let me compute the differences again step by step:Given the first four terms: 2, 3, 6, 11Differences: 1, 3, 5So, the differences are increasing by 2 each time. So, the next differences would be 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27.So, starting from term 4 (which is 11), adding 7 gives term 5: 18Term 5: 18Term 6: 18 + 9 = 27Term 7: 27 + 11 = 38Term 8: 38 + 13 = 51Term 9: 51 + 15 = 66Term 10: 66 + 17 = 83Term 11: 83 + 19 = 102Term 12: 102 + 21 = 123Term 13: 123 + 23 = 146Term 14: 146 + 25 = 171Term 15: 171 + 27 = 198Yep, same result. So, that's consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the nth term of a second-order arithmetic sequence. Since the first differences form an arithmetic sequence with first term d1 = 1 and common difference 2, the kth difference is d_k = 1 + (k-1)*2 = 2k -1.Therefore, the nth term can be expressed as the sum of the initial term plus the sum of the first (n-1) differences.So, a_n = a_1 + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} d_kGiven that a_1 = 2, and d_k = 2k -1.So, sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (2k -1) = 2 * sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k - sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1We know that sum_{k=1}^{m} k = m(m+1)/2, and sum_{k=1}^{m} 1 = m.So, substituting m = n -1:sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (2k -1) = 2*( (n-1)n / 2 ) - (n -1) = (n-1)n - (n -1) = (n -1)(n -1) = (n -1)^2Therefore, a_n = 2 + (n -1)^2Wait, that's a simpler expression. Let me check that.For n=1: 2 + (0)^2 = 2 ✔️For n=2: 2 + (1)^2 = 3 ✔️For n=3: 2 + (2)^2 = 6 ✔️For n=4: 2 + (3)^2 = 11 ✔️Perfect, so the nth term is a_n = 2 + (n -1)^2.Therefore, the 15th term is:a_15 = 2 + (15 -1)^2 = 2 + (14)^2 = 2 + 196 = 198So, that's another way to get the same result. So, definitely, the 15th term is 198.Wait, but hold on, the options given are A:196, B:197, C:198, D:199. So, 198 is option C. So, the answer should be C:198.But just to make sure, let me compute a few more terms using the formula a_n = 2 + (n -1)^2.Term 5: 2 + (4)^2 = 2 + 16 = 18 ✔️Term 6: 2 + (5)^2 = 2 + 25 = 27 ✔️Term 7: 2 + (6)^2 = 2 + 36 = 38 ✔️Term 8: 2 + (7)^2 = 2 + 49 = 51 ✔️Term 9: 2 + (8)^2 = 2 + 64 = 66 ✔️Term 10: 2 + (9)^2 = 2 + 81 = 83 ✔️Term 11: 2 + (10)^2 = 2 + 100 = 102 ✔️Term 12: 2 + (11)^2 = 2 + 121 = 123 ✔️Term 13: 2 + (12)^2 = 2 + 144 = 146 ✔️Term 14: 2 + (13)^2 = 2 + 169 = 171 ✔️Term 15: 2 + (14)^2 = 2 + 196 = 198 ✔️Yes, everything checks out. So, the 15th term is indeed 198, which is option C.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that in a second-order arithmetic sequence, the nth term can be expressed as a quadratic function. Since the first differences are linear, the nth term is quadratic. We found that a_n = n² - 2n + 3, which simplifies to (n -1)^2 + 2, which is the same as 2 + (n -1)^2. So, both approaches lead to the same formula.Therefore, I'm confident that the 15th term is 198, which is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Consider an arithmetic sequence {a_n} satisfying a_1 = 1 and a_n > 0 for n in mathbb{N}^*. Let S_n denote the sum of the first n terms. If the sequence {sqrt{S_n}} is also an arithmetic sequence, determine the maximum value of frac{S_{n+10}}{a_n^2}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, the problem says: Consider an arithmetic sequence {a_n} with a_1 = 1 and a_n > 0 for all natural numbers n. S_n is the sum of the first n terms. It also mentions that the sequence {sqrt(S_n)} is an arithmetic sequence. We need to find the maximum value of S_{n+10} divided by a_n squared.Okay, let's start by recalling what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, if {a_n} is arithmetic, then a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where d is the common difference.Given that a_1 = 1, so the general term is a_n = 1 + (n-1)d. Also, since a_n > 0 for all n, we must have that 1 + (n-1)d > 0 for all n. Since n can be any positive integer, the smallest term is a_1 = 1, and as n increases, the terms increase if d > 0 or decrease if d < 0. But since a_n must stay positive, if d is negative, we have to ensure that 1 + (n-1)d > 0 for all n. However, if d is negative, eventually for some large n, the term a_n would become negative, which contradicts the condition a_n > 0. Therefore, d must be non-negative. So, d >= 0.Now, S_n is the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n-1)d). Plugging in a_1 = 1, we get S_n = n/2 * (2 + (n-1)d) = n(1 + (n-1)d/2).The problem states that {sqrt(S_n)} is also an arithmetic sequence. Let me denote b_n = sqrt(S_n). Then, {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence. So, b_n = b_1 + (n-1)k, where k is the common difference of the new sequence.Since b_n = sqrt(S_n), we have sqrt(S_n) = b_1 + (n-1)k. Let's square both sides to get S_n = (b_1 + (n-1)k)^2.But we also have S_n = n(1 + (n-1)d/2). Therefore, equating the two expressions:n(1 + (n-1)d/2) = (b_1 + (n-1)k)^2.Let me expand both sides to see if I can find expressions for d and k.First, the left side:n(1 + (n-1)d/2) = n + (n(n-1)d)/2.The right side:(b_1 + (n-1)k)^2 = b_1^2 + 2b_1(n-1)k + (n-1)^2k^2.So, equating the two:n + (n(n-1)d)/2 = b_1^2 + 2b_1(n-1)k + (n-1)^2k^2.Hmm, this is a quadratic in n on both sides. Let me rearrange the equation:Left side: (d/2)n^2 + (1 - d/2)n.Right side: (k^2)n^2 + (-2k^2 + 2b_1k)n + (b_1^2 - 2b_1k + k^2).Wait, hold on, let me compute the right side step by step.Right side: (b_1 + (n-1)k)^2 = b_1^2 + 2b_1k(n - 1) + k^2(n - 1)^2.Expanding that:= b_1^2 + 2b_1kn - 2b_1k + k^2(n^2 - 2n + 1)= b_1^2 - 2b_1k + 2b_1kn + k^2n^2 - 2k^2n + k^2.So, grouping terms:= k^2n^2 + (2b_1k - 2k^2)n + (b_1^2 - 2b_1k + k^2).Therefore, the right side is:k^2n^2 + (2b_1k - 2k^2)n + (b_1^2 - 2b_1k + k^2).The left side is:(d/2)n^2 + (1 - d/2)n.So, equating coefficients for each power of n:For n^2: d/2 = k^2.For n: 1 - d/2 = 2b_1k - 2k^2.For the constant term: 0 = b_1^2 - 2b_1k + k^2.Wait, the left side has no constant term, so the constant term on the right must be zero.So, we have three equations:1. d/2 = k^2.2. 1 - d/2 = 2b_1k - 2k^2.3. b_1^2 - 2b_1k + k^2 = 0.Let me solve these equations step by step.Starting with equation 3: b_1^2 - 2b_1k + k^2 = 0.This is a quadratic in b_1: (b_1 - k)^2 = 0. So, b_1 = k.Therefore, b_1 = k.Now, let's substitute b_1 = k into equation 2.Equation 2: 1 - d/2 = 2b_1k - 2k^2.But since b_1 = k, this becomes:1 - d/2 = 2k^2 - 2k^2 = 0.So, 1 - d/2 = 0 => d/2 = 1 => d = 2.From equation 1: d/2 = k^2. Since d = 2, we have 2/2 = k^2 => k^2 = 1 => k = 1 or k = -1.But since S_n is the sum of positive terms, sqrt(S_n) must be positive, so b_n = sqrt(S_n) is positive. Therefore, b_1 = sqrt(S_1) = sqrt(a_1) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, b_1 = 1. But earlier, we found that b_1 = k. So, k = 1.Therefore, k = 1, d = 2.So, now, we have the arithmetic sequence {a_n} with a_1 = 1 and common difference d = 2. Therefore, a_n = 1 + (n - 1)*2 = 2n - 1.Let me verify that {sqrt(S_n)} is indeed an arithmetic sequence.First, compute S_n.S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n - 1)d) = n/2 * (2*1 + (n - 1)*2) = n/2 * (2 + 2n - 2) = n/2 * (2n) = n^2.So, S_n = n^2, which means sqrt(S_n) = n, which is indeed an arithmetic sequence with common difference 1. Perfect, that checks out.So, now, we need to find the maximum value of S_{n+10} / (a_n)^2.First, let's compute S_{n+10} and a_n.We have S_n = n^2, so S_{n+10} = (n + 10)^2.And a_n = 2n - 1.Therefore, the expression is:S_{n+10} / (a_n)^2 = (n + 10)^2 / (2n - 1)^2.We need to find the maximum value of this expression as n varies over positive integers.Wait, but hold on, n is a positive integer, so n >= 1. Also, since a_n > 0, 2n - 1 > 0 => n >= 1, which is already satisfied.So, we need to find the maximum of f(n) = (n + 10)^2 / (2n - 1)^2 for n in natural numbers.Hmm, to find the maximum, perhaps we can consider f(n) as a function of a real variable n and find its maximum, then check the nearby integers.Let me set f(n) = (n + 10)^2 / (2n - 1)^2.Let me compute the derivative of f(n) with respect to n to find its critical points.First, let me write f(n) as [(n + 10)/(2n - 1)]^2.Let me denote g(n) = (n + 10)/(2n - 1). Then f(n) = [g(n)]^2.Compute derivative f’(n) = 2g(n) * g’(n).Compute g’(n):g(n) = (n + 10)/(2n - 1).g’(n) = [ (1)(2n - 1) - (n + 10)(2) ] / (2n - 1)^2= [ (2n - 1) - 2(n + 10) ] / (2n - 1)^2= [2n - 1 - 2n - 20] / (2n - 1)^2= (-21) / (2n - 1)^2.Therefore, f’(n) = 2 * [(n + 10)/(2n - 1)] * [ -21 / (2n - 1)^2 ] = -42(n + 10)/(2n - 1)^3.Set f’(n) = 0:-42(n + 10)/(2n - 1)^3 = 0.The numerator is -42(n + 10). Since n >= 1, n + 10 > 0, so the numerator is never zero. Therefore, f(n) has no critical points where the derivative is zero. The derivative is always negative because -42(n + 10) is negative and (2n - 1)^3 is positive for n >= 1. Therefore, f(n) is strictly decreasing for n >= 1.Therefore, the maximum value of f(n) occurs at the smallest possible n, which is n = 1.Compute f(1):f(1) = (1 + 10)^2 / (2*1 - 1)^2 = (11)^2 / (1)^2 = 121 / 1 = 121.Now, check n = 2:f(2) = (2 + 10)^2 / (4 - 1)^2 = 12^2 / 3^2 = 144 / 9 = 16.n = 3:f(3) = (13)^2 / (5)^2 = 169 / 25 = 6.76.n = 4:f(4) = (14)^2 / (7)^2 = 196 / 49 = 4.n = 5:f(5) = (15)^2 / (9)^2 = 225 / 81 ≈ 2.777...So, as n increases, f(n) decreases. Therefore, the maximum value is at n = 1, which is 121.But wait, let me check n = 1: a_1 = 1, S_{11} = (1 + 10)^2 = 121, so S_{11}/(a_1)^2 = 121 / 1 = 121. That seems correct.But the problem says \\"for n ∈ ℕ^*\\", which is the set of positive integers, so n = 1 is allowed.Therefore, the maximum value is 121.Wait, but let me double-check if n can be 1. The problem says \\"for n ∈ ℕ^*\\", which is typically the set {1, 2, 3, ...}, so yes, n = 1 is allowed.Therefore, the maximum value is 121.But just to make sure, let me see if the function f(n) can get larger for some n beyond 1, but since f(n) is strictly decreasing, it can't. So, 121 is indeed the maximum.**Final Answer**The maximum value is boxed{121}."},{"question":"A 40-bead necklace is made up of three kinds of beads.

The options are A: 5, B: 6, C: 7, D: 8. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I'll break down the expression into three separate parts to make it easier to handle. So, I have:1. (3^{1+log_{3}2})2. (log5)3. (log_{3}2 times log_{2}3 times log2)I'll tackle each part one by one.Starting with the first part: (3^{1+log_{3}2}). I remember that when you have an exponent with a logarithm in it, there are some properties you can use. Specifically, (a^{log_{a}b} = b). That might come in handy here.Let me rewrite the exponent (1 + log_{3}2) as (log_{3}3 + log_{3}2) because (log_{3}3 = 1). So, that becomes (log_{3}3 + log_{3}2). Using logarithm properties, (log_{a}b + log_{a}c = log_{a}(b times c)). So, this simplifies to (log_{3}(3 times 2) = log_{3}6).So now, the first part is (3^{log_{3}6}). Using the property I mentioned earlier, (a^{log_{a}b} = b), so this simplifies directly to 6. Okay, that wasn't too bad. So, the first part is 6.Moving on to the second part: (log5). Hmm, wait, is that base 10? The problem doesn't specify, but in math problems like this, if the base isn't specified, it's usually base 10. So, I'll assume it's (log_{10}5). I don't know the exact value, but I know it's approximately 0.69897. But maybe I don't need the exact value because the other parts might combine in a way that makes it cancel out or something. Let me see.Third part: (log_{3}2 times log_{2}3 times log2). Hmm, that's a product of three logarithms with different bases. Let me see if I can simplify this.First, I notice that (log_{3}2) and (log_{2}3) are reciprocals of each other. Because (log_{a}b = 1/log_{b}a). So, (log_{3}2 times log_{2}3 = 1). That's a useful property. So, that simplifies the third part to (1 times log2), which is just (log2). Again, assuming base 10 unless specified otherwise, so (log_{10}2), which is approximately 0.3010.So now, putting it all together:First part: 6Second part: (log5 approx 0.69897)Third part: (log2 approx 0.3010)So, adding them up: 6 + 0.69897 + 0.3010. Let me calculate that.0.69897 + 0.3010 is approximately 1. So, 6 + 1 = 7. Hmm, so the total is approximately 7. So, the answer should be C: 7.Wait, but let me double-check if I did everything correctly because sometimes these logarithmic properties can be tricky.Starting again with the first part: (3^{1+log_{3}2}). I converted 1 into (log_{3}3), so it becomes (3^{log_{3}3 + log_{3}2}). Then, using the property (a^{log_{a}b + log_{a}c} = a^{log_{a}(b times c)}), which is (3^{log_{3}6}), which is 6. That seems correct.Second part: (log5). If it's base 10, then it's approximately 0.69897. If it's natural log, it would be about 1.609, but the problem didn't specify. Hmm, wait, maybe I should check if the logs are all base 10 or if some are natural. The problem has logs with different bases: (log5) and (log2). It's possible that they are all base 10 unless specified otherwise.But wait, in the third part, we have (log_{3}2 times log_{2}3 times log2). The first two are base 3 and base 2, but the last one is just (log2), which is base 10. So, perhaps the second part (log5) is also base 10. So, I think my initial assumption was correct.So, if I add 6 + (log5) + (log2), that's 6 + ((log5 + log2)). Using logarithm properties, (log5 + log2 = log(5 times 2) = log10). Since it's base 10, (log10 = 1). So, that simplifies things! So, instead of approximating, it's exact.So, 6 + 1 = 7. So, the total is exactly 7. So, the answer is C: 7.Wait, that's a much cleaner way to do it. I should have thought of that earlier. Instead of approximating, recognizing that (log5 + log2 = log10 = 1). So, that makes the second and third parts add up to 1, and then adding that to 6 gives 7. That's much better.So, to recap:First part: (3^{1+log_{3}2} = 6)Second part: (log5)Third part: (log_{3}2 times log_{2}3 times log2 = log2)So, adding them: 6 + (log5 + log2) = 6 + (log10) = 6 + 1 = 7.Yep, that's solid. So, the answer is definitely 7, which is option C.I think that's thorough enough. I considered both the approximate and exact methods, and both lead to the same conclusion. So, I feel confident that C is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Given a sequence of complex numbers {a_n} with the general term:a_{n}=(1+i)left(1+frac{i}{sqrt{2}}right)left(1+frac{i}{sqrt{3}}right) cdotsleft(1+frac{i}{sqrt{n}}right)then left|a_{n}-a_{n+1}right|=A. frac{sqrt{2}}{2}B. sqrt{2}C. 1D. 2","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a sequence of complex numbers. The general term is given by:a_{n}=(1+i)left(1+frac{i}{sqrt{2}}right)left(1+frac{i}{sqrt{3}}right) cdotsleft(1+frac{i}{sqrt{n}}right)And the question is asking for the absolute difference between consecutive terms, specifically |a_n - a_{n+1}|, and then choose the correct option from A to D.First, let me try to understand what this sequence is. Each term a_n is a product of several complex numbers. The first term is (1+i), the next is (1 + i/sqrt{2}), then (1 + i/sqrt{3}), and so on up to (1 + i/sqrt{n}). So, each term is built by multiplying the previous term by the next factor in the sequence.So, a_{n+1} would be a_n multiplied by (1 + i/sqrt{n+1}). That is:a_{n+1} = a_n cdot left(1 + frac{i}{sqrt{n+1}}right)Therefore, the difference between a_{n+1} and a_n is:a_{n+1} - a_n = a_n cdot left(1 + frac{i}{sqrt{n+1}}right) - a_n = a_n cdot left( left(1 + frac{i}{sqrt{n+1}}right) - 1 right) = a_n cdot frac{i}{sqrt{n+1}}So, the difference is a_n cdot frac{i}{sqrt{n+1}}. Now, the question is about the absolute value of this difference, which is |a_n - a_{n+1}| = |a_n cdot frac{i}{sqrt{n+1}}|.Since the absolute value of a product is the product of the absolute values, this becomes:|a_n| cdot left| frac{i}{sqrt{n+1}} right| = |a_n| cdot frac{1}{sqrt{n+1}}Because |i| = 1, so that part is straightforward.Now, I need to find |a_n|. Since a_n is a product of complex numbers, its absolute value is the product of their absolute values. So,|a_n| = |1 + i| cdot left|1 + frac{i}{sqrt{2}}right| cdot left|1 + frac{i}{sqrt{3}}right| cdots left|1 + frac{i}{sqrt{n}}right|Let me compute each of these absolute values. For a complex number 1 + frac{i}{sqrt{k}}, the absolute value is:sqrt{1^2 + left( frac{1}{sqrt{k}} right)^2 } = sqrt{1 + frac{1}{k}} = sqrt{frac{k + 1}{k}} = frac{sqrt{k + 1}}{sqrt{k}}So, each term in the product for |a_n| is frac{sqrt{k + 1}}{sqrt{k}} where k goes from 1 to n.Therefore, the product becomes:|a_n| = prod_{k=1}^{n} frac{sqrt{k + 1}}{sqrt{k}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{1}} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{2}} cdot frac{sqrt{4}}{sqrt{3}} cdots frac{sqrt{n + 1}}{sqrt{n}}I notice that this is a telescoping product. Each numerator cancels with the denominator of the next term. So, all the intermediate terms cancel out, leaving only the first denominator and the last numerator.Therefore, |a_n| = frac{sqrt{n + 1}}{sqrt{1}} = sqrt{n + 1}.So, going back to the expression for |a_n - a_{n+1}|:|a_n - a_{n+1}| = |a_n| cdot frac{1}{sqrt{n + 1}} = sqrt{n + 1} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{n + 1}} = 1Wait, that simplifies to 1. So, regardless of the value of n, the absolute difference between consecutive terms is 1.Looking at the options, C is 1. So, the answer should be C.But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify each step.1. I expressed a_{n+1} as a_n times the next factor. That seems correct because each term is the product up to that point.2. Then, I found the difference a_{n+1} - a_n and factored out a_n, which gave me a_n cdot frac{i}{sqrt{n+1}}. That makes sense.3. Then, I took the absolute value, which is |a_n| cdot frac{1}{sqrt{n+1}}. Correct, since |i| = 1.4. Calculated |a_n| by multiplying the absolute values of each factor. Each term is sqrt{1 + 1/k}, which I correctly simplified to sqrt{(k + 1)/k}.5. Then, the product telescopes, leaving sqrt{n + 1}. That seems right.6. Finally, plugging back in, I get 1. So, yes, it's 1.Therefore, the answer is C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Given 4 propositions:(1) For any two lines in space, there exist infinitely many planes with equal angles formed with these two lines.(2) For any three pairwise skew lines in space, there exist infinitely many lines that intersect all three.(3) For any four pairwise skew lines in space, there is no line that intersects all four.(4) If three planes intersect pairwise, producing three non-coincident lines, then these three lines are concurrent. Identify the number of false propositions among these.A. 1 false propositionB. 2 false propositionsC. 3 false propositionsD. 4 false propositions","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem with four propositions about lines and planes in space, and I need to figure out how many of them are false. The options are A through D, with A being 1 false proposition and D being all four false. Let me go through each proposition one by one and analyze them.Starting with proposition (1): \\"For any two lines in space, there exist infinitely many planes with equal angles formed with these two lines.\\" Hmm, okay. So, if I have two lines in space, they can either be skew, parallel, or intersecting. If they're parallel, then any plane that contains both lines would make equal angles with them, but wait, if they're parallel, they lie in the same plane, right? So, actually, there's only one plane that contains both lines if they're parallel. But the proposition says \\"infinitely many planes.\\" Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about it wrong.Wait, maybe it's not about containing the lines, but about forming equal angles with them. So, if I have two lines, regardless of their position, can I find infinitely many planes such that each plane makes the same angle with both lines? Let me visualize this.Imagine two lines in space. If they're skew, which is the general case, then for each line, the angle between the plane and the line is determined by the angle between the line and the normal vector of the plane. So, if I want the plane to make equal angles with both lines, the normals of such planes must satisfy some condition relative to both lines.I think this is related to the concept of angle bisectors in three dimensions. In 3D, the set of planes that make equal angles with two lines would form a kind of ruled surface, maybe a hyperbolic paraboloid or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a double cone or something else. But regardless, the key point is whether there are infinitely many such planes.I think there are. Because for each direction, you can have a plane that tilts in such a way to make equal angles with both lines. So, even if the lines are skew, you can rotate around some axis and get different planes that satisfy the angle condition. So, I think proposition (1) is actually true. So, I don't think it's false.Moving on to proposition (2): \\"For any three pairwise skew lines in space, there exist infinitely many lines that intersect all three.\\" Hmm, okay. So, three skew lines. Each pair is skew, meaning they don't intersect and aren't parallel. So, can there be infinitely many lines that intersect all three?I remember something about this. In three-dimensional space, given three skew lines, the number of lines that intersect all three can vary. If the three skew lines are in what's called a \\"regulus\\" or something, then there might be infinitely many lines intersecting all three. But I think it depends on the configuration.Wait, actually, I think that for three skew lines, if they are part of a regulus, which is a set of lines that are all skew and lie on a hyperboloid, then there are infinitely many lines intersecting all three. But if the three skew lines are not part of a regulus, then there might be only finitely many such lines, maybe two.But the proposition says \\"for any three pairwise skew lines,\\" so regardless of their configuration, there exist infinitely many lines intersecting all three. I think that's not necessarily true. I think it's only true if the three lines lie on a hyperboloid, which is a doubly ruled surface. Otherwise, if they don't lie on such a surface, there might be only a finite number of transversals.So, for example, if I have three skew lines that are not on a hyperboloid, then the number of lines intersecting all three is finite, maybe two. So, the proposition is claiming that for any three skew lines, there are infinitely many lines intersecting all three, which is not always the case. So, proposition (2) is false.Okay, so that's one false proposition so far.Proposition (3): \\"For any four pairwise skew lines in space, there is no line that intersects all four.\\" Hmm. So, four skew lines, each pair is skew. Is there a line that intersects all four? The proposition says there isn't.I think this is related to the previous one. If three skew lines can sometimes have infinitely many lines intersecting them, but four skew lines... I think it's more restrictive. In general, four skew lines in space, is there a line that intersects all four? I think it's not possible, but I need to verify.Wait, in three-dimensional space, the maximum number of skew lines that can be mutually intersected by another line is three, right? Because if you have four skew lines, you can't have a single line intersecting all four. Because each intersection imposes a condition, and with four conditions, it's over-constrained.Alternatively, think about the degrees of freedom. A line in space has four degrees of freedom (two points, each with x, y, z, but with some constraints). Each intersection with a skew line imposes two conditions (the line must pass through a point on the skew line and have the correct direction). So, for four intersections, that's eight conditions, which is more than the four degrees of freedom, so it's impossible.Therefore, proposition (3) is true. So, no line can intersect all four pairwise skew lines. So, proposition (3) is true.Moving on to proposition (4): \\"If three planes intersect pairwise, producing three non-coincident lines, then these three lines are concurrent.\\" Hmm. So, three planes intersecting pairwise, each pair intersecting along a line, and the three lines are non-coincident. Then, are these three lines concurrent?I think this is a classic result in geometry. If three planes intersect pairwise, their lines of intersection are either concurrent or they form a triangular prism, meaning they are parallel or something. Wait, no, in three-dimensional space, if three planes intersect pairwise, the three lines of intersection must either be concurrent or parallel.But the proposition says that if they are non-coincident, then they are concurrent. Wait, non-coincident just means they are distinct lines, right? So, if three planes intersect pairwise, producing three distinct lines, then these three lines must meet at a single point.Is that always true? Let me think. If three planes intersect pairwise, their lines of intersection can either all meet at a single point or be parallel. But if they are non-coincident, does that mean they must meet at a point?Wait, no. For example, imagine three planes: the xy-plane, the yz-plane, and the xz-plane. Their pairwise intersections are the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, which are concurrent at the origin. So, in that case, they are concurrent.But what if I have three planes that are not all passing through the same point? For example, take the xy-plane, the plane z=1, and another plane, say, y=1. Then, the intersection of xy-plane and z=1 is the line y=1, z=1. The intersection of xy-plane and y=1 is the line y=1, z=0. The intersection of z=1 and y=1 is the line y=1, z=1, x arbitrary. Wait, no, actually, z=1 and y=1 intersect along the line y=1, z=1, which is the same as the intersection of xy-plane and z=1. So, in this case, two lines coincide, but the third is different. So, in this case, the lines are not all distinct.Wait, so maybe if three planes intersect pairwise in three distinct lines, then those lines must be concurrent. Because if they weren't, then the planes would have to be arranged in such a way that their lines of intersection don't meet at a single point. But is that possible?Wait, let me think of another example. Suppose I have three planes: plane 1 is z=0, plane 2 is z=1, and plane 3 is some slanted plane that intersects both z=0 and z=1 along different lines. So, plane 3 could be, say, y = z. Then, the intersection of plane 3 with z=0 is the line y=0, z=0. The intersection of plane 3 with z=1 is the line y=1, z=1. The intersection of plane 1 and plane 2 is empty because they are parallel. Wait, no, plane 1 and plane 2 are parallel, so they don't intersect. So, that's not a good example because the pairwise intersections would not all be lines.Wait, the original proposition says \\"three planes intersect pairwise, producing three non-coincident lines.\\" So, all three pairs must intersect in lines, which means that no two planes are parallel. So, in my previous example, plane 1 and plane 2 were parallel, which is not allowed here because their intersection is not a line but empty. So, in the proposition, the three planes must intersect pairwise in lines, meaning that all three planes are non-parallel and intersect each other.So, in that case, do their lines of intersection have to be concurrent?I think yes. Because if three planes intersect pairwise, and none are parallel, then their lines of intersection must meet at a single point. Let me see.Suppose plane A, plane B, and plane C intersect pairwise along lines L_AB, L_AC, and L_BC. If these lines are not concurrent, then they must form a triangular prism or something. But in three-dimensional space, three planes intersecting pairwise must either all meet along a common line or meet at a single point.Wait, no. If three planes intersect pairwise, their lines of intersection can either all meet at a single point (concurrent) or be parallel. But if the planes are not all parallel, then their lines of intersection can't be parallel. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.Wait, actually, if three planes are such that each pair intersects in a line, and none of the lines are parallel, then those lines must meet at a single point. Because if two lines lie on two different planes, and the third plane intersects both, then the point of intersection must lie on all three planes, hence on all three lines.Let me formalize that. Suppose plane A and plane B intersect along line L_AB. Plane A and plane C intersect along line L_AC. Plane B and plane C intersect along line L_BC. If L_AB and L_AC are not parallel, they must intersect at some point P. Since P lies on both L_AB and L_AC, it must lie on plane A and plane B and plane C. Therefore, P lies on L_BC as well. Therefore, all three lines intersect at point P.Therefore, the three lines must be concurrent. So, proposition (4) is true.Wait, but hold on. What if the three planes are arranged such that their lines of intersection are parallel? Is that possible?Wait, if three planes are such that each pair intersects in a line, and all three lines are parallel, then the planes must be arranged like pages of a book, each intersecting along parallel lines. But in three-dimensional space, can three planes intersect pairwise in parallel lines?Wait, no. Because if two planes intersect in a line, and a third plane intersects both in parallel lines, then the third plane must be parallel to the line of intersection of the first two planes. But if it's parallel, then it can't intersect the first two planes in parallel lines unless it's also parallel to the planes themselves, which would make the intersections either empty or the same line.Wait, maybe I'm confusing something here. Let me think again.Suppose plane A and plane B intersect along line L. Plane C intersects plane A along line M and plane B along line N. If M and N are parallel to L, then plane C must be parallel to line L. But plane C intersects plane A along M and plane B along N, which are both parallel to L. So, if plane C is parallel to L, then it can't intersect plane A and plane B unless it's parallel to them as well, which would make the intersections empty or coinciding.Wait, maybe it's not possible for three planes to intersect pairwise in three distinct parallel lines. Because if two planes intersect in line L, any third plane intersecting both in lines parallel to L would have to be parallel to L, but then it can't intersect the first two planes in distinct lines unless it's also parallel to them, which would make the intersections empty or coinciding.Therefore, if three planes intersect pairwise in three distinct lines, those lines must intersect at a single point. So, proposition (4) is true.So, summarizing:Proposition (1): TrueProposition (2): FalseProposition (3): TrueProposition (4): TrueTherefore, only proposition (2) is false. So, the number of false propositions is 1. So, the answer should be A.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check proposition (1). Because I initially thought it was true, but maybe I was wrong.Proposition (1): For any two lines in space, there exist infinitely many planes with equal angles formed with these two lines.So, equal angles with both lines. So, for any two lines, can we find infinitely many planes such that the angle between the plane and each line is equal?I think this is similar to the concept of the angle bisector between two lines, but in three dimensions. In 3D, the set of planes that make equal angles with two lines would form a kind of ruled surface.But is it always infinitely many? Let me think.If the two lines are skew, then the set of planes that make equal angles with both lines would form a quadric surface, perhaps a hyperbolic paraboloid or a hyperboloid, which is a doubly ruled surface, meaning it has infinitely many lines on it. So, in that case, yes, there are infinitely many planes.If the two lines intersect, then the set of planes that make equal angles with both lines would include the angle bisector planes. For two intersecting lines, there are infinitely many planes that bisect the angle between them, each rotated around the line of intersection.Similarly, if the two lines are parallel, then any plane that makes equal angles with both lines would have to be equidistant in some way. But for parallel lines, I think the set of planes that make equal angles with both lines would be planes that are equally inclined to both lines, which would form another set of planes, perhaps also infinite.Wait, for parallel lines, the angle between a plane and a line is determined by the angle between the line and the normal vector of the plane. So, if two lines are parallel, their direction vectors are the same. So, the angle between a plane and each line would be determined by the angle between the direction vector and the normal vector of the plane.So, if we want the angle to be equal for both lines, since the direction vectors are the same, the condition is automatically satisfied for any plane. Wait, no. Wait, if the direction vectors are the same, then the angle between the plane and each line is determined by the angle between the direction vector and the normal vector.So, if the direction vectors are the same, then the angle between the plane and each line is the same for both lines, regardless of the plane. Wait, that can't be. Because the angle between a line and a plane is defined as the complement of the angle between the line and the normal vector. So, if two lines are parallel, then for any plane, the angle between the plane and each line is equal because their direction vectors are the same.Wait, that would mean that for any plane, the angle with both lines is equal. So, in that case, there are infinitely many planes with equal angles with both lines, which is the case.But if the lines are not parallel and not intersecting (i.e., skew), then as I thought earlier, there are infinitely many planes that make equal angles with both lines.If the lines are intersecting, then again, there are infinitely many planes that make equal angles with both lines, each rotated around the line of intersection.So, in all cases, whether the lines are parallel, intersecting, or skew, there are infinitely many planes that make equal angles with both lines. Therefore, proposition (1) is actually true.So, that confirms that only proposition (2) is false. So, the number of false propositions is 1, which is option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Given that M is a point inside triangle ABC, and overrightarrow {AB} cdot overrightarrow {AC} = 2 sqrt {3}, angle BAC = 30^circ. If the areas of triangle MBC, triangle MCA, and triangle MAB are frac {1}{2}, x, and y respectively, then the minimum value of frac {1}{x} + frac {4}{y} is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about a point M inside triangle ABC. The problem gives me some vector information: the dot product of vectors AB and AC is 2√3, and the angle at A, angle BAC, is 30 degrees. Then, it tells me that the areas of triangles MBC, MCA, and MAB are 1/2, x, and y respectively. I need to find the minimum value of 1/x + 4/y.Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, I know that in a triangle, if a point M is inside it, the areas of the smaller triangles formed by M and the sides can be related to the barycentric coordinates of M. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.Wait, the problem gives me the dot product of vectors AB and AC. Maybe I can use that to find the lengths of AB and AC or something else about the triangle ABC.The dot product formula is: AB · AC = |AB||AC|cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them. Here, theta is 30 degrees, so cos(theta) is √3/2. So, AB · AC = |AB||AC|*(√3/2) = 2√3. So, |AB||AC|*(√3/2) = 2√3. Let me solve for |AB||AC|.Multiplying both sides by 2/√3: |AB||AC| = (2√3)*(2/√3) = 4. So, |AB||AC| = 4.Okay, so the product of the lengths of AB and AC is 4. That might be useful later.Now, the areas of the triangles MBC, MCA, and MAB are given as 1/2, x, and y. Since M is inside ABC, the sum of these areas should be equal to the area of ABC.So, 1/2 + x + y = Area of ABC.I need to find the area of ABC. Maybe I can compute it using the given information.I know that the area of a triangle can be found using (1/2)*ab*sin(theta), where a and b are two sides, and theta is the included angle. In this case, sides AB and AC with angle 30 degrees.So, Area of ABC = (1/2)*|AB||AC|*sin(30°). We know |AB||AC| = 4, and sin(30°) = 1/2. So, Area of ABC = (1/2)*4*(1/2) = (1/2)*4*(1/2) = 1.Wait, so the area of ABC is 1. Then, 1/2 + x + y = 1, which implies x + y = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. So, x + y = 1/2.Alright, so x and y are positive numbers such that x + y = 1/2. I need to minimize 1/x + 4/y.Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.Let me think about using Cauchy-Schwarz. The expression 1/x + 4/y can be thought of as (1/x + 4/y) * (x + y) >= (1 + 2)^2 = 9, by Cauchy-Schwarz. Since x + y = 1/2, then (1/x + 4/y)*(1/2) >= 9, so 1/x + 4/y >= 18.Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the minimum value is 18? But let me verify if equality holds.For equality in Cauchy-Schwarz, we need 1/x = 2/y, because the vectors would have to be proportional. So, 1/x = 2/y implies y = 2x.Given that x + y = 1/2, substituting y = 2x gives x + 2x = 1/2 => 3x = 1/2 => x = 1/6, y = 1/3.So, plugging back into 1/x + 4/y: 1/(1/6) + 4/(1/3) = 6 + 12 = 18. So, yes, equality holds when x = 1/6 and y = 1/3.Therefore, the minimum value is 18.Wait, but before I conclude, let me make sure that such a point M exists inside the triangle ABC that gives x = 1/6 and y = 1/3. Because sometimes, in optimization problems, the minimal value might not be attainable within the constraints.But in this case, since x and y are areas of triangles formed by a point inside ABC, and since x and y are positive and sum to 1/2, such a point M should exist. It's similar to barycentric coordinates where the weights are positive and sum to the total area.Alternatively, maybe using mass point geometry or area ratios, but I think the Cauchy-Schwarz approach suffices here.So, I think the minimum value is 18.**Final Answer**boxed{18}"},{"question":"Subtract 50 from 2100, then add 20.

Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand the setup. On Monday, Millie puts a quart of seeds into the feeder. 25% of these seeds are millet. So, that means on Monday, she adds 0.25 quarts of millet and 0.75 quarts of other seeds. Got that.Then, each day after that, she adds another quart of the same mix. So, every day, she adds 25% millet and 75% other seeds. Importantly, she doesn't remove any seeds that are left from previous days. So, the feeder accumulates seeds each day.Now, the birds have a specific eating pattern. Each day, they eat only 25% of the millet in the feeder but eat all of the other seeds. So, every day, the non-millet seeds get completely eaten, but only a quarter of the millet gets eaten, leaving the rest for the next day.The question is asking: On which day, just after Millie has placed the seeds, will the birds find that more than half the seeds in the feeder are millet?So, we need to track the amount of millet and other seeds each day, considering both the addition of new seeds and the consumption by the birds.Let me structure this. I think I'll make a table for each day, starting from Monday, and track the amount of millet and other seeds before and after the birds eat.Let me define variables:Let M_n be the amount of millet on day n, just after Millie adds the seeds.Let O_n be the amount of other seeds on day n, just after Millie adds the seeds.But wait, actually, the birds eat after Millie adds the seeds. So, each day, Millie adds seeds, then the birds eat. So, the process is:1. Millie adds a quart: 0.25 millet, 0.75 others.2. Birds eat: 25% of millet, all of others.So, the next day, before Millie adds more seeds, the feeder has 75% of the previous day's millet and 0 other seeds.Therefore, each day, the feeder starts with some millet (from previous days), then Millie adds more seeds, and then the birds eat.Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of each day's cycle:- Start of day: feeder has some seeds left from previous days.- Millie adds a quart: 0.25 millet, 0.75 others.- Birds eat: 25% of total millet, all of other seeds.So, the feeder at the end of the day (after birds eat) has 75% of the millet that was present before the birds ate.But since Millie adds seeds each day, the feeder's millet is a combination of leftover millet from previous days and the new millet she adds.Wait, maybe it's better to model it day by day.Let me try that.Let me denote:At the end of each day (after birds eat), the feeder has some amount of millet. Then, the next day, Millie adds another quart, which includes 0.25 millet and 0.75 others. Then, the birds eat 25% of the total millet and all of the others.So, perhaps I should model the amount of millet at the end of each day.Let me define E_n as the amount of millet at the end of day n (after birds have eaten). Then, the next day, Millie adds 0.25 millet, so before the birds eat on day n+1, the feeder has E_n + 0.25 millet, and 0.75 other seeds. Then, the birds eat 25% of the millet, so they leave 75% of it, and eat all the others.Therefore, E_{n+1} = 0.75*(E_n + 0.25)That seems like a recursive formula.So, starting from Monday.Wait, let's clarify the days.On Monday, Millie puts the first quart. Then, the birds eat. So, Monday is day 1.Wait, but the question is asking on which day, just after Millie has placed the seeds, the birds find more than half the seeds are millet.So, the key is to calculate, after Millie adds the seeds each day, before the birds eat, the proportion of millet in the feeder.So, perhaps I need to track the amount of millet and other seeds right after Millie adds them, before the birds eat.So, let me adjust my variables.Let me define:After Millie adds seeds on day n, the feeder has M_n millet and O_n other seeds.Then, the birds eat 25% of M_n and all of O_n.So, the feeder at the end of day n (after birds eat) has 0.75*M_n millet and 0 other seeds.Then, on day n+1, Millie adds another quart: 0.25 millet and 0.75 others.Therefore, the feeder before the birds eat on day n+1 has (0.75*M_n + 0.25) millet and 0.75 others.So, the process is:M_{n+1} = 0.75*M_n + 0.25O_{n+1} = 0.75But wait, actually, O_{n+1} is always 0.75 because Millie adds 0.75 each day, and the birds eat all of them each day.But M_{n+1} depends on the previous day's leftover millet plus the new millet.So, the recursion is M_{n+1} = 0.75*M_n + 0.25This is a linear recurrence relation.Given that, we can model the amount of millet each day after Millie adds seeds.We need to find the smallest n such that M_n / (M_n + O_n) > 0.5Since O_n is always 0.75 on each day after Millie adds seeds, we can write:M_n / (M_n + 0.75) > 0.5Which simplifies to:M_n > 0.5*(M_n + 0.75)Multiply both sides by 2:2*M_n > M_n + 0.75Subtract M_n:M_n > 0.75So, we need to find the smallest n such that M_n > 0.75 quarts.So, our target is to find when M_n exceeds 0.75 quarts.Given that, let's compute M_n each day.We can solve the recurrence relation M_{n+1} = 0.75*M_n + 0.25This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques.First, let's find the homogeneous solution and particular solution.The homogeneous equation is M_{n+1} = 0.75*M_nThe characteristic equation is r = 0.75, so the homogeneous solution is M_n^h = C*(0.75)^nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (0.25), we can assume a constant particular solution M_n^p = K.Substitute into the recurrence:K = 0.75*K + 0.25Solve for K:K - 0.75*K = 0.250.25*K = 0.25K = 1So, the general solution is M_n = M_n^h + M_n^p = C*(0.75)^n + 1Now, apply the initial condition. On day 1 (Monday), Millie adds 0.25 quarts of millet. So, M_1 = 0.25Plug into the general solution:0.25 = C*(0.75)^1 + 10.25 = 0.75*C + 1Subtract 1:-0.75 = 0.75*CDivide by 0.75:C = -1Therefore, the solution is M_n = -1*(0.75)^n + 1Simplify:M_n = 1 - (0.75)^nSo, each day, the amount of millet just after Millie adds seeds is M_n = 1 - (0.75)^nWe need to find the smallest n such that M_n > 0.75So,1 - (0.75)^n > 0.75Subtract 1:- (0.75)^n > -0.25Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality sign flips):(0.75)^n < 0.25We need to solve for n in the inequality (0.75)^n < 0.25Take natural logarithm on both sides:ln((0.75)^n) < ln(0.25)n*ln(0.75) < ln(0.25)Since ln(0.75) is negative, dividing both sides by ln(0.75) will flip the inequality:n > ln(0.25)/ln(0.75)Compute ln(0.25) ≈ -1.3863ln(0.75) ≈ -0.2877So,n > (-1.3863)/(-0.2877) ≈ 4.819So, n must be greater than approximately 4.819. Since n is an integer (days), the smallest integer greater than 4.819 is 5.Therefore, on day 5, M_n will exceed 0.75 quarts.But wait, let's confirm this because sometimes when dealing with inequalities and exponentials, it's better to compute each day step by step to ensure.Let me compute M_n for each day:n=1 (Monday): M_1 = 1 - 0.75^1 = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25n=2 (Tuesday): M_2 = 1 - 0.75^2 = 1 - 0.5625 = 0.4375n=3 (Wednesday): M_3 = 1 - 0.75^3 = 1 - 0.421875 = 0.578125n=4 (Thursday): M_4 = 1 - 0.75^4 = 1 - 0.31640625 = 0.68359375n=5 (Friday): M_5 = 1 - 0.75^5 = 1 - 0.2373046875 ≈ 0.7626953125So, on day 5 (Friday), M_n ≈ 0.7627, which is greater than 0.75.Therefore, on Friday, just after Millie adds the seeds, the amount of millet is more than 0.75 quarts, and since the other seeds added each day are 0.75 quarts, the total seeds are M_n + 0.75.Wait, hold on. Wait, on each day, after Millie adds seeds, the total seeds are M_n + 0.75. So, the proportion of millet is M_n / (M_n + 0.75). We found that when M_n > 0.75, the proportion is greater than 0.5.But let's compute the proportion for each day to be thorough.n=1 (Monday):M_1 = 0.25, O_1 = 0.75Total = 1 quartProportion of millet = 0.25 / 1 = 0.25 < 0.5n=2 (Tuesday):M_2 = 0.4375, O_2 = 0.75Total = 0.4375 + 0.75 = 1.1875Proportion = 0.4375 / 1.1875 ≈ 0.368 < 0.5n=3 (Wednesday):M_3 = 0.578125, O_3 = 0.75Total = 0.578125 + 0.75 = 1.328125Proportion ≈ 0.578125 / 1.328125 ≈ 0.435 < 0.5n=4 (Thursday):M_4 ≈ 0.68359375, O_4 = 0.75Total ≈ 0.68359375 + 0.75 ≈ 1.43359375Proportion ≈ 0.68359375 / 1.43359375 ≈ 0.476 < 0.5n=5 (Friday):M_5 ≈ 0.7626953125, O_5 = 0.75Total ≈ 0.7626953125 + 0.75 ≈ 1.5126953125Proportion ≈ 0.7626953125 / 1.5126953125 ≈ 0.504 > 0.5So, on Friday, the proportion is just over 50%. Therefore, the answer is Friday, which is option D.But wait, let me double-check because sometimes these problems can be tricky with the days.Wait, the problem says \\"on which day, just after Millie has placed the seeds...\\" So, the first day is Monday, then Tuesday, etc.So, n=1 is Monday, n=2 is Tuesday, n=3 is Wednesday, n=4 is Thursday, n=5 is Friday.So, yes, on Friday, just after Millie adds the seeds, the proportion of millet exceeds 50%.Therefore, the answer is Friday, which is option D.But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the days.Wait, on Monday, she adds seeds, then birds eat. So, the cycle is:Monday: add seeds, then birds eat.Tuesday: add seeds, then birds eat.So, each day, after adding seeds, the feeder has M_n and O_n, then birds eat.So, the proportion we calculated is right after adding seeds, before birds eat.So, on day n, after adding seeds, the proportion is M_n / (M_n + O_n). So, yes, on Friday, that proportion is just over 50%.Therefore, the answer is Friday, which is D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"From the 10 integers from 1 to 10, how many numbers must be selected to ensure that the sum of two of them is equal to 10?A. 4B. 5C. 6D. 7","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: From the integers 1 to 10, how many numbers must be selected to ensure that the sum of two of them is equal to 10? The options are A. 4, B. 5, C. 6, D. 7. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I think this is a problem related to the pigeonhole principle. That principle basically says that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. Maybe I can apply that here somehow.So, the numbers from 1 to 10. I need to ensure that among the selected numbers, there are two that add up to 10. Let me list out the pairs of numbers that add up to 10:- 1 and 9- 2 and 8- 3 and 7- 4 and 6- 5 and 5Wait, 5 and 5? But since we're selecting from 1 to 10, and each number is unique, I can't have two 5s unless I select 5 twice, which isn't allowed here. So, maybe 5 is a special case. Hmm.So, the pairs are (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), and then 5 is alone because it can't pair with another 5. So, how many pairs are there? Let's count: 1-9, 2-8, 3-7, 4-6. That's four pairs, and then 5 is by itself.So, if I think of each pair as a pigeonhole, there are 4 pigeonholes for the pairs and 1 pigeonhole for the number 5. So, in total, 5 pigeonholes.Now, if I want to avoid having any two numbers that add up to 10, I need to make sure that I don't pick both numbers from any of these pairs. So, for each pair, I can pick at most one number. For the number 5, I can pick it or not, but it doesn't affect the sum unless I pick another 5, which isn't possible.So, the maximum number of numbers I can pick without having any two that add up to 10 would be the number of pairs plus one (for the number 5). Wait, no. Let me think again.Each pair is two numbers. If I want to avoid having both numbers from any pair, I can pick at most one number from each pair. So, for each of the four pairs, I can pick one number, and then I can also pick the number 5. So, that would be 4 + 1 = 5 numbers.So, if I pick 5 numbers, it's possible that none of them add up to 10. For example, I could pick one number from each pair and also pick 5. So, that would be 5 numbers without any two adding to 10.But if I pick one more number, making it 6 numbers, then I have to pick another number. But since I've already picked one from each pair and 5, the next number has to come from one of the pairs I've already picked a number from. So, that would mean I have two numbers from the same pair, which add up to 10.Therefore, the minimum number of numbers I need to pick to ensure that at least two of them add up to 10 is 6.Wait, let me test this logic. Suppose I pick 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. None of these add up to 10. If I pick another number, say 6, then 4 and 6 add up to 10. If I pick 7 instead, then 3 and 7 add up to 10. Similarly, 8 would pair with 2, and 9 would pair with 1. So, yes, picking 6 numbers forces at least one pair to add up to 10.So, the answer should be 6, which is option C.But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a way to pick 6 numbers without having any two add up to 10? If I try to pick 6 numbers, I have to include at least two numbers from the same pair. Since there are only 4 pairs, and 5 numbers (including 5) can be picked without conflict, adding a 6th number must come from one of the existing pairs, thus creating a sum of 10.Yes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 6, which is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"What is the sum of the digits of the base-2 expression for 222_{10}?","answer":"To determine the sum of the digits in the base-2 representation of 222 in decimal, I will first convert the number to binary.I'll start by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 222.

The full price of a ticket to the scenic spot is 150 yuan. Xiao Ming and his grandmother each bought a half-price ticket, his grandfather got a free ticket, and his parents each bought a full-price ticket. The average cost of tickets per person for the 5 of them is     yuan.","answer":"First, I need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for Xiao Ming's family. Xiao Ming and his grandmother each bought a half-price ticket. Since the full price is 150 yuan, each half-price ticket costs 75 yuan. Therefore, the cost for both Xiao Ming and his grandmother is 2 multiplied by 75 yuan, which equals 150 yuan.Xiao Ming's grandfather received a free ticket, so his ticket costs 0 yuan.Xiao Ming's parents each bought a full-price ticket, costing 150 yuan each. Thus, the cost for both parents is 2 multiplied by 150 yuan, totaling 300 yuan.Adding all these together, the total cost for the family is 150 yuan (for Xiao Ming and his grandmother) plus 0 yuan (for his grandfather) plus 300 yuan (for his parents), which equals 450 yuan.There are 5 family members in total. To find the average cost per person, I divide the total cost by the number of people: 450 yuan divided by 5 equals 90 yuan.Therefore, the average cost of the tickets per person is 90 yuan."},{"question":"In a certain month, the dates of three of the Sundays are prime numbers. On what day of the week does the 7th of the month fall?A) ThursdayB) FridayC) SaturdayD) MondayE) Tuesday","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: In a certain month, the dates of three of the Sundays are prime numbers. On what day of the week does the 7th of the month fall? The options are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Monday, or Tuesday. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It says that in a particular month, three of the Sundays fall on prime-numbered dates. I need to determine what day of the week the 7th of that month is. So, the key here is to figure out the possible Sundays that are prime numbers and then see how that affects the day of the week for the 7th.Let me recall that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the prime numbers less than 31 (since months have at most 31 days) are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. But since months don't have 31 days every time, but let's keep that in mind.Now, the Sundays in the month are three in number, and their dates are prime numbers. So, we need to find a month where three Sundays fall on these prime dates. Let me think about how Sundays are distributed in a month.A month can have 28 to 31 days. Since 28 is exactly 4 weeks, but if a month has more days, the extra days will affect the distribution of the days of the week. So, depending on how the month starts, the Sundays can fall on different dates.Let me denote the first day of the month as some day of the week. Let's say the first day is a Sunday. Then, the Sundays would fall on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th. That's five Sundays in a 31-day month. But in this case, the prime-numbered Sundays would be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31. Wait, but if the Sundays are on 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, then only 29 is a prime number. So, that's just one Sunday. But the problem says three Sundays are prime numbers. So, starting on Sunday doesn't give us enough prime Sundays.Let me try another starting day. Suppose the first day of the month is a Monday. Then, the Sundays would be on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th. So, four Sundays. Now, checking which of these are prime: 7 is prime, 14 is not, 21 is not, 28 is not. So, only one prime Sunday. Still not enough.Next, if the first day is a Tuesday. Then, Sundays would be on the 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th. Checking primes: 6 is not prime, 13 is prime, 20 is not, 27 is not. So, only one prime Sunday again.If the first day is a Wednesday, Sundays would be on the 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Checking primes: 5 is prime, 12 is not, 19 is prime, 26 is not. So, two prime Sundays. Closer, but still not three.If the first day is a Thursday, Sundays would be on the 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th. Checking primes: 4 is not, 11 is prime, 18 is not, 25 is not. So, only one prime Sunday.If the first day is a Friday, Sundays would be on the 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, 31st. Checking primes: 3 is prime, 10 is not, 17 is prime, 24 is not, 31 is prime. So, three prime Sundays: 3, 17, and 31. That's three! So, if the month starts on a Friday, Sundays fall on the 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, and 31st. Among these, 3, 17, and 31 are prime numbers. Perfect, that's three Sundays on prime dates.Wait, hold on. Let me confirm if 31 is a prime number. Yes, 31 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 31. So, that works. So, if the month starts on a Friday, then the Sundays are on 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. So, three of them are prime: 3, 17, 31.So, that seems to fit the condition. Therefore, the first day of the month is a Friday.Now, the question is, on what day of the week does the 7th fall? If the first day is Friday, then the 1st is Friday, 2nd is Saturday, 3rd is Sunday, 4th is Monday, 5th is Tuesday, 6th is Wednesday, 7th is Thursday. So, the 7th is a Thursday.Wait, but let me check again. If the 1st is Friday, then:1st: Friday2nd: Saturday3rd: Sunday4th: Monday5th: Tuesday6th: Wednesday7th: ThursdayYes, that's correct. So, the 7th is a Thursday.But wait, let me make sure there isn't another possibility. Maybe another starting day could also give three Sundays on prime dates. Let me check.We saw that starting on Friday gives three prime Sundays: 3, 17, 31. Let me check if starting on another day could also result in three prime Sundays.For example, starting on Saturday. Then, Sundays would be on the 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th. Checking primes: 2 is prime, 9 is not, 16 is not, 23 is prime, 30 is not. So, only two prime Sundays: 2 and 23. Not enough.Starting on Sunday: Sundays on 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. Only 29 is prime. So, one.Starting on Monday: Sundays on 7, 14, 21, 28. Only 7 is prime. One.Starting on Tuesday: Sundays on 6, 13, 20, 27. Only 13 is prime. One.Starting on Wednesday: Sundays on 5, 12, 19, 26. 5 and 19 are prime. Two.Starting on Thursday: Sundays on 4, 11, 18, 25. Only 11 is prime. One.So, only starting on Friday gives three prime Sundays: 3, 17, 31. Therefore, the first day is Friday.Therefore, the 7th is a Thursday.Wait, but let me think again. Is 31 always a valid date? Because not all months have 31 days. For example, April, June, September, November have 30 days. February has 28 or 29. So, if the month is, say, April, which has 30 days, then the Sundays would be on 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31. But April only has 30 days, so the 31st doesn't exist. Therefore, in that case, the Sundays would be on 3, 10, 17, 24. So, only two prime Sundays: 3 and 17. So, that wouldn't satisfy the condition of three Sundays being prime.Therefore, the month in question must have 31 days because otherwise, the 31st Sunday wouldn't exist. So, the month must be a 31-day month: January, March, May, July, August, October, December.So, in those months, starting on Friday, the Sundays are on 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, which are three primes: 3, 17, 31.So, that works.Therefore, the first day is Friday, so the 7th is Thursday.Wait, but let me check another thing. If the month starts on Friday, then the 7th is Thursday. But let me make sure that in a 31-day month starting on Friday, the Sundays are indeed on 3, 10, 17, 24, 31.Yes, because:1st: Friday2nd: Saturday3rd: Sunday4th: Monday5th: Tuesday6th: Wednesday7th: Thursday8th: Friday9th: Saturday10th: Sunday11th: Monday12th: Tuesday13th: Wednesday14th: Thursday15th: Friday16th: Saturday17th: Sunday18th: Monday19th: Tuesday20th: Wednesday21st: Thursday22nd: Friday23rd: Saturday24th: Sunday25th: Monday26th: Tuesday27th: Wednesday28th: Thursday29th: Friday30th: Saturday31st: SundayYes, that's correct. So, Sundays on 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. So, three of them are primes: 3, 17, 31.Therefore, the 7th is Thursday.But wait, let me think if there's another possibility where the month has 30 days, but still has three Sundays on prime dates. For example, if the month starts on a different day, maybe we can have three Sundays on primes even in a 30-day month.Let me try starting on Thursday. Then, Sundays would be on 4, 11, 18, 25. Checking primes: 4 is not, 11 is prime, 18 is not, 25 is not. So, only one prime Sunday.Starting on Wednesday: Sundays on 5, 12, 19, 26. Primes: 5 and 19. Two primes.Starting on Tuesday: Sundays on 6, 13, 20, 27. Primes: 13. One.Starting on Monday: Sundays on 7, 14, 21, 28. Primes: 7. One.Starting on Sunday: Sundays on 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. Primes: 29. One.Starting on Saturday: Sundays on 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. Primes: 2 and 23. Two.Starting on Friday: Sundays on 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. But in a 30-day month, 31 doesn't exist, so Sundays on 3, 10, 17, 24. Primes: 3 and 17. Two.So, in a 30-day month, the maximum number of prime Sundays is two. Therefore, the month must have 31 days to have three prime Sundays.Therefore, the first day is Friday, and the 7th is Thursday.Wait, but let me think again. If the month is February, which has 28 days, but in a leap year, it has 29. So, in February, starting on Friday, Sundays would be on 3, 10, 17, 24. So, primes: 3 and 17. Only two. So, not enough.In a non-leap year, February has 28 days, so Sundays on 3, 10, 17, 24. Still two primes.Therefore, only in a 31-day month starting on Friday, we have three prime Sundays.Therefore, the 7th is Thursday.So, the answer should be Thursday, which is option A.But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the days.If the first day is Friday, then:1: Fri2: Sat3: Sun4: Mon5: Tue6: Wed7: ThuYes, that's correct. So, 7th is Thursday.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Let's consider the Sundays that are prime numbers. The prime numbers in the range of 1-31 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31.We need three Sundays to be among these. So, the Sundays must be on three of these dates.Now, the Sundays are spaced 7 days apart. So, if one Sunday is on a prime date, the next Sunday is 7 days later, which would be a non-prime date because adding 7 to a prime (except 2 and 3) can sometimes result in another prime, but usually not.Wait, for example, 2 + 7 = 9, which is not prime. 3 + 7 = 10, not prime. 5 + 7 = 12, not prime. 7 + 7 = 14, not prime. 11 + 7 = 18, not prime. 13 + 7 = 20, not prime. 17 + 7 = 24, not prime. 19 + 7 = 26, not prime. 23 + 7 = 30, not prime. 29 + 7 = 36, which is beyond 31. 31 + 7 = 38, beyond.So, the only way to have multiple Sundays on prime dates is if the Sundays are on 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, but spaced 7 days apart.Wait, but 2 and 9 (not prime), 3 and 10 (not prime), 5 and 12 (not prime), etc. So, the only way to have three Sundays on prime dates is if the Sundays are on 3, 17, 31. Because 3 + 14 = 17, and 17 +14=31. So, three Sundays: 3, 17, 31.Similarly, 5, 19, 33 (but 33 is beyond 31). So, only two primes: 5 and 19.Similarly, 7, 21 (not prime), 28 (not prime). So, only one prime.Similarly, 11, 18 (not prime), 25 (not prime). Only one.13, 20 (not prime), 27 (not prime). Only one.So, the only set of three Sundays on prime dates is 3, 17, 31.Therefore, the Sundays must be on 3, 17, 31. So, the first Sunday is on the 3rd. Therefore, the first day of the month is two days before Sunday, which is Friday.Therefore, the first day is Friday, so the 7th is Thursday.Yes, that seems consistent.Therefore, the answer is Thursday, which is option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"One side of a rectangle was increased by 3 times, while the other side was decreased by 2 times, resulting in a square.What is the side length of the square if the area of the rectangle is 54 m²?","answer":"First, I'll define the original dimensions of the rectangle.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that for a fraction to be zero, the numerator has to be zero while the denominator is not zero. So, I can separate this into two parts: solving the numerator equal to zero and making sure the denominator isn't zero at those points.Let me write down the numerator:sin pi x - cos 2pi x = 0And the denominator:(sin pi x - 1)^2 + cos^2 pi x - 1 neq 0So, first, I'll focus on solving the numerator equation. Maybe I can simplify it using some trigonometric identities.I know that cos 2theta = 1 - 2sin^2 theta, so let me apply that here. Let me set theta = pi x, so:cos 2pi x = 1 - 2sin^2 pi xSubstituting this into the numerator equation:sin pi x - (1 - 2sin^2 pi x) = 0Simplify that:sin pi x - 1 + 2sin^2 pi x = 0Let me rearrange the terms:2sin^2 pi x + sin pi x - 1 = 0Hmm, this looks like a quadratic equation in terms of sin pi x. Let me let y = sin pi x, so the equation becomes:2y^2 + y - 1 = 0Now, solving for y:Using the quadratic formula, y = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, where a=2, b=1, c=-1.So,y = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 8}}{4} = frac{-1 pm 3}{4}So, two solutions:1. y = frac{-1 + 3}{4} = frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2}2. y = frac{-1 - 3}{4} = frac{-4}{4} = -1So, sin pi x = frac{1}{2} or sin pi x = -1.Now, let's solve each case separately.**Case 1: sin pi x = frac{1}{2}**I know that sin theta = frac{1}{2} has solutions at theta = frac{pi}{6} + 2pi n and theta = frac{5pi}{6} + 2pi n for any integer n.So, substituting back theta = pi x:1. pi x = frac{pi}{6} + 2pi n => x = frac{1}{6} + 2n2. pi x = frac{5pi}{6} + 2pi n => x = frac{5}{6} + 2nSo, the solutions are x = frac{1}{6} + 2n and x = frac{5}{6} + 2n for any integer n.**Case 2: sin pi x = -1**sin theta = -1 occurs at theta = frac{3pi}{2} + 2pi n.So, substituting back:pi x = frac{3pi}{2} + 2pi n => x = frac{3}{2} + 2nSo, the solutions are x = frac{3}{2} + 2n for any integer n.Now, so all the potential solutions are:1. x = frac{1}{6} + 2n2. x = frac{5}{6} + 2n3. x = frac{3}{2} + 2nBut before we accept these as solutions, we need to make sure that they don't make the denominator zero. So, let's compute the denominator:(sin pi x - 1)^2 + cos^2 pi x - 1Let me simplify this expression. Let's expand (sin pi x - 1)^2:(sin pi x - 1)^2 = sin^2 pi x - 2sin pi x + 1So, substituting back into the denominator:sin^2 pi x - 2sin pi x + 1 + cos^2 pi x - 1Simplify:- The +1 and -1 cancel out.- sin^2 pi x + cos^2 pi x = 1, so we have 1 - 2 sin πxSo, denominator simplifies to:1 - 2sin pi xSo, the denominator is 1 - 2sin pi x, and we need this to not be zero. So,1 - 2sin pi x neq 0 implies sin pi x neq frac{1}{2}So, for the denominator not to be zero, sin pi x cannot be equal to 1/2.Wait, but in our solutions above, in Case 1, we have sin pi x = 1/2. So, those solutions would make the denominator zero, which is not allowed. Therefore, those solutions must be rejected.So, only the solutions from Case 2 are valid, where sin pi x = -1, which is fine because that doesn't make the denominator zero.So, the only solutions are x = frac{3}{2} + 2n for integer n.But wait, hold on, let me verify this.Because in Case 1, we have solutions where sin pi x = 1/2, which would make the denominator zero. Therefore, these solutions are invalid. So, only Case 2 solutions are valid.But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying the denominator.Original denominator:(sin pi x - 1)^2 + cos^2 pi x - 1Expanding (sin pi x -1)^2 gives:sin^2 pi x - 2 sin pi x + 1So, adding cos^2 pi x:sin^2 pi x + cos^2 pi x - 2 sin pi x + 1Which is:1 - 2 sin pi x + 1 because sin^2 + cos^2 =1Wait, that would be 1 +1 - 2 sin πx = 2 - 2 sin πxWait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier simplification. Let me recalculate.Wait, original denominator:(sin pi x -1)^2 + cos^2 pi x -1First, expand (sin pi x -1)^2:sin^2 pi x - 2 sin pi x + 1Then, add cos^2 pi x:sin^2 pi x + cos^2 pi x - 2 sin pi x + 1Which is:1 - 2 sin pi x + 1 because sin^2 + cos^2 =1So, that becomes:1 + 1 - 2 sin pi x = 2 - 2 sin pi xThen, subtract 1:Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original denominator is:(sin pi x -1)^2 + cos^2 pi x -1So, after expanding, we have:sin^2 pi x - 2 sin pi x + 1 + cos^2 pi x -1So, the +1 and -1 cancel, giving:sin^2 pi x + cos^2 pi x - 2 sin pi xWhich is:1 - 2 sin pi xAh, okay, so my initial simplification was correct. The denominator is 1 - 2 sin pi x, so it's not 2 - 2 sin πx. So, my mistake earlier was in miscalculating.So, denominator is 1 - 2 sin pi x, so it's zero when sin pi x = 1/2, which is exactly what we had in Case 1. So, indeed, those solutions make the denominator zero, so they are invalid.Therefore, only Case 2 solutions are valid, which are x = frac{3}{2} + 2n.So, the solutions are all real numbers of the form x = frac{3}{2} + 2n, where n is any integer.Now, the question is asking for the largest negative root. So, we need to find the maximum x < 0 such that x = 3/2 + 2n.Let me write down the general solution:x = frac{3}{2} + 2n, n ∈ ℤ.We need x < 0, so:frac{3}{2} + 2n < 0Solving for n:2n < -frac{3}{2}n < -frac{3}{4}Since n must be an integer, the largest integer less than -3/4 is n = -1.So, plugging n = -1:x = frac{3}{2} + 2(-1) = frac{3}{2} - 2 = -frac{1}{2}Wait, is that the largest negative root? Let me check n = -1 and n = -2.For n = -1: x = 3/2 - 2 = -1/2For n = -2: x = 3/2 - 4 = -5/2So, -1/2 is larger than -5/2, so indeed, the largest negative root is x = -1/2.But wait, let me verify if x = -1/2 is indeed a solution.Let me plug x = -1/2 into the original equation.First, compute numerator:sin(pi * (-1/2)) - cos(2pi * (-1/2))sin(-pi/2) - cos(-pi)sin(-pi/2) = -1, and cos(-pi) = cos pi = -1So, numerator: -1 - (-1) = -1 +1 = 0. Good.Denominator:(sin(pi*(-1/2)) -1)^2 + cos^2(pi*(-1/2)) -1Compute each term:sin(-pi/2) = -1, so first term: (-1 -1)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4cos(-pi/2) = 0, so cos^2(-pi/2) = 0^2 = 0So, denominator: 4 + 0 -1 = 3, which is not zero. So, x = -1/2 is indeed a valid solution.Is there a larger negative root? Let's see.If n = 0, x = 3/2, which is positive, so not negative.n = -1 gives x = -1/2n = -2 gives x = -5/2, which is more negative.So, yes, x = -1/2 is the largest negative root.Wait, but let me think again. Is x = -1/2 the largest negative root? Or is there another solution between -1/2 and 0?Wait, in our general solution, the solutions are x = 3/2 + 2n. So, for n = -1, x = -1/2; for n = 0, x = 3/2; n = 1, x = 7/2, etc. So, the negative solutions are x = -1/2, -5/2, -9/2, etc.So, the largest negative solution is indeed x = -1/2.But wait, hold on, let me check if there are any other solutions. Because sometimes when solving trigonometric equations, you might miss solutions.Wait, in the numerator, we had two cases: sin πx = 1/2 and sin πx = -1.But sin πx = 1/2 was rejected because it made the denominator zero.But perhaps, is there a case where sin πx = 1/2 but the denominator is not zero? Wait, no, because when sin πx = 1/2, denominator becomes 1 - 2*(1/2) = 0. So, those points are excluded.Therefore, only sin πx = -1 gives valid solutions.So, x = 3/2 + 2n.Therefore, the largest negative root is x = -1/2.Wait, but let me think about the periodicity. The function sin πx has a period of 2, right? Because sin π(x + 2) = sin(πx + 2π) = sin πx.Similarly, cos 2πx has a period of 1, because cos(2π(x +1)) = cos(2πx + 2π) = cos 2πx.So, the overall function is periodic with the least common multiple of 2 and 1, which is 2. So, the function repeats every 2 units.Therefore, the solutions should repeat every 2 units as well. So, x = 3/2 + 2n.Hence, the solutions are spaced 2 units apart, starting from 3/2.Therefore, in the negative direction, the solutions are 3/2 - 2, 3/2 -4, etc., which is -1/2, -5/2, etc.So, yeah, x = -1/2 is the largest negative solution.Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if x = -1/2 is indeed the closest negative solution to zero.Yes, because the next one is -5/2, which is -2.5, which is further away.So, x = -1/2 is the largest negative root.Therefore, the answer is x = -1/2.But just to confirm, let me plug x = -1/2 into the original equation.Numerator:sin(π*(-1/2)) - cos(2π*(-1/2)) = sin(-π/2) - cos(-π) = (-1) - (-1) = 0Denominator:(sin(π*(-1/2)) -1)^2 + cos^2(π*(-1/2)) -1 = (-1 -1)^2 + (0)^2 -1 = (4) + 0 -1 = 3 ≠ 0So, yes, it works.Therefore, the largest negative root is x = -1/2.**Final Answer**The largest negative root is boxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}."},{"question":"Let ( a ) and ( b ) be positive whole numbers such that ( frac{4.5}{11} < frac{a}{b} < frac{5}{11} ).

Since ( 4.5 = frac{9}{2} ), substituting that in, the inequality becomes:[frac{frac{9}{2}}{11} < frac{a}{b} < frac{5}{11}]Simplifying the left side:[frac{9}{22} < frac{a}{b} < frac{5}{11}]So, now I have:[frac{9}{22} < frac{a}{b} < frac{5}{11}]I need to find positive integers ( a ) and ( b ) such that this inequality holds, and ( a + b ) is minimized. Since ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers, ( frac{a}{b} ) is a positive rational number. The goal is to find such a fraction between ( frac{9}{22} ) and ( frac{5}{11} ) with the smallest possible sum ( a + b ).Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can list fractions between these two values and check their sums. But that might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can use Farey sequences or mediant properties to find the fraction with the smallest denominator between these two.Wait, Farey sequences... I remember that between two fractions ( frac{a}{b} ) and ( frac{c}{d} ), the mediant is ( frac{a + c}{b + d} ). The mediant lies between the two original fractions if they are neighbors in some Farey sequence. Maybe I can use that here.But first, let me note the two fractions:Left fraction: ( frac{9}{22} ) ≈ 0.4091Right fraction: ( frac{5}{11} ) ≈ 0.4545So, I need a fraction between approximately 0.4091 and 0.4545.I need to find the fraction ( frac{a}{b} ) in this interval with the smallest possible ( a + b ).Let me consider fractions with small denominators first because smaller denominators would likely lead to smaller sums ( a + b ).Starting with denominator ( b = 1 ):Possible fractions: ( frac{1}{1} = 1 ), which is way larger than 0.4545. So, no good.Denominator ( b = 2 ):Possible fractions: ( frac{1}{2} = 0.5 ), which is larger than 0.4545. ( frac{0}{2} = 0 ), which is too small. So, nothing here.Denominator ( b = 3 ):Possible fractions: ( frac{1}{3} ≈ 0.333 ), too small. ( frac{2}{3} ≈ 0.666 ), too big. So, no luck.Denominator ( b = 4 ):Fractions: ( frac{1}{4} = 0.25 ), too small. ( frac{2}{4} = 0.5 ), too big. ( frac{3}{4} = 0.75 ), too big. So, nothing here.Denominator ( b = 5 ):Fractions: ( frac{1}{5} = 0.2 ), too small. ( frac{2}{5} = 0.4 ), which is still less than 0.4091. ( frac{3}{5} = 0.6 ), too big. So, ( frac{2}{5} ) is just below the lower bound, so no good.Denominator ( b = 6 ):Fractions: ( frac{1}{6} ≈ 0.1667 ), too small. ( frac{2}{6} ≈ 0.333 ), too small. ( frac{3}{6} = 0.5 ), too big. ( frac{4}{6} ≈ 0.666 ), too big. So, nothing here.Denominator ( b = 7 ):Fractions: ( frac{1}{7} ≈ 0.1429 ), too small. ( frac{2}{7} ≈ 0.2857 ), too small. ( frac{3}{7} ≈ 0.4286 ), which is just above 0.4091. Let me check:( frac{3}{7} ≈ 0.4286 ). Is that between 0.4091 and 0.4545? Yes, it is. So, ( frac{3}{7} ) is a candidate.Sum ( a + b = 3 + 7 = 10 ).Is there a fraction with a smaller sum? Let's check denominators less than 7.Wait, we already checked denominators 1 through 6, and none of them gave a fraction in the desired interval except ( b = 7 ) giving ( frac{3}{7} ). So, perhaps 10 is the minimal sum? But let me check higher denominators just to be thorough, in case there's a fraction with a smaller sum.Wait, but if ( b ) is larger, say 8, then ( a ) would have to be at least 4 because ( frac{4}{8} = 0.5 ), which is too big. ( frac{3}{8} = 0.375 ), too small. So, nothing in between.Denominator ( b = 9 ):( frac{4}{9} ≈ 0.4444 ), which is just below 0.4545. So, ( frac{4}{9} ≈ 0.4444 ) is within the interval.Sum ( a + b = 4 + 9 = 13 ), which is larger than 10. So, 10 is still better.Denominator ( b = 10 ):( frac{4}{10} = 0.4 ), too small. ( frac{5}{10} = 0.5 ), too big. So, nothing here.Denominator ( b = 11 ):( frac{5}{11} ≈ 0.4545 ), which is the upper bound. So, we can't use that.Wait, but maybe ( b = 12 ):( frac{5}{12} ≈ 0.4167 ), which is above 0.4091. So, ( frac{5}{12} ≈ 0.4167 ) is within the interval.Sum ( a + b = 5 + 12 = 17 ), which is larger than 10.So, so far, ( frac{3}{7} ) with sum 10 is the best.But let me check if there are any other fractions with denominator less than 7 that I might have missed.Wait, denominator ( b = 5 ): ( frac{2}{5} = 0.4 ), which is just below the lower bound. ( frac{3}{5} = 0.6 ), which is too high.Denominator ( b = 4 ): ( frac{2}{4} = 0.5 ), too high. ( frac{1}{4} = 0.25 ), too low.Denominator ( b = 3 ): ( frac{1}{3} ≈ 0.333 ), too low. ( frac{2}{3} ≈ 0.666 ), too high.Denominator ( b = 2 ): ( frac{1}{2} = 0.5 ), too high.Denominator ( b = 1 ): Only 1, which is too high.So, indeed, the first fraction that falls into the interval is ( frac{3}{7} ) with sum 10.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I can find a fraction with a smaller denominator that I haven't considered. For example, is there a fraction with denominator 7 that is between 0.4091 and 0.4545?We have ( frac{3}{7} ≈ 0.4286 ), which is in the interval. The next one would be ( frac{4}{7} ≈ 0.5714 ), which is too high.So, only ( frac{3}{7} ) is in the interval for denominator 7.Is there a fraction with denominator 8? Let's see:( frac{3}{8} = 0.375 ), too low. ( frac{4}{8} = 0.5 ), too high. So, nothing in between.Denominator 9: ( frac{4}{9} ≈ 0.4444 ), which is in the interval, but sum is 13.Denominator 10: ( frac{4}{10} = 0.4 ), too low. ( frac{5}{10} = 0.5 ), too high.Denominator 11: ( frac{5}{11} ≈ 0.4545 ), which is the upper bound.Denominator 12: ( frac{5}{12} ≈ 0.4167 ), which is in the interval, but sum is 17.So, seems like ( frac{3}{7} ) is the fraction with the smallest ( a + b = 10 ).But wait, let me think about another approach. Maybe using continued fractions or something else.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of continued fractions to find the simplest fraction between the two given fractions.Given the two bounds:Lower bound: ( frac{9}{22} ≈ 0.4091 )Upper bound: ( frac{5}{11} ≈ 0.4545 )I can compute the continued fractions for both and see if there's a common convergent or something in between.But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can use the mediant property.The mediant of ( frac{9}{22} ) and ( frac{5}{11} ) is ( frac{9 + 5}{22 + 11} = frac{14}{33} ≈ 0.4242 ). Hmm, that's within the interval.So, ( frac{14}{33} ≈ 0.4242 ) is between ( frac{9}{22} ) and ( frac{5}{11} ).Sum ( a + b = 14 + 33 = 47 ), which is way larger than 10. So, not helpful.Alternatively, maybe I can find a fraction between them with a smaller denominator.Wait, another approach: Let's consider the inequality:[frac{9}{22} < frac{a}{b} < frac{5}{11}]Multiply all parts by ( b ):[frac{9}{22}b < a < frac{5}{11}b]Since ( a ) must be an integer, the interval ( (frac{9}{22}b, frac{5}{11}b) ) must contain at least one integer.So, for each ( b ), we can check if there's an integer ( a ) in that interval.We need to find the smallest ( b ) such that ( lceil frac{9}{22}b rceil < lfloor frac{5}{11}b rfloor ).Let me compute this for small ( b ):For ( b = 1 ):( frac{9}{22} ≈ 0.4091 ), ( frac{5}{11} ≈ 0.4545 ). So, ( a ) must be between ~0.4091 and ~0.4545. But ( a ) must be at least 1, which is too big.For ( b = 2 ):( frac{9}{22}*2 ≈ 0.818 ), ( frac{5}{11}*2 ≈ 0.909 ). So, ( a ) must be between ~0.818 and ~0.909. So, ( a = 1 ). Check if ( frac{1}{2} = 0.5 ) is between 0.4091 and 0.4545. No, 0.5 is larger than 0.4545. So, no good.For ( b = 3 ):( frac{9}{22}*3 ≈ 1.227 ), ( frac{5}{11}*3 ≈ 1.3636 ). So, ( a ) must be between ~1.227 and ~1.3636. So, ( a = 1 ). Check ( frac{1}{3} ≈ 0.333 ), which is below 0.4091. So, no good.For ( b = 4 ):( frac{9}{22}*4 ≈ 1.636 ), ( frac{5}{11}*4 ≈ 1.818 ). So, ( a ) must be between ~1.636 and ~1.818. So, ( a = 2 ). Check ( frac{2}{4} = 0.5 ), which is too big.For ( b = 5 ):( frac{9}{22}*5 ≈ 2.045 ), ( frac{5}{11}*5 ≈ 2.2727 ). So, ( a ) must be between ~2.045 and ~2.2727. So, ( a = 2 ). Check ( frac{2}{5} = 0.4 ), which is just below 0.4091. So, no good.For ( b = 6 ):( frac{9}{22}*6 ≈ 2.4545 ), ( frac{5}{11}*6 ≈ 2.727 ). So, ( a ) must be between ~2.4545 and ~2.727. So, ( a = 3 ). Check ( frac{3}{6} = 0.5 ), which is too big.For ( b = 7 ):( frac{9}{22}*7 ≈ 2.8636 ), ( frac{5}{11}*7 ≈ 3.1818 ). So, ( a ) must be between ~2.8636 and ~3.1818. So, ( a = 3 ). Check ( frac{3}{7} ≈ 0.4286 ), which is within the interval. So, that's the first valid ( a ) and ( b ) we've found with ( b = 7 ).Sum ( a + b = 10 ).Let me check ( b = 8 ):( frac{9}{22}*8 ≈ 3.2727 ), ( frac{5}{11}*8 ≈ 3.636 ). So, ( a ) must be between ~3.2727 and ~3.636. So, ( a = 4 ). Check ( frac{4}{8} = 0.5 ), which is too big.For ( b = 9 ):( frac{9}{22}*9 ≈ 3.6818 ), ( frac{5}{11}*9 ≈ 4.0909 ). So, ( a ) must be between ~3.6818 and ~4.0909. So, ( a = 4 ). Check ( frac{4}{9} ≈ 0.4444 ), which is within the interval. Sum ( a + b = 13 ), which is larger than 10.For ( b = 10 ):( frac{9}{22}*10 ≈ 4.0909 ), ( frac{5}{11}*10 ≈ 4.545 ). So, ( a ) must be between ~4.0909 and ~4.545. So, ( a = 5 ). Check ( frac{5}{10} = 0.5 ), which is too big.So, seems like ( b = 7 ) is the smallest denominator where such an ( a ) exists, giving ( frac{3}{7} ) with sum 10.But wait, let me check if there's a fraction with a smaller sum by considering ( a + b ) less than 10. For example, ( a + b = 9 ). So, possible ( b ) values from 1 to 8.Check each ( b ) from 1 to 8, see if ( a = 9 - b ) gives a fraction in the interval.For ( b = 1 ), ( a = 8 ): ( frac{8}{1} = 8 ), way too big.( b = 2 ), ( a = 7 ): ( frac{7}{2} = 3.5 ), too big.( b = 3 ), ( a = 6 ): ( frac{6}{3} = 2 ), too big.( b = 4 ), ( a = 5 ): ( frac{5}{4} = 1.25 ), too big.( b = 5 ), ( a = 4 ): ( frac{4}{5} = 0.8 ), too big.( b = 6 ), ( a = 3 ): ( frac{3}{6} = 0.5 ), too big.( b = 7 ), ( a = 2 ): ( frac{2}{7} ≈ 0.2857 ), too small.( b = 8 ), ( a = 1 ): ( frac{1}{8} = 0.125 ), too small.So, none of these give a fraction in the desired interval. So, ( a + b = 9 ) is impossible.Similarly, check ( a + b = 8 ):Possible ( b ) from 1 to 7.( b = 1 ), ( a = 7 ): 7, too big.( b = 2 ), ( a = 6 ): 3, too big.( b = 3 ), ( a = 5 ): ( frac{5}{3} ≈ 1.666 ), too big.( b = 4 ), ( a = 4 ): 1, too big.( b = 5 ), ( a = 3 ): ( frac{3}{5} = 0.6 ), too big.( b = 6 ), ( a = 2 ): ( frac{2}{6} ≈ 0.333 ), too small.( b = 7 ), ( a = 1 ): ( frac{1}{7} ≈ 0.1429 ), too small.So, nothing here either.Similarly, for ( a + b = 7 ):( b ) from 1 to 6.( b = 1 ), ( a = 6 ): 6, too big.( b = 2 ), ( a = 5 ): 2.5, too big.( b = 3 ), ( a = 4 ): ( frac{4}{3} ≈ 1.333 ), too big.( b = 4 ), ( a = 3 ): ( frac{3}{4} = 0.75 ), too big.( b = 5 ), ( a = 2 ): ( frac{2}{5} = 0.4 ), too small.( b = 6 ), ( a = 1 ): ( frac{1}{6} ≈ 0.1667 ), too small.So, no luck.Similarly, ( a + b = 6 ):( b ) from 1 to 5.( b = 1 ), ( a = 5 ): 5, too big.( b = 2 ), ( a = 4 ): 2, too big.( b = 3 ), ( a = 3 ): 1, too big.( b = 4 ), ( a = 2 ): ( frac{2}{4} = 0.5 ), too big.( b = 5 ), ( a = 1 ): ( frac{1}{5} = 0.2 ), too small.No good.Continuing this way, it's clear that ( a + b = 10 ) is indeed the smallest possible sum where such a fraction exists.Therefore, the fraction ( frac{3}{7} ) with ( a + b = 10 ) is the answer.**Final Answer**The fraction with the smallest possible sum ( a + b ) is boxed{dfrac{3}{7}}."},{"question":"John recently bought a used car for 5000 for his pizza delivery job.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can simplify the numerator first before dealing with the denominator. Looking at the numerator: (2sin 46^{circ} - sqrt{3}cos 74^{circ}). I wonder if I can express this as a single sine or cosine function using some trigonometric identities. I remember that expressions of the form (asintheta + bcostheta) can be written as (Rsin(theta + phi)) or (Rcos(theta + phi)), where (R = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}) and (phi) is some phase shift. Maybe I can apply that here.Let me try that. Let's consider the numerator as (asintheta + bcosphi), where (a = 2), (theta = 46^{circ}), (b = -sqrt{3}), and (phi = 74^{circ}). So, if I can write this as (Rsin(46^{circ} + phi)), that might help.First, let's compute (R):[R = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = sqrt{2^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{4 + 3} = sqrt{7}]Wait, but actually, since the coefficients are 2 and (-sqrt{3}), the formula would be:[R = sqrt{(2)^2 + (-sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{4 + 3} = sqrt{7}]Okay, so (R = sqrt{7}). Now, I need to find the angle (phi) such that:[sinphi = frac{b}{R} = frac{-sqrt{3}}{sqrt{7}} quad text{and} quad cosphi = frac{a}{R} = frac{2}{sqrt{7}}]Wait, hold on. Actually, the formula is:If (asintheta + bcostheta = Rsin(theta + phi)), then:[R = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}][sinphi = frac{b}{R}][cosphi = frac{a}{R}]But in our case, the angles are different: 46° and 74°. So maybe this approach isn't directly applicable because the angles aren't the same. Hmm, that complicates things.Alternatively, perhaps I can use sum or difference identities. Let me think about the angles involved. 46°, 74°, and 16°. I notice that 46° and 74° add up to 120°, which is a nice angle. Maybe that can be useful.Wait, 46° + 74° = 120°, which is 60° * 2. Hmm, 120° is a supplementary angle to 60°, so maybe that can be used in some identity.Alternatively, perhaps I can express 74° as 90° - 16°, since 90° - 16° = 74°. That might help because cosine of 74° is sine of 16°, right? Because (cos(90° - theta) = sintheta). So, (cos74° = sin16°). Let me write that down:[cos74° = sin16°]So, substituting that into the numerator:[2sin46° - sqrt{3}cos74° = 2sin46° - sqrt{3}sin16°]Hmm, now the numerator is (2sin46° - sqrt{3}sin16°). Maybe I can express this as a combination of sines with the same angle or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the sine of sum or difference identities.Wait, 46° is 30° + 16°, right? Because 30° + 16° = 46°. So, maybe I can express (sin46°) as (sin(30° + 16°)). Let me try that.Using the sine addition formula:[sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B]So, (sin46° = sin(30° + 16°) = sin30°cos16° + cos30°sin16°). Let's compute that:[sin30° = frac{1}{2}, quad cos30° = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}][sin46° = frac{1}{2}cos16° + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sin16°]So, substituting back into the numerator:[2sin46° = 2left( frac{1}{2}cos16° + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sin16° right) = cos16° + sqrt{3}sin16°]Therefore, the numerator becomes:[2sin46° - sqrt{3}sin16° = (cos16° + sqrt{3}sin16°) - sqrt{3}sin16° = cos16°]Wait, that's interesting! The (sqrt{3}sin16°) terms cancel out, leaving just (cos16°). So, the numerator simplifies to (cos16°). Therefore, the entire expression becomes:[frac{cos16°}{cos16°} = 1]So, the value of the expression is 1. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I recognized that (cos74° = sin16°), which seems correct because (cos(90° - theta) = sintheta).2. Then I expressed (sin46°) as (sin(30° + 16°)), which is valid.3. Applied the sine addition formula correctly, breaking it down into (sin30°cos16° + cos30°sin16°).4. Multiplied by 2, resulting in (cos16° + sqrt{3}sin16°).5. Subtracted (sqrt{3}sin16°) from that, leaving (cos16°).6. Divided by (cos16°), resulting in 1.Everything seems to check out. So, I think the value is indeed 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"Replace the odd numbers in Pascal's Triangle with 1 and the even numbers with 0 to obtain the 0-1 triangle number table as shown.

Then, I need to figure out two things: first, the nth row where all numbers are 1s, and second, the number of 1s in the 61st row. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.Starting with the basics, Pascal's Triangle is constructed by adding the two numbers above each number to get the number below them. The first few rows are all 1s, but as the rows get longer, the numbers in between start to change. When we replace odd numbers with 1s and even numbers with 0s, we're essentially creating a binary version of Pascal's Triangle. I remember that in this binary version, the rows correspond to the binary representations of numbers, but I'm not entirely sure how that ties into the problem.The problem mentions that the first row where all numbers are 1 is the 1st row, the second time is the 3rd row, and so on. So, it seems like every time we have a row where all numbers are 1, it's at a specific position. I need to find a pattern or a formula that can tell me the nth such row.Looking at the examples given:1st row: 1 1  2nd row: 1 0 1  3rd row: 1 1 1 1  4th row: 1 0 0 0 1  5th row: 1 1 0 0 1 1  ...So, the 1st row is all 1s, the 3rd row is all 1s, and I can see that the 7th row would probably be all 1s as well. Wait, that seems like powers of 2 minus 1. Let me check:Row 1: 2^1 - 1 = 1  Row 3: 2^2 - 1 = 3  Row 7: 2^3 - 1 = 7  Row 15: 2^4 - 1 = 15  ...Yes, that seems to be the pattern. So, the nth row where all numbers are 1 is 2^n - 1. Therefore, the nth such row is the (2^n - 1)th row. So, for example, the 1st time is row 1, the 2nd time is row 3, the 3rd time is row 7, and so on. That makes sense because in binary, these rows correspond to numbers that are all 1s, which are one less than powers of two.Okay, so that takes care of the first part: the nth row where all numbers are 1 is the (2^n - 1)th row. So, if the problem is asking for the nth row, I can express it as 2^n - 1. But wait, the problem says \\"the nth time all numbers in a row are 1 is the nth row,\\" which is a bit confusing. Wait, no, looking back, it says: \\"the first row where all numbers are 1 is the 1st row, the second time all numbers in a row are 1 is the 3rd row, ..., the nth time all numbers in a row are 1 is the boxed nth row.\\" So, actually, the nth occurrence is at row (2^n - 1). So, for example, when n=1, it's row 1; n=2, row 3; n=3, row 7, etc. So, the nth such row is row (2^n - 1). So, that's the first part.Now, the second part is the number of 1s in the 61st row. Hmm, okay. So, in the 61st row of this 0-1 triangle, how many 1s are there?I remember that in the binary version of Pascal's Triangle, the number of 1s in a row corresponds to 2 raised to the number of ones in the binary representation of the row number. Wait, let me think. So, if I take the row number, convert it to binary, count the number of 1s, and then raise 2 to that power, I get the number of 1s in that row.Wait, let me verify with the examples given:1st row: row number 1, which is 1 in binary. Number of 1s: 1. So, 2^1 = 2. But in the 1st row, we have two 1s, which matches.2nd row: row number 2, which is 10 in binary. Number of 1s: 1. So, 2^1 = 2. But in the 2nd row, we have three numbers: 1, 0, 1. So, two 1s. Hmm, that also matches.3rd row: row number 3, which is 11 in binary. Number of 1s: 2. So, 2^2 = 4. The 3rd row has four 1s, which is correct.4th row: row number 4, which is 100 in binary. Number of 1s: 1. So, 2^1 = 2. The 4th row has two 1s, which is correct.5th row: row number 5, which is 101 in binary. Number of 1s: 2. So, 2^2 = 4. The 5th row has four 1s, which is correct.Okay, so this seems to hold. Therefore, the number of 1s in the nth row is 2 raised to the number of 1s in the binary representation of n.So, for the 61st row, I need to find the number of 1s in its binary representation and then compute 2 raised to that power.First, let's convert 61 into binary.61 divided by 2 is 30 with a remainder of 1.30 divided by 2 is 15 with a remainder of 0.15 divided by 2 is 7 with a remainder of 1.7 divided by 2 is 3 with a remainder of 1.3 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of 1.1 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 1.So, writing the remainders from last to first: 111101.So, 61 in binary is 111101, which has four 1s.Therefore, the number of 1s in the 61st row is 2^4 = 16.Wait, let me double-check that.61 in binary: 64 is 1000000, so 61 is 64 - 3, which is 111101. Yes, that's correct. So, four 1s.Therefore, the number of 1s is 2^4 = 16.Wait, but in the 5th row, which is 101 in binary, which has two 1s, and indeed, the 5th row has four 1s, which is 2^2. So, that's consistent.Therefore, for the 61st row, the number of 1s is 16.So, summarizing:- The nth row where all numbers are 1 is the (2^n - 1)th row.- The number of 1s in the 61st row is 16.Therefore, the answers are:First part: 2^n - 1Second part: 16But wait, the problem says: \\"the nth time all numbers in a row are 1 is the nth row,\\" which is a bit confusing in wording. Wait, actually, looking back:\\"Counting from the top, the first row where all numbers are 1 is the 1st row, the second time all numbers in a row are 1 is the 3rd row, ..., the nth time all numbers in a row are 1 is the boxed{text{nth row}}; the number of 1s in the 61st row is boxed{text{number}}.\\"So, actually, the first blank is asking for the nth row where all numbers are 1, which is 2^n - 1, and the second blank is asking for the number of 1s in the 61st row, which is 16.Therefore, the answers should be:First box: 2^n - 1Second box: 16But let me make sure about the first part. The first occurrence is row 1, which is 2^1 - 1 = 1. The second occurrence is row 3, which is 2^2 - 1 = 3. The third occurrence is row 7, which is 2^3 - 1 = 7. So, yes, the nth occurrence is row (2^n - 1). So, that's correct.Therefore, I think I've got it.**Final Answer**The nth row is boxed{2^n - 1} and the number of 1s in the 61st row is boxed{16}."},{"question":"Each dandelion produces 300 seeds. 1/3rd of the seeds land in water and die. 1/6 of the starting number are eaten by insects. Half the remainder sprout and are immediately eaten. How many dandelions survive long enough to flower?","answer":"First, I note that each dandelion produces 300 seeds.Next, I calculate the number of seeds that land in water and die. Since 1/3 of the seeds are affected, this is 300 multiplied by 1/3, which equals 100 seeds.Then, I determine how many seeds are eaten by insects. 1/6 of the starting number are eaten, so 300 multiplied by 1/6 equals 50 seeds.After accounting for the seeds lost to water and insects, I subtract these from the total number of seeds. This leaves 300 minus 100 minus 50, which is 150 seeds remaining.Finally, I consider that half of the remaining seeds sprout and are immediately eaten. Therefore, half of 150 seeds, which is 75, survive long enough to flower."},{"question":"Given the inverse proportion function y=frac{k}{x} passes through the point left(2,6right), then k=____.","answer":"To find the value of ( k ) in the inverse proportion function ( y = frac{k}{x} ) that passes through the point ( (2, 6) ), I can substitute the coordinates of the point into the equation.First, substitute ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 6 ) into the equation:[6 = frac{k}{2}]Next, solve for ( k ) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:[k = 6 times 2 = 12]Therefore, the value of ( k ) is 12."},{"question":"How many natural-number factors does N have if N = 2^4 cdot 3^3 cdot 5^2 cdot 7^2?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find out how many natural-number factors the number N has, where N is given as 2^4 multiplied by 3^3 multiplied by 5^2 multiplied by 7^2. Hmm, okay. I remember something about prime factorization and exponents being related to the number of factors, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact method. Let me try to recall.First, I think the key here is that if a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to various exponents, there's a formula to find the total number of factors. I believe it's something like adding one to each of the exponents and then multiplying those together. Let me see if that makes sense.So, N is 2^4 * 3^3 * 5^2 * 7^2. Each of these primes has an exponent: 4, 3, 2, and 2 respectively. If I take each exponent, add one to it, and then multiply all those together, that should give me the total number of factors. Let me write that down.For the prime 2, the exponent is 4. Adding one gives 5. For prime 3, exponent 3, adding one gives 4. For prime 5, exponent 2, adding one gives 3. And for prime 7, exponent 2, adding one also gives 3. So, now I have 5, 4, 3, and 3.Now, multiplying these together: 5 * 4 is 20, then 20 * 3 is 60, and 60 * 3 is 180. So, does that mean N has 180 natural-number factors? That seems like a lot, but considering N is a product of several primes each raised to a power, it might actually be correct.Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Maybe I should break it down further. I remember that each factor of N can be represented as 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^d, where a, b, c, d are integers such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 4, 0 ≤ b ≤ 3, 0 ≤ c ≤ 2, and 0 ≤ d ≤ 2. So, for each prime, the exponent can range from 0 up to its maximum in N.Therefore, the number of choices for a is 5 (0 through 4), for b is 4 (0 through 3), for c is 3 (0 through 2), and for d is 3 (0 through 2). Since each choice is independent, the total number of factors is indeed 5 * 4 * 3 * 3. Let me compute that again: 5 * 4 is 20, 20 * 3 is 60, 60 * 3 is 180. So, 180 factors.Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can test this with a smaller number to see if the formula works. Let's take a simple number like 6, which is 2^1 * 3^1. According to the formula, the number of factors should be (1+1)*(1+1) = 2*2 = 4. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. Yep, that's four factors. So, the formula works here.Another example: 12, which is 2^2 * 3^1. The number of factors should be (2+1)*(1+1) = 3*2 = 6. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. That's six factors. Perfect, the formula holds.So, going back to our original problem, since the formula works for smaller numbers, it should work for N as well. Therefore, the number of natural-number factors of N is 180.But just to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error, let me compute 5 * 4 * 3 * 3 again step by step. 5 multiplied by 4 is 20. Then, 20 multiplied by 3 is 60. Finally, 60 multiplied by 3 is 180. Yep, that's consistent.I think I'm confident now. The number of natural-number factors of N is 180.**Final Answer**The number ( N ) has boxed{180} natural-number factors."},{"question":"Let (a, b, c) be real numbers such that[ 3ab + 2 = 6b, quad 3bc + 2 = 5c, quad 3ca + 2 = 4a. ]Suppose the only possible values for the product (abc) are (frac{r}{s}) and (frac{t}{u}), where (frac{r}{s}) and (frac{t}{u}) are both fractions in lowest terms. Find (r+s+t+u).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem with three equations involving a, b, and c. The equations are:1. (3ab + 2 = 6b)2. (3bc + 2 = 5c)3. (3ca + 2 = 4a)And I need to find the possible values of the product (abc). The answer should be in the form of two fractions, (frac{r}{s}) and (frac{t}{u}), and then find the sum (r + s + t + u).Hmm, okay. Let me start by trying to solve each equation for one variable in terms of another. Maybe I can express a in terms of b, then b in terms of c, and so on, and substitute them to find the product.Starting with the first equation: (3ab + 2 = 6b). Let me try to solve for a.Subtract 6b from both sides: (3ab - 6b + 2 = 0).Factor out 3b: (3b(a - 2) + 2 = 0).Wait, that might not be the most straightforward way. Maybe I should isolate a.Starting again: (3ab + 2 = 6b).Subtract 2 from both sides: (3ab = 6b - 2).Now, if I divide both sides by 3b, assuming b ≠ 0, I get:(a = frac{6b - 2}{3b}).Simplify that: (a = frac{6b}{3b} - frac{2}{3b} = 2 - frac{2}{3b}).Okay, so (a = 2 - frac{2}{3b}). Let me note that down.Moving on to the second equation: (3bc + 2 = 5c).Similarly, let's solve for b.Subtract 5c from both sides: (3bc - 5c + 2 = 0).Factor out c: (c(3b - 5) + 2 = 0).Alternatively, let's solve for b.Starting again: (3bc + 2 = 5c).Subtract 2: (3bc = 5c - 2).Assuming c ≠ 0, divide both sides by 3c:(b = frac{5c - 2}{3c}).Simplify: (b = frac{5c}{3c} - frac{2}{3c} = frac{5}{3} - frac{2}{3c}).So, (b = frac{5}{3} - frac{2}{3c}).Alright, moving to the third equation: (3ca + 2 = 4a).Let me solve for c.Subtract 4a from both sides: (3ca - 4a + 2 = 0).Factor out a: (a(3c - 4) + 2 = 0).Alternatively, solving for c:Starting again: (3ca + 2 = 4a).Subtract 2: (3ca = 4a - 2).Assuming a ≠ 0, divide both sides by 3a:(c = frac{4a - 2}{3a}).Simplify: (c = frac{4a}{3a} - frac{2}{3a} = frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{3a}).So, (c = frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{3a}).Now, I have expressions for a, b, and c in terms of each other:- (a = 2 - frac{2}{3b})- (b = frac{5}{3} - frac{2}{3c})- (c = frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{3a})This seems cyclic. Maybe I can substitute one into another.Let me try substituting the expression for c into the expression for b.From above, (b = frac{5}{3} - frac{2}{3c}).But (c = frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{3a}), so substitute that in:(b = frac{5}{3} - frac{2}{3 left( frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{3a} right)}).Let me simplify the denominator first:(3 left( frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{3a} right) = 4 - frac{2}{a}).So, (b = frac{5}{3} - frac{2}{4 - frac{2}{a}}).Simplify the fraction in the denominator:(frac{2}{4 - frac{2}{a}} = frac{2}{frac{4a - 2}{a}}} = frac{2a}{4a - 2} = frac{2a}{2(2a - 1)} = frac{a}{2a - 1}).So, (b = frac{5}{3} - frac{a}{2a - 1}).Now, let's write that as:(b = frac{5}{3} - frac{a}{2a - 1}).Now, remember that (a = 2 - frac{2}{3b}). So, let's substitute this expression for a into the equation for b.So, (b = frac{5}{3} - frac{2 - frac{2}{3b}}{2(2 - frac{2}{3b}) - 1}).This looks complicated, but let's take it step by step.First, compute the numerator of the second term:(2 - frac{2}{3b}).Then, compute the denominator:(2(2 - frac{2}{3b}) - 1 = 4 - frac{4}{3b} - 1 = 3 - frac{4}{3b}).So, the second term becomes:(frac{2 - frac{2}{3b}}{3 - frac{4}{3b}}).Let me write this as:(frac{2 - frac{2}{3b}}{3 - frac{4}{3b}} = frac{frac{6b - 2}{3b}}{frac{9b - 4}{3b}} = frac{6b - 2}{9b - 4}).So, (b = frac{5}{3} - frac{6b - 2}{9b - 4}).Now, let's write this equation:(b = frac{5}{3} - frac{6b - 2}{9b - 4}).Let me bring all terms to one side:(b + frac{6b - 2}{9b - 4} = frac{5}{3}).Multiply both sides by (9b - 4) to eliminate the denominator:(b(9b - 4) + (6b - 2) = frac{5}{3}(9b - 4)).Simplify each term:First term: (9b^2 - 4b).Second term: (6b - 2).Third term: (frac{5}{3} times 9b = 15b), and (frac{5}{3} times (-4) = -frac{20}{3}).So, putting it all together:(9b^2 - 4b + 6b - 2 = 15b - frac{20}{3}).Simplify the left side:(9b^2 + 2b - 2).Right side: (15b - frac{20}{3}).Bring all terms to the left:(9b^2 + 2b - 2 - 15b + frac{20}{3} = 0).Combine like terms:(9b^2 - 13b - 2 + frac{20}{3} = 0).Convert -2 to thirds: (-2 = -frac{6}{3}).So, (9b^2 - 13b - frac{6}{3} + frac{20}{3} = 9b^2 - 13b + frac{14}{3} = 0).Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:(27b^2 - 39b + 14 = 0).Now, we have a quadratic equation in b: (27b^2 - 39b + 14 = 0).Let me try to solve this quadratic equation.Quadratic formula: (b = frac{39 pm sqrt{(-39)^2 - 4 times 27 times 14}}{2 times 27}).Compute discriminant:(D = 39^2 - 4 times 27 times 14).Calculate 39^2: 39*39 = 1521.Calculate 4*27*14: 4*27=108, 108*14=1512.So, D = 1521 - 1512 = 9.So, sqrt(D) = 3.Thus, (b = frac{39 pm 3}{54}).Compute both possibilities:1. (b = frac{39 + 3}{54} = frac{42}{54} = frac{7}{9}).2. (b = frac{39 - 3}{54} = frac{36}{54} = frac{2}{3}).So, b can be (frac{7}{9}) or (frac{2}{3}).Now, let's find the corresponding a and c for each case.Case 1: (b = frac{7}{9}).From earlier, (a = 2 - frac{2}{3b}).Plug in b:(a = 2 - frac{2}{3 times frac{7}{9}} = 2 - frac{2}{frac{7}{3}} = 2 - frac{6}{7} = frac{14}{7} - frac{6}{7} = frac{8}{7}).So, a = (frac{8}{7}).Now, from the third equation, (c = frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{3a}).Plug in a:(c = frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{3 times frac{8}{7}} = frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{frac{24}{7}} = frac{4}{3} - frac{14}{24}).Simplify (frac{14}{24}) to (frac{7}{12}).So, (c = frac{4}{3} - frac{7}{12} = frac{16}{12} - frac{7}{12} = frac{9}{12} = frac{3}{4}).So, c = (frac{3}{4}).Therefore, in this case, a = (frac{8}{7}), b = (frac{7}{9}), c = (frac{3}{4}).Compute abc:(frac{8}{7} times frac{7}{9} times frac{3}{4}).Simplify:The 7s cancel, 8 and 4 simplify to 2 and 1, 3 and 9 simplify to 1 and 3.So, (frac{8}{7} times frac{7}{9} times frac{3}{4} = frac{2}{1} times frac{1}{3} = frac{2}{3}).So, abc = (frac{2}{3}).Case 2: (b = frac{2}{3}).Again, from (a = 2 - frac{2}{3b}):Plug in b:(a = 2 - frac{2}{3 times frac{2}{3}} = 2 - frac{2}{2} = 2 - 1 = 1).So, a = 1.Now, from (c = frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{3a}):Plug in a = 1:(c = frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{3 times 1} = frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{3} = frac{2}{3}).So, c = (frac{2}{3}).Therefore, in this case, a = 1, b = (frac{2}{3}), c = (frac{2}{3}).Compute abc:(1 times frac{2}{3} times frac{2}{3} = frac{4}{9}).So, abc = (frac{4}{9}).Thus, the possible values for abc are (frac{2}{3}) and (frac{4}{9}).Now, the problem states that these are the only possible values, so we have two fractions: (frac{2}{3}) and (frac{4}{9}).Both are already in lowest terms.So, r = 2, s = 3, t = 4, u = 9.Therefore, r + s + t + u = 2 + 3 + 4 + 9 = 18.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 2 + 3 + 4 + 9 is indeed 18, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in solving for a, b, c.In Case 1: b = 7/9, a = 8/7, c = 3/4. Then abc = (8/7)(7/9)(3/4) = (8/7)*(7/9) = 8/9, then 8/9*(3/4) = 24/36 = 2/3. That seems correct.In Case 2: b = 2/3, a = 1, c = 2/3. Then abc = 1*(2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9. That also seems correct.So, yeah, the two possible values are 2/3 and 4/9, so the sum is 2 + 3 + 4 + 9 = 18.**Final Answer**boxed{18}"},{"question":"1994 students line up in a row. They count off from 1 to 3 from the front to the back of the line. Then, they count off from 1 to 4 from the back to the front of the line. How many people in the row count off as 1 in both counts?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are 1994 students lined up in a row. They first count off from 1 to 3 from the front to the back. Then, they count off from 1 to 4 from the back to the front. I need to figure out how many people counted off as 1 in both counts. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand what it means to count off from 1 to 3 from the front. So, starting from the first student, they count 1, then the next student is 2, the next is 3, and then it repeats: 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, and so on. So, every third student from the front gets the number 1. Similarly, when they count off from 1 to 4 from the back, they start counting from the last student, going backwards. So, the last student is 1, the second last is 2, third last is 3, fourth last is 4, then it repeats: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. So, every fourth student from the back gets the number 1.I need to find the number of students who were counted as 1 in both counts. That means I need to find the students who are in positions that are multiples of 3 from the front and multiples of 4 from the back. So, essentially, I need to find positions that satisfy both conditions.Let me denote the position of a student from the front as ( n ). Since there are 1994 students, the positions from the front are 1 to 1994. The positions from the back would then be 1994 - n + 1. So, if a student is in position ( n ) from the front, they are in position ( 1994 - n + 1 = 1995 - n ) from the back.Now, for a student to be counted as 1 in the first count (from the front), ( n ) must be a multiple of 3. So, ( n = 3k ) for some integer ( k ). For the same student to be counted as 1 in the second count (from the back), their position from the back must be a multiple of 4. So, ( 1995 - n = 4m ) for some integer ( m ). So, substituting ( n = 3k ) into the second equation, we get:[ 1995 - 3k = 4m ]Which can be rearranged as:[ 3k + 4m = 1995 ]So, we have a linear Diophantine equation here. I need to find all pairs of integers ( (k, m) ) such that this equation holds, with the constraints that ( n = 3k ) must be between 1 and 1994, and ( m ) must be a positive integer as well.Let me try to solve this equation for ( k ) and ( m ). First, let's express ( m ) in terms of ( k ):[ 4m = 1995 - 3k ][ m = frac{1995 - 3k}{4} ]For ( m ) to be an integer, ( 1995 - 3k ) must be divisible by 4. So, ( 1995 - 3k equiv 0 mod 4 ). Let's compute ( 1995 mod 4 ):1995 divided by 4 is 498 with a remainder of 3, so ( 1995 equiv 3 mod 4 ).So, the equation becomes:[ 3 - 3k equiv 0 mod 4 ][ -3k equiv -3 mod 4 ]Multiplying both sides by -1:[ 3k equiv 3 mod 4 ]Divide both sides by 3. Since 3 and 4 are coprime, the inverse of 3 modulo 4 is 3, because ( 3 times 3 = 9 equiv 1 mod 4 ). So, multiplying both sides by 3:[ k equiv 3 times 3 mod 4 ][ k equiv 9 mod 4 ][ k equiv 1 mod 4 ]So, ( k ) must be congruent to 1 modulo 4. That means ( k = 4t + 1 ) for some integer ( t ).Substituting back into ( n = 3k ):[ n = 3(4t + 1) = 12t + 3 ]So, the positions ( n ) that satisfy both conditions are of the form ( 12t + 3 ).Now, I need to find all such ( n ) within the range 1 to 1994. So, let's find the possible values of ( t ).Starting with ( t = 0 ):[ n = 12(0) + 3 = 3 ]Next, ( t = 1 ):[ n = 12(1) + 3 = 15 ]And so on, until ( n ) is less than or equal to 1994.Let me find the maximum ( t ) such that ( 12t + 3 leq 1994 ).Subtract 3 from both sides:[ 12t leq 1991 ]Divide both sides by 12:[ t leq frac{1991}{12} ]Calculating that:1991 divided by 12 is 165 with a remainder of 11, since 12*165=1980 and 1991-1980=11. So, ( t leq 165.916... ). Since ( t ) must be an integer, the maximum value of ( t ) is 165.Therefore, ( t ) can take values from 0 to 165, inclusive. That gives us 166 values. But wait, let me verify.Wait, when ( t = 165 ):[ n = 12*165 + 3 = 1980 + 3 = 1983 ]Which is less than 1994. The next value, ( t = 166 ):[ n = 12*166 + 3 = 1992 + 3 = 1995 ]Which is greater than 1994, so indeed, ( t ) can only go up to 165.Therefore, the number of such students is 166.But wait, let me double-check my calculations because 166 seems a bit high. Let me recount.We have ( n = 12t + 3 ), starting at t=0: n=3, t=1:15, ..., t=165:1983. So, how many terms is that?It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 3, with a common difference of 12, up to 1983.The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is:[ text{Number of terms} = left( frac{text{Last term} - text{First term}}{text{Common difference}} right) + 1 ]Plugging in the numbers:[ frac{1983 - 3}{12} + 1 = frac{1980}{12} + 1 = 165 + 1 = 166 ]Yes, that seems correct. So, there are 166 students who are counted as 1 in both counts.Wait, but let me think again. The total number of students is 1994. So, if we have 166 students counted as 1 in both counts, does that make sense?Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the modulus calculation earlier. Let me go back.We had:[ 3k equiv 3 mod 4 ]Which simplifies to:[ k equiv 1 mod 4 ]So, k = 4t + 1, which leads to n = 12t + 3. So, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I should think about the positions from the front and back.Another approach: Let me denote the position from the front as n, and the position from the back as m. So, n + m = 1995, since the first student from the front is the 1994th from the back, and so on.We want n ≡ 1 mod 3 and m ≡ 1 mod 4.So, n ≡ 1 mod 3, and m = 1995 - n ≡ 1 mod 4.So, substituting m:1995 - n ≡ 1 mod 4Which gives:-n ≡ 1 - 1995 mod 41995 mod 4 is 3, so:-n ≡ 1 - 3 mod 4-n ≡ -2 mod 4Multiply both sides by -1:n ≡ 2 mod 4So, n must satisfy both n ≡ 1 mod 3 and n ≡ 2 mod 4.So, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem here.Find n such that:n ≡ 1 mod 3n ≡ 2 mod 4Let me solve these congruences.Let n = 4k + 2. Substitute into the first equation:4k + 2 ≡ 1 mod 34k ≡ -1 mod 3But 4 ≡ 1 mod 3, so:k ≡ -1 mod 3Which is the same as:k ≡ 2 mod 3So, k = 3m + 2 for some integer m.Therefore, n = 4*(3m + 2) + 2 = 12m + 8 + 2 = 12m + 10.Wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Earlier, I had n = 12t + 3, but now I have n = 12m + 10.Hmm, that suggests a discrepancy. Let me check my steps.In the first approach, I set n = 3k, and then found that k ≡ 1 mod 4, leading to n = 12t + 3.In the second approach, I set n ≡ 1 mod 3 and n ≡ 2 mod 4, leading to n = 12m + 10.These two results should be consistent, but they aren't. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.Wait, in the first approach, I considered n = 3k, but in the second approach, I considered n ≡ 1 mod 3 and n ≡ 2 mod 4. So, perhaps the first approach was incorrect because n = 3k implies n ≡ 0 mod 3, but in the second approach, n ≡ 1 mod 3. So, there's a conflict here.Wait, that's a critical mistake. In the first approach, I assumed n = 3k, meaning n is a multiple of 3, i.e., n ≡ 0 mod 3. But in reality, the first count is 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3,... So, the students who get 1 are at positions 1, 4, 7, 10, etc. So, n ≡ 1 mod 3, not n ≡ 0 mod 3.Oh! That's where I messed up. I incorrectly assumed that n = 3k, but actually, the first count assigns 1 to n ≡ 1 mod 3, not n ≡ 0 mod 3.So, that changes everything. Let's correct that.So, in the first count, the students counted as 1 are at positions n where n ≡ 1 mod 3.Similarly, in the second count, the students counted as 1 from the back are at positions m where m ≡ 1 mod 4. But since m = 1995 - n, we have 1995 - n ≡ 1 mod 4, which simplifies to n ≡ 1995 - 1 mod 4, which is n ≡ 1994 mod 4. Since 1994 divided by 4 is 498 with a remainder of 2, so 1994 ≡ 2 mod 4. Therefore, n ≡ 2 mod 4.So, the correct system of congruences is:n ≡ 1 mod 3n ≡ 2 mod 4Now, let's solve this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.Let n = 4k + 2. Substitute into the first equation:4k + 2 ≡ 1 mod 34k ≡ -1 mod 3Since 4 ≡ 1 mod 3, this simplifies to:k ≡ -1 mod 3Which is equivalent to:k ≡ 2 mod 3Therefore, k = 3m + 2 for some integer m.Substituting back into n:n = 4*(3m + 2) + 2 = 12m + 8 + 2 = 12m + 10So, n = 12m + 10.Therefore, the positions n that satisfy both conditions are of the form 12m + 10.Now, let's find the range of m such that n is between 1 and 1994.Starting with m = 0:n = 12*0 + 10 = 10Next, m = 1:n = 12*1 + 10 = 22And so on, until n ≤ 1994.Let's find the maximum m such that 12m + 10 ≤ 1994.Subtract 10:12m ≤ 1984Divide by 12:m ≤ 1984 / 12 ≈ 165.333...So, m can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 165.Therefore, the number of such m is 166.Wait, but let me check when m = 165:n = 12*165 + 10 = 1980 + 10 = 1990Which is less than 1994. The next value, m = 166:n = 12*166 + 10 = 1992 + 10 = 2002, which is greater than 1994. So, m can only go up to 165.Therefore, the number of students is 166.Wait, but earlier, when I incorrectly set n = 3k, I got 166 as well, but that was a mistake. Now, after correcting, I still get 166. So, is 166 the correct answer?Wait, let me verify with another approach.Total number of students counted as 1 from the front: Since they count 1 every 3 students, the number is floor(1994 / 3) = 664 (since 3*664=1992, and 1994-1992=2, so 664 full cycles).Similarly, the number of students counted as 1 from the back: Since they count 1 every 4 students, starting from the back. The number is floor(1994 / 4) = 498 (since 4*498=1992, and 1994-1992=2, so 498 full cycles).But we need the overlap, i.e., students counted as 1 in both counts. So, the number of students who are counted as 1 in both counts is equal to the number of students who are at positions that are 1 mod 3 from the front and 1 mod 4 from the back, which we found to be 166.Alternatively, since the positions are n ≡ 1 mod 3 and n ≡ 2 mod 4, which gives n ≡ 10 mod 12. So, the positions are 10, 22, 34, ..., up to the maximum less than or equal to 1994.The number of terms in this sequence is given by:Number of terms = floor((1994 - 10)/12) + 1 = floor(1984/12) + 1 = 165 + 1 = 166.So, that confirms it again.Therefore, the number of students who counted off as 1 in both counts is 166.But wait, let me check with an example with smaller numbers to see if my approach is correct.Suppose there are 12 students.Counting from front: 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3. So, positions 1,4,7,10 are counted as 1.Counting from back: 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4. So, positions 12,8,4,0 (but 0 doesn't exist, so only 12,8,4).Wait, in 12 students, counting from the back as 1,2,3,4,... So, position 12 is 1, 11 is 2, 10 is 3, 9 is 4, 8 is 1, 7 is 2, 6 is 3, 5 is 4, 4 is 1, 3 is 2, 2 is 3, 1 is 4.Wait, so positions counted as 1 from the back are 12,8,4.So, overlapping positions counted as 1 in both counts are 4 and 10? Wait, no.Wait, from front: 1,4,7,10.From back: 4,8,12.So, overlapping positions are 4.Wait, but according to my formula, n ≡ 1 mod 3 and n ≡ 2 mod 4.So, solving n ≡1 mod3 and n≡2 mod4.n=10: 10 mod3=1, 10 mod4=2. So, 10 is a solution.n=4: 4 mod3=1, 4 mod4=0. So, 4 is not a solution because n≡0 mod4, but we need n≡2 mod4.Wait, so in 12 students, the overlapping position is only 10.But according to my formula, n=10 is the only solution in 12 students.But when I count manually, from front:1,4,7,10; from back:4,8,12. So, overlapping is only 4? Wait, no, 4 is counted as 1 from front and 1 from back? Wait, no.Wait, position 4: from front, it's 1 (since 4 mod3=1). From back, position 4 is counted as 1? Wait, let's see.In 12 students, position 4 from front is 4. From back, position 4 is counted as 1 because 12 -4 +1=9, which is position 9 from front. Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the counts.Wait, when counting from the back, the first student (position 12 from front) is 1, position 11 is 2, position 10 is 3, position 9 is 4, position 8 is 1, position 7 is 2, position 6 is 3, position 5 is 4, position 4 is 1, position 3 is 2, position 2 is 3, position 1 is 4.So, the positions counted as 1 from the back are 12,8,4.So, position 4 is counted as 1 from the back, and position 4 is also counted as 1 from the front because 4 mod3=1.So, position 4 is an overlapping position.Similarly, position 10: from front, 10 mod3=1, so counted as 1. From back, position 10 is counted as 3 (since 12 -10 +1=3). So, position 10 is not counted as 1 from the back.Wait, so in 12 students, the overlapping position is only 4.But according to my formula, n=10 is a solution, but in reality, it's not. So, my formula is incorrect.Wait, that suggests a problem with my earlier reasoning.Wait, let's re-examine.We have n ≡1 mod3 and n ≡2 mod4.In the case of n=4: 4 mod3=1, 4 mod4=0. So, n=4 is 1 mod3 and 0 mod4, which does not satisfy n≡2 mod4.Wait, so my earlier conclusion that n=10 is a solution is correct, but in the case of 12 students, n=10 is beyond the range? Wait, no, 12 students, n=10 is within the range.Wait, in 12 students, n=10 is position 10 from front, which is counted as 1 from front (10 mod3=1), and from back, position 10 is counted as 3 (since 12 -10 +1=3). So, n=10 is counted as 1 from front and 3 from back, so it's not overlapping.Wait, so in 12 students, the only overlapping position is n=4, which is counted as 1 from front and 1 from back.But according to my formula, n=10 is a solution, which in reality, it's not. So, my formula is wrong.Wait, so where did I go wrong?Earlier, I set up the system:n ≡1 mod3n ≡2 mod4But in reality, when counting from the back, the position m=1995 -n must be ≡1 mod4.So, m=1995 -n ≡1 mod4Therefore, 1995 -n ≡1 mod4Which implies n ≡1995 -1 mod41995 mod4=3, so 1995 -1=1994≡2 mod4.Therefore, n≡2 mod4.So, n must satisfy n≡1 mod3 and n≡2 mod4.So, solving these, we get n=12m +10.But in the case of 12 students, n=10 is a solution, but in reality, it's not overlapping.Wait, so perhaps my mistake is in the modulus calculation.Wait, in the case of 12 students, n=10 is counted as 1 from front, but from back, it's counted as 3, not 1.So, n=10 is not an overlapping position.But according to the formula, n=10 is a solution. So, that suggests that my formula is incorrect.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the modulus calculation.Wait, let's go back.We have:From front: n ≡1 mod3From back: m=1995 -n ≡1 mod4So, 1995 -n ≡1 mod4Therefore, n ≡1995 -1 mod41995 mod4=3, so 1995 -1=1994≡2 mod4Therefore, n≡2 mod4So, n must satisfy n≡1 mod3 and n≡2 mod4.So, solving these, we get n=12m +10.But in the case of 12 students, n=10 is a solution, but in reality, it's not overlapping.Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the case of 12 students, the counts from the back are 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4.So, position 10 from front is position 3 from back, which is counted as 3, not 1.So, n=10 is not a solution.But according to the formula, n=10 is a solution because n=10≡1 mod3 and n=10≡2 mod4.Wait, but in reality, n=10 is not overlapping.So, perhaps my formula is correct, but in the case of 12 students, the overlapping position is n=4, which is 4≡1 mod3 and 4≡0 mod4, which does not satisfy n≡2 mod4.Wait, that's confusing.Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the modulus.Wait, in the case of 12 students, the overlapping position is n=4, which is 1 mod3 and 0 mod4.But according to our earlier reasoning, n must be 2 mod4.So, perhaps my initial setup is wrong.Wait, let's re-examine.When counting from the back, the first student (position 12 from front) is counted as 1, position 11 as 2, position 10 as 3, position 9 as 4, position 8 as 1, etc.So, the positions counted as 1 from the back are 12,8,4.So, these positions correspond to n=12,8,4 from front.So, n=12: 12 mod3=0, which is not 1 mod3.n=8:8 mod3=2, which is not 1 mod3.n=4:4 mod3=1, which is 1 mod3.So, only n=4 is overlapping.So, in this case, n=4 is the only overlapping position.But according to my formula, n=10 is a solution, but in reality, it's not.So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.Wait, let's re-examine the setup.From front: n ≡1 mod3From back: m=1995 -n ≡1 mod4So, 1995 -n ≡1 mod4Therefore, n ≡1995 -1 mod41995 mod4=3, so 1995 -1=1994≡2 mod4Therefore, n≡2 mod4So, n must satisfy n≡1 mod3 and n≡2 mod4.So, solving these, n=12m +10.But in the case of 12 students, n=10 is a solution, but in reality, it's not overlapping.Wait, perhaps the issue is that in the case of 12 students, n=10 is beyond the range where m=1995 -n is still positive.Wait, no, in 12 students, n=10 is valid, but m=1995 -n=1995-10=1985, which is way beyond 12. Wait, that doesn't make sense.Wait, no, in the case of 12 students, m=13 -n.Wait, because total students are 12, so m=12 -n +1=13 -n.So, in the 12-student example, m=13 -n.So, for n=10, m=13 -10=3.So, m=3, which is counted as 3 from the back, not 1.So, n=10 is not a solution.But according to the formula, n=10 is a solution because n≡1 mod3 and n≡2 mod4.So, the formula is giving a false positive.Therefore, my approach is flawed.Wait, perhaps I need to consider that m must be ≡1 mod4, but m=13 -n.So, in the 12-student case, m=13 -n ≡1 mod4So, 13 -n ≡1 mod4Therefore, n ≡13 -1 mod4=12 mod4=0 mod4So, n≡0 mod4But from front, n≡1 mod3So, solving n≡1 mod3 and n≡0 mod4.So, n=12m +4.Wait, let's solve this:n=4k4k ≡1 mod34≡1 mod3, so k≡1 mod3Thus, k=3m +1Therefore, n=4*(3m +1)=12m +4So, n=4,16,28,...In the case of 12 students, n=4 is a solution.Which matches our manual count.So, in the 12-student case, the overlapping position is n=4.So, in that case, the formula is n=12m +4.But in the original problem, we have n≡1 mod3 and n≡2 mod4.Wait, so why in the 12-student case, it's n≡1 mod3 and n≡0 mod4, but in the original problem, it's n≡1 mod3 and n≡2 mod4.Wait, that's because in the original problem, total students=1994, so m=1995 -n.In the 12-student case, m=13 -n.So, in the original problem, 1995 -n ≡1 mod4 => n≡1995 -1 mod4=1994 mod4=2 mod4.In the 12-student case, 13 -n ≡1 mod4 => n≡13 -1 mod4=12 mod4=0 mod4.So, the modulus depends on the total number of students.Therefore, in the original problem, n≡2 mod4.In the 12-student case, n≡0 mod4.So, in the original problem, the overlapping positions are n≡1 mod3 and n≡2 mod4, leading to n=12m +10.But in the 12-student case, n≡1 mod3 and n≡0 mod4, leading to n=12m +4.So, in the original problem, the formula is n=12m +10.But in the 12-student case, n=12m +4.So, the formula depends on the total number of students.Therefore, in the original problem, the overlapping positions are n=12m +10, starting from m=0.So, n=10,22,34,..., up to the maximum less than or equal to 1994.So, let's calculate how many such n exist.First term:10, last term: let's find the largest n=12m +10 ≤1994.12m +10 ≤199412m ≤1984m ≤1984/12=165.333...So, m=0 to165, inclusive.Number of terms=166.But in the 12-student case, n=4 is the only solution, which is 12*0 +4=4.So, that works.Therefore, in the original problem, the number of overlapping positions is 166.But in the 12-student case, it's 1.So, seems consistent.Therefore, the answer should be 166.But wait, let me check with another small example.Suppose there are 24 students.From front: positions 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22 counted as 1.From back: positions 24,20,16,12,8,4 counted as 1.Overlapping positions:4,16.So, two overlapping positions.According to the formula, n=12m +10.In 24 students, n=10 and n=22.But in reality, overlapping positions are 4 and16.Wait, so discrepancy again.Wait, in 24 students, total students=24.So, m=25 -n.From back, m=25 -n ≡1 mod4.So, 25 -n ≡1 mod4 => n≡25 -1=24≡0 mod4.So, n≡0 mod4.From front, n≡1 mod3.So, solving n≡1 mod3 and n≡0 mod4.So, n=12m +4.Thus, n=4,16,28,...In 24 students, n=4 and16.So, two overlapping positions.But according to the formula n=12m +10, n=10,22, which are not overlapping.So, in this case, the formula n=12m +10 is incorrect.Therefore, my earlier conclusion is wrong.Wait, so what's the correct approach?It seems that in the original problem, the modulus depends on the total number of students.In the original problem, total students=1994.So, m=1995 -n.From back, m≡1 mod4.So, 1995 -n ≡1 mod4 => n≡1994 mod4=2 mod4.From front, n≡1 mod3.So, solving n≡1 mod3 and n≡2 mod4.Which gives n=12m +10.But in the 24-student case, total students=24, so m=25 -n.From back, m≡1 mod4 =>25 -n≡1 mod4 =>n≡24 mod4=0 mod4.From front, n≡1 mod3.So, solving n≡1 mod3 and n≡0 mod4.Which gives n=12m +4.So, in the original problem, the formula is n=12m +10, but in the 24-student case, it's n=12m +4.Therefore, the formula depends on the total number of students.So, in the original problem, since total students=1994, which is even, and 1995 is odd, the modulus is different.Wait, perhaps the key is that when total students N is such that N+1 is congruent to something mod4.Wait, in the original problem, N=1994, so N+1=1995.1995 mod4=3.So, 1995 -n ≡1 mod4 =>n≡1994 mod4=2 mod4.In the 24-student case, N=24, N+1=25.25 mod4=1.So, 25 -n ≡1 mod4 =>n≡24 mod4=0 mod4.So, depending on N+1 mod4, the congruence for n changes.Therefore, in the original problem, since N+1=1995≡3 mod4, we have n≡2 mod4.In the 24-student case, N+1=25≡1 mod4, so n≡0 mod4.So, the formula for n is:If N+1 ≡1 mod4, then n≡0 mod4.If N+1≡2 mod4, then n≡1 mod4.If N+1≡3 mod4, then n≡2 mod4.If N+1≡0 mod4, then n≡3 mod4.But in our case, N+1=1995≡3 mod4, so n≡2 mod4.Therefore, the formula is n=12m +10.But in the 24-student case, N+1=25≡1 mod4, so n≡0 mod4, leading to n=12m +4.Therefore, in the original problem, the formula is correct, and the number of overlapping positions is 166.But in the 24-student case, the formula gives n=10,22, which are beyond the overlapping positions, but in reality, overlapping positions are n=4,16.Wait, but in the 24-student case, n=10 is counted as 1 from front, but from back, n=10 is m=15, which is 15 mod4=3, so counted as 3, not 1.Similarly, n=22 is counted as 1 from front, but from back, n=22 is m=3, which is counted as 3, not 1.So, in the 24-student case, the formula n=12m +10 gives positions that are not overlapping, but the correct overlapping positions are n=4,16, which are given by n=12m +4.So, in the original problem, the formula n=12m +10 is correct because N+1=1995≡3 mod4, leading to n≡2 mod4.Therefore, the number of overlapping positions is 166.But in the 24-student case, the formula is different because N+1=25≡1 mod4, leading to n≡0 mod4.Therefore, in the original problem, the answer is 166.But wait, let me check with another example.Suppose N=7 students.From front:1,4,7 counted as 1.From back:7,4,1 counted as 1.Overlapping positions:1,4,7.Wait, but according to the formula:N=7, N+1=8≡0 mod4.So, n≡3 mod4.From front, n≡1 mod3.So, solving n≡1 mod3 and n≡3 mod4.n=12m +7.In 7 students, n=7 is a solution.But overlapping positions are 1,4,7.Wait, n=1:1≡1 mod3, and from back, m=8-1=7≡3 mod4≠1.Wait, n=1 is counted as 1 from front, but from back, it's counted as 7, which is 3 mod4, not 1.Similarly, n=4:4≡1 mod3, and from back, m=8-4=4≡0 mod4≠1.n=7:7≡1 mod3, and from back, m=8-7=1≡1 mod4.So, only n=7 is overlapping.But according to the formula, n=12m +7, which in 7 students is only n=7.So, that's correct.Therefore, in the original problem, the formula is correct, and the number of overlapping positions is 166.Therefore, the answer is 166."},{"question":"Calculate: 20062006 times 2007 + 20072007 times 2008 - 2006 times 20072007 - 2007 times 20082008 = quad .","answer":"Alright, so I have this math problem here: Calculate: (20062006 times 2007 + 20072007 times 2008 - 2006 times 20072007 - 2007 times 20082008).Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, I notice that all the numbers involved are pretty large, but maybe there's a pattern or a way to factor them to make the calculation easier. Let me write down each term separately:1. (20062006 times 2007)2. (20072007 times 2008)3. (-2006 times 20072007)4. (-2007 times 20082008)Looking at these terms, I see that some of them have similar structures. For example, (20062006) and (20072007) look like they might be multiples of 1001 or something similar. Let me check:- (20062006) divided by 1001: 20062006 ÷ 1001. Let me compute that. 1001 × 20060 is 20060 × 1001 = 20060 × 1000 + 20060 × 1 = 20060000 + 20060 = 20080060. Hmm, that's higher than 20062006. Maybe it's 2006 × 10001? Let me try that. 2006 × 10001 is 2006 × 10000 + 2006 × 1 = 20060000 + 2006 = 20062006. Oh, that works! So, (20062006 = 2006 times 10001).Similarly, (20072007) would be (2007 times 10001). Let me verify: 2007 × 10000 = 20070000, plus 2007 × 1 = 2007, so 20070000 + 2007 = 20072007. Perfect!What about (20082008)? That should be (2008 times 10001). Let me check: 2008 × 10000 = 20080000, plus 2008 × 1 = 2008, so 20080000 + 2008 = 20082008. Yep, that's correct.So, substituting these back into the original expression, we have:(2006 times 10001 times 2007 + 2007 times 10001 times 2008 - 2006 times 2007 times 10001 - 2007 times 2008 times 10001).Wait, hold on, let me make sure I substituted correctly. The original terms were:1. (20062006 times 2007 = 2006 times 10001 times 2007)2. (20072007 times 2008 = 2007 times 10001 times 2008)3. (-2006 times 20072007 = -2006 times 2007 times 10001)4. (-2007 times 20082008 = -2007 times 2008 times 10001)So, substituting, the entire expression becomes:(2006 times 10001 times 2007 + 2007 times 10001 times 2008 - 2006 times 2007 times 10001 - 2007 times 2008 times 10001).Hmm, interesting. So, all four terms have a factor of 10001. Let me factor that out:(10001 times [2006 times 2007 + 2007 times 2008 - 2006 times 2007 - 2007 times 2008]).Wait, let me write that correctly. Each term is multiplied by 10001, so factoring that out, we have:(10001 times (2006 times 2007 + 2007 times 2008 - 2006 times 2007 - 2007 times 2008)).Now, let's look at the expression inside the brackets:(2006 times 2007 + 2007 times 2008 - 2006 times 2007 - 2007 times 2008).Hmm, I see that the first term is (2006 times 2007) and the third term is (-2006 times 2007). So, they cancel each other out. Similarly, the second term is (2007 times 2008) and the fourth term is (-2007 times 2008), which also cancel each other out.So, the entire expression inside the brackets becomes 0. Therefore, the entire original expression is (10001 times 0 = 0).Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I recognized that numbers like 20062006 can be factored as 2006 × 10001. That seems correct because 20062006 ÷ 2006 = 10001. Similarly for the others.2. Substituted each term accordingly, which gave me four terms each with a factor of 10001.3. Factored out 10001, leaving the rest inside the brackets.4. Inside the brackets, the terms paired up and canceled each other: (2006 times 2007 - 2006 times 2007 = 0), and (2007 times 2008 - 2007 times 2008 = 0).So, yes, that seems correct. The entire expression simplifies to zero.But just to be thorough, let me compute each term individually without factoring to see if I get the same result.First term: (20062006 times 2007). Let me compute that.But wait, 20062006 × 2007 is a huge number. Maybe I can compute it as (2006 × 10001) × 2007 = 2006 × 2007 × 10001.Similarly, the second term: 20072007 × 2008 = (2007 × 10001) × 2008 = 2007 × 2008 × 10001.Third term: -2006 × 20072007 = -2006 × (2007 × 10001) = -2006 × 2007 × 10001.Fourth term: -2007 × 20082008 = -2007 × (2008 × 10001) = -2007 × 2008 × 10001.So, when I add all these up:2006 × 2007 × 10001 + 2007 × 2008 × 10001 - 2006 × 2007 × 10001 - 2007 × 2008 × 10001.Again, the first and third terms cancel, as do the second and fourth terms, leaving 0.So, both methods lead me to the same conclusion. Therefore, the result is indeed 0.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was recognizing the pattern in the numbers and factoring out the common term, which simplified the expression significantly.**Final Answer**boxed{0}"},{"question":"Observe the sequence: (1), (4, 7), (10, 13, 16), (19, 22, 25, 28), ..., then 2008 is in the boxed{text{th}} group.","answer":"Okay, so I have this sequence here: (1), (4, 7), (10, 13, 16), (19, 22, 25, 28), and so on. I need to figure out which group the number 2008 is in. Hmm, let's see.First, I notice that each group has an increasing number of elements. The first group has 1 number, the second has 2, the third has 3, the fourth has 4, and so on. So, the nth group has n numbers. That seems consistent.Looking at the numbers themselves, they seem to be increasing by 3 each time. Let me check:- First group: 1- Second group: 4, 7 (difference of 3)- Third group: 10, 13, 16 (difference of 3)- Fourth group: 19, 22, 25, 28 (difference of 3)Yep, each number increases by 3 from the previous one. So, the entire sequence is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3.But the grouping complicates things a bit. Each group starts at a certain number and then adds 3 each time. So, the first number of each group must follow its own pattern.Let me list out the starting numbers of each group:- Group 1: 1- Group 2: 4- Group 3: 10- Group 4: 19- ...Hmm, let's see the differences between these starting numbers:- From Group 1 to Group 2: 4 - 1 = 3- From Group 2 to Group 3: 10 - 4 = 6- From Group 3 to Group 4: 19 - 10 = 9So, the starting numbers increase by 3, then 6, then 9... which is 3 times 1, 3 times 2, 3 times 3, etc. So, each time, the increment increases by 3.That suggests that the starting number of the nth group can be expressed as the sum of these increments plus the initial number. Let me formalize this.Let’s denote the starting number of the nth group as S(n). Then,S(1) = 1S(2) = S(1) + 3*1 = 1 + 3 = 4S(3) = S(2) + 3*2 = 4 + 6 = 10S(4) = S(3) + 3*3 = 10 + 9 = 19S(5) = S(4) + 3*4 = 19 + 12 = 31And so on.So, in general, S(n) = S(n-1) + 3*(n-1)This is a recursive formula. To find a closed-form expression, let's expand it:S(n) = 1 + 3*(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1))Because each time, we're adding 3 times the previous term's index.The sum inside the parentheses is the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers, which is given by (n-1)*n/2.So, substituting that in:S(n) = 1 + 3*( (n-1)*n / 2 )Simplify that:S(n) = 1 + (3n(n - 1))/2So, that's the starting number of the nth group.Now, each group has n numbers, each increasing by 3. So, the numbers in the nth group are:S(n), S(n) + 3, S(n) + 6, ..., up to n terms.Therefore, the last number in the nth group is S(n) + 3*(n - 1)Let me compute that:Last(n) = S(n) + 3*(n - 1) = [1 + (3n(n - 1))/2] + 3n - 3Simplify:= 1 + (3n(n - 1))/2 + 3n - 3Combine constants: 1 - 3 = -2Combine terms with n:(3n(n - 1))/2 + 3n = (3n^2 - 3n)/2 + (6n)/2 = (3n^2 - 3n + 6n)/2 = (3n^2 + 3n)/2So, Last(n) = (3n^2 + 3n)/2 - 2Wait, let me check that again:Wait, S(n) = 1 + (3n(n - 1))/2Then, Last(n) = S(n) + 3*(n - 1) = 1 + (3n(n - 1))/2 + 3n - 3So, 1 - 3 = -2Then, (3n(n - 1))/2 + 3nLet me factor 3n:= 3n [ (n - 1)/2 + 1 ]= 3n [ (n - 1 + 2)/2 ]= 3n [ (n + 1)/2 ]= (3n(n + 1))/2So, Last(n) = (3n(n + 1))/2 - 2Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when n=1, Last(1) should be 1.Let me plug n=1 into Last(n):(3*1*2)/2 - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1. Okay, that works.n=2: (3*2*3)/2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7. Correct, since the second group ends at 7.n=3: (3*3*4)/2 - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16. Correct, third group ends at 16.n=4: (3*4*5)/2 - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28. Correct, fourth group ends at 28.Okay, so the formula for the last number in the nth group is:Last(n) = (3n(n + 1))/2 - 2So, now, we need to find the smallest n such that Last(n) >= 2008.In other words, solve for n in:(3n(n + 1))/2 - 2 >= 2008Let me write that inequality:(3n(n + 1))/2 - 2 >= 2008Add 2 to both sides:(3n(n + 1))/2 >= 2010Multiply both sides by 2:3n(n + 1) >= 4020Divide both sides by 3:n(n + 1) >= 1340So, we need to find the smallest integer n such that n(n + 1) >= 1340.This is a quadratic inequality. Let's solve n^2 + n - 1340 >= 0.Using the quadratic formula:n = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*1340) ] / 2Compute discriminant:sqrt(1 + 5360) = sqrt(5361)Compute sqrt(5361):Well, 73^2 = 5329, 74^2=5476. So, sqrt(5361) is between 73 and 74.Compute 73^2 = 53295361 - 5329 = 32So, sqrt(5361) ≈ 73 + 32/(2*73) ≈ 73 + 16/73 ≈ 73.22So, n ≈ [ -1 + 73.22 ] / 2 ≈ 72.22 / 2 ≈ 36.11So, n ≈ 36.11Since n must be an integer, and we need n(n + 1) >= 1340, so n=36:36*37=1332 <1340n=37:37*38=1406 >=1340So, n=37 is the smallest integer satisfying the inequality.Therefore, the last number in the 37th group is:Last(37) = (3*37*38)/2 - 2 = (3*703)/2 - 2 = 2109/2 - 2 = 1054.5 - 2 = 1052.5Wait, that can't be right because 2008 is way larger than 1052.5.Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.Wait, let me go back.Wait, earlier, I had:Last(n) = (3n(n + 1))/2 - 2But when n=37, that gives:(3*37*38)/2 - 2 = (3*1406)/2 - 2 = (4218)/2 - 2 = 2109 - 2 = 2107Ah, okay, I must have miscalculated earlier.So, Last(37)=2107Similarly, Last(36)= (3*36*37)/2 -2 = (3*1332)/2 -2= 1998 -2=1996So, the 36th group ends at 1996, and the 37th group starts at S(37)=1 + 3*(37*36)/2=1 + 3*(666)=1 + 1998=1999Wait, that makes sense because the last number of the 36th group is 1996, so the next number is 1999, which is the start of the 37th group.So, the 37th group starts at 1999 and has 37 numbers, each increasing by 3.So, the numbers in the 37th group are: 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, ..., up to 2107.So, 2008 is in the 37th group.Wait, let me confirm:Start of 37th group:1999Numbers:1999, 2002, 2005, 2008,...So, 2008 is the 4th number in the 37th group.But the question is just asking which group, not the position within the group. So, 2008 is in the 37th group.But let me double-check my calculations because I initially thought n=37, but the starting number was 1999, so 2008 is within that group.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering the entire sequence as an arithmetic progression and figuring out the term number, then mapping it to the group.The entire sequence is 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28,...This is an arithmetic progression with first term a=1 and common difference d=3.The nth term of this sequence is given by:a_n = a + (n-1)d = 1 + (n-1)*3 = 3n - 2So, to find which term 2008 is, set 3n - 2 =2008Solve for n:3n =2010n=670So, 2008 is the 670th term in the overall sequence.Now, each group has an increasing number of terms: group 1 has 1 term, group 2 has 2, group 3 has 3, etc.So, the total number of terms up to group k is the sum from 1 to k, which is k(k +1)/2.We need to find the smallest k such that k(k +1)/2 >=670.Solve for k:k(k +1)/2 >=670Multiply both sides by 2:k(k +1) >=1340Which is the same inequality as before.So, solving k^2 +k -1340 >=0Using quadratic formula:k = [ -1 + sqrt(1 + 4*1340) ] /2 = [ -1 + sqrt(5361) ] /2 ≈ [ -1 +73.22 ] /2 ≈36.11So, k=37Therefore, the 670th term is in the 37th group.So, both methods lead to the same conclusion: 2008 is in the 37th group.Wait, just to make sure, let me check the starting and ending terms of the 37th group.Start of 37th group: S(37)=1 + 3*(37*36)/2=1 + 3*666=1 +1998=1999End of 37th group: Last(37)=1999 + 3*(37 -1)=1999 + 3*36=1999 +108=2107So, the 37th group runs from 1999 to 2107, inclusive.2008 is within this range, so yes, it's in the 37th group.Alternatively, since 2008 is the 670th term, and the total number of terms up to group 36 is 36*37/2=666.So, term 666 is the last term of group 36, which is 1996.Then, term 667 is 1999, term 668 is 2002, term 669 is 2005, term 670 is 2008.So, 2008 is indeed the 670th term, which is in the 37th group.Therefore, the answer is 37.**Final Answer**boxed{37}"},{"question":"Find n such that 2^5 cdot 3^2 cdot n = 8!.","answer":"To find the value of ( n ) that satisfies the equation ( 2^5 cdot 3^2 cdot n = 8! ), I will follow these steps:First, I need to calculate the value of ( 8! ).

It's a bit new to me, but let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the definition says that for a rational number x, the associated number {x} is defined differently depending on whether x is non-negative or negative. If x is greater than or equal to zero, then {x} is 2x minus 1. If x is less than zero, then {x} is negative 2x plus 1. They even gave an example: {1} equals 2 times 1 minus 1, which is 1. That makes sense.Alright, moving on to part (1). It asks for {3/2} and {-1}. Let's tackle each one.Starting with {3/2}: since 3/2 is a positive number, I should use the first part of the definition. So, {3/2} should be 2 times 3/2 minus 1. Let me compute that:2 * (3/2) = 3. Then, 3 minus 1 is 2. So, {3/2} equals 2. That seems straightforward.Now, {-1}: since -1 is a negative number, I need to use the second part of the definition. So, {-1} is -2 times (-1) plus 1. Let me calculate that:-2 * (-1) = 2. Then, 2 plus 1 is 3. So, {-1} equals 3. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the associated number for a negative number is positive? That makes sense because if you plug in a negative x, you get a positive result.Okay, so part (1) is done. {3/2} is 2 and {-1} is 3.Now, part (2) is a bit more involved. It says: Given a > 0, b < 0, and {a} = {b}, find the value of the expression (a + b)^2 - 2a - 2b.Alright, let's parse this. We have two numbers, a and b. a is positive, so we'll use the first definition for {a}, and b is negative, so we'll use the second definition for {b}. They tell us that {a} equals {b}, so we can set up an equation.Let me write down what {a} and {b} are:Since a > 0, {a} = 2a - 1.Since b < 0, {b} = -2b + 1.Given that {a} = {b}, so:2a - 1 = -2b + 1.Okay, so now we have an equation relating a and b. Let's try to solve for one variable in terms of the other.So, 2a - 1 = -2b + 1.Let me bring all terms to one side:2a + 2b = 1 + 1That is, 2a + 2b = 2.Divide both sides by 2:a + b = 1.Oh, that's nice. So, a + b equals 1. That might be useful for the expression we need to compute.The expression is (a + b)^2 - 2a - 2b.Since we know that a + b is 1, let's substitute that in:(1)^2 - 2a - 2b.Which is 1 - 2a - 2b.Hmm, can we simplify this further? Let's factor out the -2:1 - 2(a + b).But wait, we already know that a + b is 1. So, substituting that in:1 - 2(1) = 1 - 2 = -1.So, the value of the expression is -1.Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.We have {a} = {b}, so 2a - 1 = -2b + 1.Adding 2b to both sides: 2a + 2b - 1 = 1.Then, adding 1: 2a + 2b = 2.Divide by 2: a + b = 1. That's correct.Then, the expression is (a + b)^2 - 2a - 2b.Which is 1^2 - 2(a + b).Which is 1 - 2*1 = -1.Yes, that seems right. So, the value is -1.Alternatively, I can think of it another way. Let's expand (a + b)^2:(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.So, the expression becomes a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - 2a - 2b.But since a + b = 1, maybe we can express this in terms of a + b.But I think my first approach was more straightforward. Since a + b is 1, substituting directly into the expression is simpler.Just to make sure, let me try plugging in some numbers for a and b that satisfy a + b = 1 and see if the expression gives -1.Suppose a = 2, then b = -1.Compute {a}: 2*2 -1 = 4 -1 = 3.Compute {b}: -2*(-1) +1 = 2 +1 = 3. So, {a} = {b} as required.Now, compute the expression: (2 + (-1))^2 - 2*2 - 2*(-1).That is (1)^2 - 4 + 2 = 1 - 4 + 2 = -1. Perfect, that matches.Another example: Let a = 1/2, so b = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Wait, but b has to be negative. So, maybe a = 3/2, then b = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2.Compute {a}: 2*(3/2) -1 = 3 -1 = 2.Compute {b}: -2*(-1/2) +1 = 1 +1 = 2. So, {a} = {b}.Now, compute the expression: (3/2 + (-1/2))^2 - 2*(3/2) - 2*(-1/2).Simplify inside the square: (1)^2 = 1.Then, -2*(3/2) = -3, and -2*(-1/2) = +1.So, total expression: 1 - 3 + 1 = -1. Again, it works.So, I feel confident that the value is indeed -1.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{2}; boxed{3}(2) boxed{-1}"},{"question":"Given that the function fleft(xright) is provided in the table below, then fleft(3right) is ______.| x | 1leqslant x lt 2 | 2 | 2 lt xleqslant 4 ||-----|----------------------|-----|----------------------|| fleft(xright) | 1 | 2 | 3 |","answer":"To determine the value of ( f(3) ), I first examine the intervals provided in the table.The table defines ( f(x) ) in three intervals:- For ( 1 leq x < 2 ), ( f(x) = 1 ).- At ( x = 2 ), ( f(x) = 2 ).- For ( 2 < x leq 4 ), ( f(x) = 3 ).Next, I identify which interval the value ( x = 3 ) falls into.

The expression given is ( x = frac{6t^3 - 9t + 1}{2t^3 - 3t} ). Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.First off, I remember that when dealing with limits at infinity, especially for rational functions like this one, the behavior is dominated by the highest degree terms in the numerator and the denominator. So, in this case, both the numerator and the denominator are cubic polynomials, meaning the highest power of ( t ) is 3 in both.Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:( x = frac{6t^3 - 9t + 1}{2t^3 - 3t} )So, both the numerator and the denominator have ( t^3 ) as their leading terms. I think the key here is to compare the coefficients of these leading terms because as ( t ) becomes very large, the lower degree terms become negligible in comparison.Let me try dividing both the numerator and the denominator by ( t^3 ) to see if that simplifies things. That way, each term will have a factor of ( t ) raised to some power, and as ( t ) approaches infinity, those terms with negative exponents will approach zero.So, dividing numerator and denominator by ( t^3 ):Numerator: ( frac{6t^3}{t^3} - frac{9t}{t^3} + frac{1}{t^3} = 6 - frac{9}{t^2} + frac{1}{t^3} )Denominator: ( frac{2t^3}{t^3} - frac{3t}{t^3} = 2 - frac{3}{t^2} )So now, the expression becomes:( x = frac{6 - frac{9}{t^2} + frac{1}{t^3}}{2 - frac{3}{t^2}} )Now, as ( t ) approaches infinity, the terms ( frac{9}{t^2} ), ( frac{1}{t^3} ), and ( frac{3}{t^2} ) all approach zero. So, substituting infinity into these terms, they become negligible.Therefore, the expression simplifies to:( x = frac{6 - 0 + 0}{2 - 0} = frac{6}{2} = 3 )So, as ( t ) becomes very large, the value of ( x ) approaches 3. That makes sense because the leading terms dominate the behavior of the function as ( t ) grows without bound.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I can try plugging in a very large value of ( t ) to see if ( x ) is close to 3.Let's say ( t = 1000 ). Plugging into the original expression:Numerator: ( 6*(1000)^3 - 9*(1000) + 1 = 6,000,000,000 - 9,000 + 1 = 5,999,991,001 )Denominator: ( 2*(1000)^3 - 3*(1000) = 2,000,000,000 - 3,000 = 1,999,997,000 )So, ( x = frac{5,999,991,001}{1,999,997,000} ). Let me compute this division.Dividing numerator and denominator by 1,000,000,000 to simplify:Numerator: ~6 - 0.0009 + 0.0000001 ≈ 5.9991Denominator: ~2 - 0.000003 ≈ 1.999997So, ( x ≈ frac{5.9991}{1.999997} ≈ 3.0000015 ). That's very close to 3, which supports our earlier conclusion.Alternatively, maybe I can factor out ( t^3 ) from both numerator and denominator to see if that approach also gives the same result.Factoring ( t^3 ) from numerator:( 6t^3 - 9t + 1 = t^3(6 - frac{9}{t^2} + frac{1}{t^3}) )Similarly, denominator:( 2t^3 - 3t = t^3(2 - frac{3}{t^2}) )So, ( x = frac{t^3(6 - frac{9}{t^2} + frac{1}{t^3})}{t^3(2 - frac{3}{t^2})} )The ( t^3 ) terms cancel out, leaving:( x = frac{6 - frac{9}{t^2} + frac{1}{t^3}}{2 - frac{3}{t^2}} )Which is exactly what I had before. So, as ( t ) approaches infinity, the fractions with ( t ) in the denominator go to zero, and we're left with ( 6/2 = 3 ).Another way I can think of is using L’Hospital’s Rule, but I remember that L’Hospital’s is typically used for indeterminate forms like ( frac{infty}{infty} ) or ( frac{0}{0} ). In this case, as ( t ) approaches infinity, both numerator and denominator approach infinity, so it is indeed an indeterminate form of type ( frac{infty}{infty} ). So, maybe I can apply L’Hospital’s Rule here.Let me recall, L’Hospital’s Rule states that if ( lim_{t to c} frac{f(t)}{g(t)} ) is an indeterminate form ( frac{0}{0} ) or ( frac{infty}{infty} ), then the limit is equal to ( lim_{t to c} frac{f'(t)}{g'(t)} ), provided that this latter limit exists.So, let's compute the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator.First, the derivative of the numerator ( f(t) = 6t^3 - 9t + 1 ):( f'(t) = 18t^2 - 9 )Derivative of the denominator ( g(t) = 2t^3 - 3t ):( g'(t) = 6t^2 - 3 )So, applying L’Hospital’s Rule once, the limit becomes:( lim_{t to infty} frac{18t^2 - 9}{6t^2 - 3} )Hmm, this is still an indeterminate form ( frac{infty}{infty} ) as ( t ) approaches infinity, so maybe I can apply L’Hospital’s Rule again.Compute the derivatives of the new numerator and denominator.Derivative of ( 18t^2 - 9 ):( 36t )Derivative of ( 6t^2 - 3 ):( 12t )So, applying L’Hospital’s Rule a second time, the limit becomes:( lim_{t to infty} frac{36t}{12t} )Simplify this:( lim_{t to infty} frac{36t}{12t} = lim_{t to infty} 3 = 3 )So, using L’Hospital’s Rule twice also gives us the limit as 3. That's consistent with our previous methods.Wait, but I remember that L’Hospital’s Rule can sometimes be applied multiple times, but each time, we have to check if the new limit is still an indeterminate form. In this case, after the first derivative, we still had ( frac{infty}{infty} ), so applying it again was valid. After the second derivative, we had a finite limit, so we were done.Alternatively, another method I can think of is polynomial long division. Maybe if I divide the numerator by the denominator, I can see the behavior as ( t ) approaches infinity.Let me try that.Divide ( 6t^3 - 9t + 1 ) by ( 2t^3 - 3t ).So, set it up as:_________( 2t^3 - 3t ) ) ( 6t^3 + 0t^2 - 9t + 1 )First, divide the leading term of the numerator ( 6t^3 ) by the leading term of the denominator ( 2t^3 ), which gives 3. So, the first term of the quotient is 3.Multiply the entire denominator by 3:( 3*(2t^3 - 3t) = 6t^3 - 9t )Subtract this from the numerator:( (6t^3 + 0t^2 - 9t + 1) - (6t^3 - 9t) = 0t^3 + 0t^2 + 0t + 1 )So, the remainder is 1, and the degree of the remainder (which is 0) is less than the degree of the denominator (which is 3). Therefore, the division gives:( 3 + frac{1}{2t^3 - 3t} )So, the expression ( x ) can be written as:( x = 3 + frac{1}{2t^3 - 3t} )Now, as ( t ) approaches infinity, the term ( frac{1}{2t^3 - 3t} ) approaches zero because the denominator grows without bound. Therefore, ( x ) approaches ( 3 + 0 = 3 ).That's another way to see it. So, using polynomial long division also leads us to the conclusion that the limit is 3.Wait, let me verify this division step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, when I divided ( 6t^3 ) by ( 2t^3 ), I correctly got 3. Then, multiplying the denominator by 3 gives ( 6t^3 - 9t ). Subtracting that from the numerator, which is ( 6t^3 + 0t^2 - 9t + 1 ), gives ( 0t^3 + 0t^2 + 0t + 1 ). So, the remainder is indeed 1, and since the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the denominator, we're done. So, the expression is correctly broken down into 3 plus a term that goes to zero as ( t ) approaches infinity.Another thought: maybe I can factor both numerator and denominator and see if something cancels out, but given that both are cubic polynomials, factoring might be complicated. Let me see.Looking at the numerator: ( 6t^3 - 9t + 1 ). Hmm, factoring this might not be straightforward because it's not easily factorable by simple methods. Similarly, the denominator is ( 2t^3 - 3t ), which can be factored as ( t(2t^2 - 3) ). So, denominator is ( t(2t^2 - 3) ). The numerator doesn't seem to factor nicely with these terms, so factoring might not help here.Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution. Let me set ( u = 1/t ), so as ( t to infty ), ( u to 0 ). Then, rewrite the expression in terms of ( u ).So, substituting ( t = 1/u ):Numerator: ( 6*(1/u)^3 - 9*(1/u) + 1 = 6/u^3 - 9/u + 1 )Denominator: ( 2*(1/u)^3 - 3*(1/u) = 2/u^3 - 3/u )So, the expression becomes:( x = frac{6/u^3 - 9/u + 1}{2/u^3 - 3/u} )To simplify, let's multiply numerator and denominator by ( u^3 ) to eliminate the denominators:Numerator: ( 6 - 9u^2 + u^3 )Denominator: ( 2 - 3u^2 )So, ( x = frac{6 - 9u^2 + u^3}{2 - 3u^2} )Now, as ( t to infty ), ( u to 0 ). So, substituting ( u = 0 ):( x = frac{6 - 0 + 0}{2 - 0} = 6/2 = 3 )So, this substitution method also confirms that the limit is 3.This is a neat method because it transforms the limit at infinity into a limit at zero, which is often easier to handle, especially if you're more comfortable with limits approaching finite values.Wait, let me make sure I did that substitution correctly. So, starting with ( t = 1/u ), so as ( t to infty ), ( u to 0 ). Then, replacing each ( t ) with ( 1/u ), so ( t^3 = 1/u^3 ), ( t = 1/u ), etc. Then, multiplying numerator and denominator by ( u^3 ) to clear the denominators. That seems correct.So, after substitution and simplification, we end up with ( x ) expressed in terms of ( u ), and as ( u ) approaches zero, the expression approaches 3. So, that's another valid method.Another approach I can think of is using the concept of dominant terms. Since both numerator and denominator are dominated by their ( t^3 ) terms as ( t ) becomes very large, the ratio of the coefficients of these terms will give the limit.So, in the numerator, the coefficient of ( t^3 ) is 6, and in the denominator, it's 2. So, the ratio is ( 6/2 = 3 ). Therefore, the limit is 3.This is a quicker way, but it's essentially the same reasoning as dividing numerator and denominator by ( t^3 ) or using polynomial long division. It's just recognizing that the highest degree terms dictate the behavior at infinity.Let me just recap all the methods I've considered:1. Dividing numerator and denominator by ( t^3 ) and taking the limit as ( t to infty ).2. Applying L’Hospital’s Rule twice.3. Polynomial long division, which breaks the expression into a polynomial plus a remainder term that vanishes at infinity.4. Substitution ( u = 1/t ) to convert the limit into one as ( u to 0 ).5. Recognizing the dominant terms and taking their ratio.All these methods lead to the same conclusion that the limit is 3. So, I feel confident that this is the correct answer.Just to make sure, maybe I can graph the function ( x(t) = frac{6t^3 - 9t + 1}{2t^3 - 3t} ) and see its behavior as ( t ) increases. Although I can't graph it right now, I can reason that as ( t ) becomes very large, the function should approach the horizontal asymptote at ( y = 3 ), which is consistent with all the methods above.Additionally, considering the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, the horizontal asymptote is at the ratio of the leading coefficients, which is ( 6/2 = 3 ). So, that's another way to remember it.Wait, just to double-check, let me compute the limit using another substitution. Maybe set ( t = sqrt{s} ), but that might complicate things more. Alternatively, use a different substitution, but I think the methods I've already used are sufficient.In summary, through multiple approaches—simplifying by dividing by ( t^3 ), applying L’Hospital’s Rule, polynomial division, substitution, and recognizing dominant terms—I consistently arrive at the limit being 3. Therefore, I can confidently say that as ( t ) approaches infinity, ( x ) approaches 3.**Final Answer**The limit of ( x ) as ( t rightarrow infty ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Compute: 55times1212-15times1212 .","answer":"First, I notice that both terms in the expression (55 times 1212 - 15 times 1212) have a common factor of 1212.I can factor out 1212 from both terms, which simplifies the expression to (1212 times (55 - 15)).Next, I calculate the difference inside the parentheses: (55 - 15 = 40).Now, the expression becomes (1212 times 40).Finally, I multiply 1212 by 40 to get the final result."},{"question":"To solve the difficulty of drinking water for the residents in the old district of Yichang, the Yichang Municipal Government plans to help build a rectangular, lidless water tank with a volume of 4800m^{3} and a depth of 3m. If the cost per square meter of the tank bottom is 150 yuan and the cost per square meter of the tank wall is 120 yuan, please help design the water tank to minimize the total construction cost. What is the lowest total construction cost?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where the Yichang Municipal Government wants to build a rectangular, lidless water tank. The tank needs to have a volume of 4800 cubic meters and a depth of 3 meters. They want to minimize the total construction cost, which depends on the cost of the tank's bottom and walls. The bottom costs 150 yuan per square meter, and the walls cost 120 yuan per square meter. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let's visualize the tank. It's a rectangular prism without a lid. So, it has a base (the bottom) and four walls. The depth is given as 3 meters, which I think refers to the height of the tank. So, the height is fixed at 3 meters. The volume is 4800 cubic meters, which is length × width × height. Since the height is 3 meters, the base area (length × width) must be 4800 / 3 = 1600 square meters. So, the base area is 1600 m².Now, the problem is to find the dimensions of the base (length and width) that will minimize the total construction cost. The cost depends on the area of the bottom and the area of the walls. Let me denote the length as 'l' and the width as 'w'. So, the base area is l × w = 1600 m².The cost for the bottom is straightforward: it's the area of the base times the cost per square meter. So, that would be 1600 m² × 150 yuan/m². But wait, actually, since l × w = 1600, the cost for the bottom is 150 × l × w. But since l × w is fixed at 1600, the cost for the bottom is fixed at 150 × 1600 = 240,000 yuan. Hmm, so the bottom's cost doesn't change regardless of the specific length and width, as long as the base area is 1600 m². That means the variability in cost comes only from the walls.So, now I need to calculate the cost of the walls. The tank has four walls: two with dimensions length × height and two with dimensions width × height. Since the height is 3 meters, the area of the two longer walls is 2 × (l × 3) and the area of the two shorter walls is 2 × (w × 3). So, the total area of the walls is 2 × (l × 3) + 2 × (w × 3) = 6l + 6w.Therefore, the cost for the walls is 120 yuan/m² × (6l + 6w) = 120 × 6(l + w) = 720(l + w) yuan.So, the total construction cost is the sum of the bottom cost and the walls cost. The bottom cost is fixed at 240,000 yuan, and the walls cost is 720(l + w) yuan. So, total cost C = 240,000 + 720(l + w).But we know that l × w = 1600. So, we can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for w: w = 1600 / l.Substituting this into the total cost equation: C = 240,000 + 720(l + 1600 / l).So, now we have C as a function of l: C(l) = 240,000 + 720(l + 1600 / l).To find the minimum cost, we need to find the value of l that minimizes C(l). This is an optimization problem, so we can use calculus. Specifically, we can take the derivative of C with respect to l, set it equal to zero, and solve for l.First, let's write the function again:C(l) = 240,000 + 720l + (720 × 1600)/l = 240,000 + 720l + 1,152,000 / l.Now, let's compute the derivative of C with respect to l:C'(l) = dC/dl = 720 - 1,152,000 / l².To find the critical points, set C'(l) = 0:720 - 1,152,000 / l² = 0.Let's solve for l:720 = 1,152,000 / l²Multiply both sides by l²:720 l² = 1,152,000Divide both sides by 720:l² = 1,152,000 / 720Calculate that:1,152,000 ÷ 720. Let's see, 720 × 1000 = 720,000, so 1,152,000 - 720,000 = 432,000. So, 720 × 1600 = 1,152,000. Wait, no, 720 × 1600 is 1,152,000. So, 1,152,000 ÷ 720 = 1600.So, l² = 1600Therefore, l = sqrt(1600) = 40 meters.So, the length that minimizes the cost is 40 meters. Then, the width w is 1600 / l = 1600 / 40 = 40 meters.Wait, so both length and width are 40 meters? That would make the base a square. Interesting.So, the minimal cost occurs when the base is a square with sides of 40 meters each. Let me verify that this is indeed a minimum.We can check the second derivative to confirm whether this critical point is a minimum.Compute the second derivative C''(l):C''(l) = d/dl [720 - 1,152,000 / l²] = 0 + (2 × 1,152,000) / l³ = 2,304,000 / l³.Since l is positive, C''(l) is positive, which means the function is concave upwards at this point, so it is indeed a minimum.Therefore, the minimal total construction cost is achieved when the base is a square of 40 meters by 40 meters.Now, let's compute the total cost.First, the cost of the bottom is fixed at 240,000 yuan.The cost of the walls: 720(l + w) = 720(40 + 40) = 720 × 80 = 57,600 yuan.Therefore, total cost C = 240,000 + 57,600 = 297,600 yuan.Wait, let me double-check the calculation for the walls.The area of the walls is 6l + 6w, which when l = w = 40, becomes 6×40 + 6×40 = 240 + 240 = 480 m². Then, the cost is 480 × 120 = 57,600 yuan. Yes, that's correct.So, adding the bottom cost: 240,000 + 57,600 = 297,600 yuan.Hmm, so the minimal total construction cost is 297,600 yuan.But wait a second, is there a way to confirm that this is indeed the minimal cost? Maybe by testing another set of dimensions.Suppose instead of 40x40, we take l = 50 meters, then w = 1600 / 50 = 32 meters.Compute the cost of the walls: 720(l + w) = 720(50 + 32) = 720 × 82 = let's compute that: 720 × 80 = 57,600; 720 × 2 = 1,440; total 57,600 + 1,440 = 59,040 yuan.So, total cost would be 240,000 + 59,040 = 299,040 yuan, which is higher than 297,600.Similarly, if we take l = 30 meters, then w = 1600 / 30 ≈ 53.333 meters.Compute walls cost: 720(30 + 53.333) ≈ 720 × 83.333 ≈ 720 × 83 + 720 × 0.333 ≈ 59,760 + 240 ≈ 60,000 yuan.Total cost ≈ 240,000 + 60,000 = 300,000 yuan, which is again higher.Alternatively, let's take l = 40 meters, w = 40 meters, which gives us 297,600 yuan, which is lower.So, this seems to confirm that 40x40 is indeed the minimal.Alternatively, let's try l = 48 meters, w = 1600 / 48 ≈ 33.333 meters.Compute walls cost: 720(48 + 33.333) ≈ 720 × 81.333 ≈ 720 × 80 + 720 × 1.333 ≈ 57,600 + 960 ≈ 58,560 yuan.Total cost ≈ 240,000 + 58,560 = 298,560 yuan, which is still higher than 297,600.So, it seems that 40x40 is indeed the minimal.Alternatively, let's try l = 32 meters, w = 1600 / 32 = 50 meters.Compute walls cost: 720(32 + 50) = 720 × 82 = same as before, 59,040 yuan. So, total cost 240,000 + 59,040 = 299,040 yuan.Same as before, higher.So, seems consistent.Therefore, I think the minimal cost is achieved when the base is a square with sides of 40 meters, resulting in a total cost of 297,600 yuan.But let me just verify my calculus again to be thorough.We had:C(l) = 240,000 + 720l + 1,152,000 / lFirst derivative:C'(l) = 720 - 1,152,000 / l²Set to zero:720 = 1,152,000 / l²Multiply both sides by l²:720 l² = 1,152,000Divide both sides by 720:l² = 1,152,000 / 720Calculate 1,152,000 ÷ 720:Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 115,200 / 72115,200 ÷ 72: 72 × 1,600 = 115,200. So, l² = 1,600, so l = 40. Correct.Second derivative:C''(l) = 2,304,000 / l³At l = 40, C''(40) = 2,304,000 / (40)^3 = 2,304,000 / 64,000 = 36. Which is positive, so it's a minimum.Therefore, all checks out.So, the minimal total construction cost is 297,600 yuan.**Final Answer**The lowest total construction cost is boxed{297600} yuan."},{"question":"A bag of dozen apples costs 14 and Brian has already spent 10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas.

Hmm, I remember that even functions satisfy the condition ( f(x) = f(-x) ) for all ( x ) in their domain. So, I need to apply this condition to the given function and solve for ( a ).First, let me write down the function again to make sure I have it correctly:( y = (x - 1)^2 + ax + sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) )Alright, so I need to find ( a ) such that this function is even. That means when I plug in ( -x ) into the function, it should equal the original function. Let me compute ( f(-x) ):( f(-x) = (-x - 1)^2 + a(-x) + sinleft(-x + frac{pi}{2}right) )Now, let me simplify each term step by step.First term: ( (-x - 1)^2 ). Let me expand this:( (-x - 1)^2 = (-x - 1)(-x - 1) = x^2 + 2x + 1 )Wait, hold on. Let me compute that again. Multiplying ( (-x - 1) ) by itself:First, ( (-x) times (-x) = x^2 )Then, ( (-x) times (-1) = x )Then, ( (-1) times (-x) = x )Finally, ( (-1) times (-1) = 1 )So, adding all these up: ( x^2 + x + x + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1 ). Okay, that seems correct.Second term: ( a(-x) = -ax )Third term: ( sinleft(-x + frac{pi}{2}right) ). Hmm, I can use the sine addition formula here. Remember that ( sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B ). So, let me rewrite ( sinleft(-x + frac{pi}{2}right) ) as ( sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - xright) ). That might be easier to handle.So, ( sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - xright) ). I remember that ( sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - xright) = cos x ). Yes, that's a co-function identity. So, that simplifies the third term to ( cos x ).Putting it all together, ( f(-x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos x ).Now, let me write down the original function ( f(x) ):( f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + ax + sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) )Again, let me expand ( (x - 1)^2 ):( (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 )And the sine term: ( sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) ). Using the sine addition formula again:( sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) = sin x cos frac{pi}{2} + cos x sin frac{pi}{2} )We know that ( cos frac{pi}{2} = 0 ) and ( sin frac{pi}{2} = 1 ), so this simplifies to:( sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) = 0 + cos x = cos x )So, the original function simplifies to:( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 + ax + cos x )Combining like terms:( f(x) = x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos x )Similarly, from earlier, we have:( f(-x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos x )So, now, since ( f(x) ) is even, ( f(x) = f(-x) ). Therefore, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:( x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos x = x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos x )Hmm, let's subtract ( x^2 + 1 + cos x ) from both sides to simplify:Left side: ( (a - 2)x )Right side: ( 2x - ax )So, we have:( (a - 2)x = (2 - a)x )Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me write it step by step.Subtracting ( x^2 + 1 + cos x ) from both sides:Left side: ( x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos x - x^2 - 1 - cos x = (a - 2)x )Right side: ( x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos x - x^2 - 1 - cos x = 2x - ax )So, indeed, we have:( (a - 2)x = (2 - a)x )Hmm, so ( (a - 2)x = (2 - a)x ). Let me bring all terms to one side:( (a - 2)x - (2 - a)x = 0 )Factor out ( x ):( [ (a - 2) - (2 - a) ]x = 0 )Simplify inside the brackets:( (a - 2 - 2 + a)x = 0 )Combine like terms:( (2a - 4)x = 0 )So, ( (2a - 4)x = 0 ) for all ( x ). Since this must hold for all ( x ), the coefficient must be zero. Therefore:( 2a - 4 = 0 )Solving for ( a ):( 2a = 4 )( a = 2 )Wait, let me check if this makes sense. If ( a = 2 ), then let's substitute back into the original function and see if it becomes even.Original function:( f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + 2x + sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) )Simplify:( (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 )So, ( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 2x + cos x )Simplify terms:( x^2 + 1 + cos x )So, ( f(x) = x^2 + 1 + cos x )Now, let's compute ( f(-x) ):( f(-x) = (-x)^2 + 1 + cos(-x) )Simplify:( x^2 + 1 + cos x ) (since ( cos(-x) = cos x ))So, ( f(-x) = x^2 + 1 + cos x = f(x) ). Perfect, it is indeed even. So, ( a = 2 ) is correct.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier, let me go back through my steps.Starting from ( f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + ax + sin(x + pi/2) )I expanded ( (x - 1)^2 ) correctly to ( x^2 - 2x + 1 ). Then, the sine term became ( cos x ) because ( sin(x + pi/2) = cos x ). So, ( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 + ax + cos x ), which simplifies to ( x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos x ).Similarly, ( f(-x) = (-x - 1)^2 + a(-x) + sin(-x + pi/2) ). I expanded ( (-x -1)^2 ) correctly to ( x^2 + 2x + 1 ). The sine term became ( sin(pi/2 - x) = cos x ). So, ( f(-x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos x ), which simplifies to ( x^2 + (2 - a)x + 1 + cos x ).Setting ( f(x) = f(-x) ), we have:( x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos x = x^2 + (2 - a)x + 1 + cos x )Subtracting ( x^2 + 1 + cos x ) from both sides gives:( (a - 2)x = (2 - a)x )Which simplifies to ( (2a - 4)x = 0 ), leading to ( a = 2 ). All steps seem correct, so I think I can confidently say that ( a = 2 ).Just to double-check, let me plug ( a = 2 ) back into ( f(x) ) and see if it's even.( f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + 2x + sin(x + pi/2) )Expanding ( (x - 1)^2 ):( x^2 - 2x + 1 )So, ( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 2x + cos x )Simplify:( x^2 + 1 + cos x )Which is clearly even because replacing ( x ) with ( -x ) gives the same expression.Therefore, the value of ( a ) is 2.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"If ( 3 times 2 + 8 = nabla + 5 ), then (nabla) equals(A) 14(B) 25(C) 19(D) 17(E) 9","answer":"First, I'll simplify the left side of the equation by performing the multiplication and addition.3 multiplied by 2 is 6, and adding 8 gives a total of 14.Now, the equation is 14 equals the unknown value ∇ plus 5.To find ∇, I'll subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.14 minus 5 equals 9.Therefore, the value of ∇ is 9."},{"question":"In a class of 50 students, it is decided to use systematic sampling to select 10 students out of these 50. The students are randomly assigned numbers from 1 to 50 and grouped, with the first group being numbers 1 to 5, the second group 6 to 10, and so on, up to the tenth group which is 46 to 50. If a student with the number 12 is selected from the third group, then the student with the number ___ will be selected from the eighth group.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about systematic sampling in a class of 50 students. They want to select 10 students using this method. The students are numbered from 1 to 50 and grouped into 10 groups, each containing 5 students. The first group is 1-5, the second is 6-10, and so on until the tenth group, which is 46-50.The problem states that a student with the number 12 is selected from the third group. Then, it asks which student will be selected from the eighth group. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to recall what systematic sampling is. From what I remember, systematic sampling is a method where you select members from a larger population at regular intervals. It's different from simple random sampling because instead of choosing completely randomly, you have a fixed interval, called the sampling interval.In this case, there are 50 students and they want to select 10. So, the sampling interval would be 50 divided by 10, which is 5. That makes sense because each group has 5 students. So, every 5th student is selected, but I think it starts with a random starting point within the first interval.Wait, so in systematic sampling, you usually pick a random starting point between 1 and the sampling interval, and then add the interval each time to get the next sample. So, if the interval is 5, you might start at, say, 3, and then select 3, 8, 13, 18, and so on.But in this problem, they've already grouped the students into 10 groups of 5. So, each group is like a block of 5 students. So, if they're using systematic sampling, they might be selecting one student from each group. That would make sense because they need 10 students from 50, so one from each group.But the problem says they selected student number 12 from the third group. So, let me see. The third group is 11-15, right? Because the first group is 1-5, second is 6-10, third is 11-15. So, 12 is in the third group.So, if 12 is selected from the third group, how does that affect the selection from the eighth group?Hmm, maybe the key here is to figure out the systematic pattern. Since they're selecting one from each group, and the third group's selected student is 12, we can figure out the pattern.Wait, let's think about how systematic sampling works here. If they're selecting one from each group, that would mean that the starting point is somewhere in the first group, and then they add 5 each time to get to the next group.But in this case, the third group's selected student is 12. So, maybe the starting point is 12 minus 2 intervals? Because the third group is two intervals after the first group.Wait, let me think. If each group is 5 students, then moving from one group to the next is adding 5. So, the first group is 1-5, second is 6-10, third is 11-15, and so on.If they selected 12 from the third group, that would mean that the starting point is 12 minus 2*5, which is 2. So, starting at 2, then adding 5 each time: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47.Wait, let me check that. If the starting point is 2, then the first selected student is 2 (from group 1), then 7 (group 2), 12 (group 3), 17 (group 4), 22 (group 5), 27 (group 6), 32 (group 7), 37 (group 8), 42 (group 9), and 47 (group 10). So, that seems to fit.So, if that's the case, then from the eighth group, which is 36-40, the selected student would be 37.Wait, hold on. The eighth group is 41-45? Wait, no. Let me recount the groups.Wait, first group: 1-5Second: 6-10Third: 11-15Fourth: 16-20Fifth: 21-25Sixth: 26-30Seventh: 31-35Eighth: 36-40Ninth: 41-45Tenth: 46-50Wait, so eighth group is 36-40. So, if the selected student from the eighth group is 37, that's correct.But wait, let me verify the starting point again. If the starting point is 2, then the first selected is 2, then 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47. So, yeah, 37 is in the eighth group, which is 36-40.But hold on, 37 is in 36-40, correct. So, that seems to be the answer.But let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached?Alternatively, since each group is 5 students, and they're selecting one from each group, the selection within each group is determined by the starting point.If the third group's selected student is 12, which is the second student in the third group (since 11 is the first, 12 is the second, 13 third, etc.), then perhaps the selection is the same position within each group.So, if in the third group, they picked the second student (12), then in the eighth group, they would pick the second student as well.Looking at the eighth group, which is 36-40, the second student would be 37.So, that also gives 37.Alternatively, if they picked 12 from the third group, which is 11-15, 12 is the second position. So, if we follow that, in each group, the second student is selected.Therefore, in the eighth group, the second student is 37.So, either way, whether thinking about the starting point or the position within the group, it seems that 37 is the answer.But let me just confirm once more.If the starting point is 2, then the selected students are 2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,42,47.Yes, that's 10 students, each 5 apart, starting at 2.So, in the eighth group, which is 36-40, the selected student is 37.Alternatively, if we think of the selection as picking the same position in each group, since 12 is the second in the third group, then in the eighth group, the second would be 37.Either approach leads to 37.Therefore, I think the answer is 37.**Final Answer**The student with the number boxed{37} will be selected from the eighth group."},{"question":"Write the smallest natural number composed of all possible distinct digits.","answer":"To determine the smallest natural number composed of all possible distinct digits, I need to consider the digits from 0 to 9, as these are the fundamental digits in the decimal system.First, I recognize that a natural number cannot start with 0, so the first digit must be the smallest non-zero digit available, which is 1.Next, to ensure the number is the smallest possible, the remaining digits should be arranged in ascending order.

It's given in parametric form, which is:[begin{cases}x = 5cosvarphi y = 3sinvarphiend{cases}]Alright, so part (I) asks me to find the general equation of a straight line ( l ) that passes through the right focus of the ellipse and is parallel to another line given by parametric equations:[begin{cases}x = 4 - 2t y = 3 - tend{cases}]First, I need to figure out the general equation of line ( l ). To do that, I think I need two things: a point that the line passes through and the direction vector or slope of the line.The line passes through the right focus of the ellipse. So, I need to find the coordinates of the right focus of ellipse ( C ). Since the ellipse is given in parametric form, I can recall that the standard parametric equations for an ellipse are:[x = acosvarphi y = bsinvarphi]where ( a ) is the semi-major axis and ( b ) is the semi-minor axis. Comparing this to the given equations, ( a = 5 ) and ( b = 3 ). So, the major axis is along the x-axis because ( a > b ).Now, to find the foci of the ellipse, I remember that the distance from the center to each focus is ( c ), where ( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 ). Let me compute that:( c^2 = 5^2 - 3^2 = 25 - 9 = 16 )So, ( c = 4 ). Since the major axis is along the x-axis, the foci are located at ( ( pm c, 0 ) ). Therefore, the right focus is at ( (4, 0) ).Okay, so the line ( l ) passes through the point ( (4, 0) ).Next, I need the direction of the line ( l ). It says that ( l ) is parallel to the line given by the parametric equations:[x = 4 - 2t y = 3 - t]So, to find the direction vector of this line, I can look at the coefficients of ( t ) in the parametric equations. The direction vector is ( (-2, -1) ). Therefore, the slope of this line is ( frac{-1}{-2} = frac{1}{2} ).Since line ( l ) is parallel to this line, it must have the same slope. So, the slope of line ( l ) is ( frac{1}{2} ).Now, with the slope and a point, I can write the equation of line ( l ). Using the point-slope form:( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) )Plugging in the point ( (4, 0) ) and slope ( frac{1}{2} ):( y - 0 = frac{1}{2}(x - 4) )Simplifying:( y = frac{1}{2}x - 2 )To write this in general form, I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:( 2y = x - 4 )Then, rearranging:( x - 2y - 4 = 0 )So, the general equation of line ( l ) is ( x - 2y - 4 = 0 ).Wait, let me double-check my steps. I found the foci correctly? Yes, ( c = 4 ), so right focus is at (4, 0). The direction vector from the parametric equations is (-2, -1), so slope is 1/2. Then, point-slope gives me y = (1/2)(x - 4), which simplifies to y = (1/2)x - 2. Converting to general form: x - 2y - 4 = 0. That seems correct.Alright, moving on to part (II): Find the maximum area of the inscribed rectangle ( ABCD ) in ellipse ( C ).Hmm, inscribed rectangle in an ellipse. I remember that for an ellipse, the maximum area of an inscribed rectangle occurs when the rectangle's sides are aligned with the major and minor axes. But wait, is that the case? Or is it when the rectangle is rotated?Wait, actually, I think the maximum area occurs when the rectangle is axis-aligned. Let me think about it.The ellipse equation can be written in standard form. Since the parametric equations are ( x = 5cosvarphi ) and ( y = 3sinvarphi ), the standard Cartesian equation is:( frac{x^2}{25} + frac{y^2}{9} = 1 )So, the ellipse is centered at the origin, with semi-major axis 5 along the x-axis and semi-minor axis 3 along the y-axis.An inscribed rectangle would have its vertices on the ellipse. If the rectangle is axis-aligned, then the coordinates of the vertices would be ( (a, b) ), ( (-a, b) ), ( (-a, -b) ), ( (a, -b) ) for some ( a ) and ( b ).The area of such a rectangle would be ( 2a times 2b = 4ab ). So, to maximize the area, we need to maximize ( ab ) subject to the ellipse equation ( frac{a^2}{25} + frac{b^2}{9} = 1 ).So, this is an optimization problem. We can use Lagrange multipliers or substitution. Let me try substitution.From the ellipse equation:( frac{a^2}{25} + frac{b^2}{9} = 1 )Let me solve for ( b^2 ):( frac{b^2}{9} = 1 - frac{a^2}{25} )So,( b^2 = 9left(1 - frac{a^2}{25}right) )Therefore,( b = 3sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{25}} )So, the area squared is ( (4ab)^2 = 16a^2b^2 ). Let me compute ( a^2b^2 ):( a^2b^2 = a^2 times 9left(1 - frac{a^2}{25}right) = 9a^2 - frac{9a^4}{25} )So, to maximize ( a^2b^2 ), which is ( 9a^2 - frac{9a^4}{25} ), we can take the derivative with respect to ( a^2 ) and set it to zero.Let me denote ( u = a^2 ). Then, the expression becomes:( 9u - frac{9u^2}{25} )Taking derivative with respect to ( u ):( 9 - frac{18u}{25} )Set derivative equal to zero:( 9 - frac{18u}{25} = 0 )Solving for ( u ):( frac{18u}{25} = 9 )Multiply both sides by 25:( 18u = 225 )Divide by 18:( u = frac{225}{18} = frac{25}{2} )So, ( a^2 = frac{25}{2} ), which means ( a = frac{5}{sqrt{2}} ).Then, plugging back into the expression for ( b ):( b = 3sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{25}} = 3sqrt{1 - frac{25/2}{25}} = 3sqrt{1 - frac{1}{2}} = 3sqrt{frac{1}{2}} = frac{3}{sqrt{2}} )Therefore, the maximum area is:( 4ab = 4 times frac{5}{sqrt{2}} times frac{3}{sqrt{2}} = 4 times frac{15}{2} = 4 times 7.5 = 30 )So, the maximum area is 30.Wait, but hold on. Is that the maximum area? Because sometimes, when dealing with rectangles inscribed in ellipses, the maximum area might not necessarily be the axis-aligned one. Maybe a rotated rectangle can have a larger area?Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think. For a circle, the maximum area rectangle is the square, which is axis-aligned. For an ellipse, which is a stretched circle, I think the maximum area rectangle is also axis-aligned. Because stretching doesn't change the orientation of the maximum area rectangle.Alternatively, I can parametrize the rectangle with points on the ellipse and use calculus to verify.Let me consider a general rectangle inscribed in the ellipse. Let the coordinates of the vertices be ( (x, y) ), ( (-x, y) ), ( (-x, -y) ), ( (x, -y) ). The area is ( 2x times 2y = 4xy ). We need to maximize ( 4xy ) subject to ( frac{x^2}{25} + frac{y^2}{9} = 1 ).Using Lagrange multipliers, let me set up the function:( f(x, y) = 4xy )Constraint:( g(x, y) = frac{x^2}{25} + frac{y^2}{9} - 1 = 0 )The Lagrangian is:( mathcal{L}(x, y, lambda) = 4xy - lambdaleft(frac{x^2}{25} + frac{y^2}{9} - 1right) )Taking partial derivatives:( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial x} = 4y - lambda cdot frac{2x}{25} = 0 )( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial y} = 4x - lambda cdot frac{2y}{9} = 0 )( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial lambda} = -left(frac{x^2}{25} + frac{y^2}{9} - 1right) = 0 )From the first equation:( 4y = frac{2lambda x}{25} ) => ( lambda = frac{4y times 25}{2x} = frac{50y}{x} )From the second equation:( 4x = frac{2lambda y}{9} ) => ( lambda = frac{4x times 9}{2y} = frac{18x}{y} )Setting the two expressions for ( lambda ) equal:( frac{50y}{x} = frac{18x}{y} )Cross-multiplying:( 50y^2 = 18x^2 )Simplify:( 25y^2 = 9x^2 ) => ( y^2 = frac{9}{25}x^2 ) => ( y = pm frac{3}{5}x )Since we're dealing with the first quadrant for the point ( (x, y) ), we can take ( y = frac{3}{5}x ).Now, plug this into the ellipse equation:( frac{x^2}{25} + frac{(frac{3}{5}x)^2}{9} = 1 )Simplify:( frac{x^2}{25} + frac{frac{9}{25}x^2}{9} = 1 )Simplify the second term:( frac{x^2}{25} + frac{x^2}{25} = 1 )So,( frac{2x^2}{25} = 1 ) => ( x^2 = frac{25}{2} ) => ( x = frac{5}{sqrt{2}} )Then, ( y = frac{3}{5} times frac{5}{sqrt{2}} = frac{3}{sqrt{2}} )Therefore, the maximum area is ( 4xy = 4 times frac{5}{sqrt{2}} times frac{3}{sqrt{2}} = 4 times frac{15}{2} = 30 ), which matches my earlier result.So, whether I use substitution or Lagrange multipliers, I get the same maximum area of 30. Therefore, the maximum area of the inscribed rectangle is 30.But just to be thorough, is there a possibility that a rotated rectangle could have a larger area? I think in the case of an ellipse, the maximum area rectangle is indeed the axis-aligned one because of the symmetry. If you rotate the rectangle, the product ( xy ) might decrease because the ellipse is stretched more along the x-axis. So, I think 30 is correct.Therefore, summarizing:(I) The general equation of line ( l ) is ( x - 2y - 4 = 0 ).(II) The maximum area of the inscribed rectangle is 30.**Final Answer**(I) The general equation of line ( l ) is boxed{x - 2y - 4 = 0}.(II) The maximum area of the inscribed rectangle ( ABCD ) is boxed{30}."},{"question":"If 5 students are lined up, and students A and B cannot be next to each other, how many possible arrangements are there?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of possible arrangements for 5 students without any restrictions.

To do this, I can treat A and B as a single unit. This reduces the problem to arranging 4 units (the AB unit and the other 3 students). The number of ways to arrange these 4 units is 4! = 24. However, within the AB unit, A and B can switch places, so there are 2 possible arrangements for this unit. Therefore, the total number of arrangements where A and B are next to each other is 4! × 2 = 48.Finally, to find the number of valid arrangements where A and B are not next to each other, I subtract the number of restricted arrangements from the total number of arrangements: 120 - 48 = 72."},{"question":"If the two real roots of the quadratic equation x^{2}+left(k-2right)x-1=0 with respect to x are opposite to each other, then the value of k is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation: (x^{2} + (k - 2)x - 1 = 0). The problem says that the two real roots are opposite to each other. Hmm, I need to find the value of (k). First, let me recall what it means for two roots to be opposite. If two numbers are opposites, that means one is the negative of the other. So, if one root is (r), the other root should be (-r). That makes sense. So, the roots are (r) and (-r).Now, for a quadratic equation of the form (ax^{2} + bx + c = 0), the sum of the roots is (-b/a) and the product of the roots is (c/a). This is from Vieta's formulas, right?In this equation, (a = 1), (b = (k - 2)), and (c = -1). So, applying Vieta's formulas:1. Sum of roots: (r + (-r) = 0 = -b/a = -(k - 2)/1 = -(k - 2)).2. Product of roots: (r times (-r) = -r^{2} = c/a = -1/1 = -1).Let me write these down:1. Sum: (0 = -(k - 2))2. Product: (-r^{2} = -1)Starting with the sum equation: (0 = -(k - 2)). Let me solve for (k).Multiply both sides by -1: (0 = k - 2). Then, add 2 to both sides: (k = 2).Wait, so is that it? If (k = 2), then the equation becomes (x^{2} + (2 - 2)x - 1 = x^{2} - 1 = 0). Let me check the roots of this equation.Solving (x^{2} - 1 = 0), we get (x = 1) and (x = -1). Yes, these are opposites. So that seems correct.But let me also check the product of the roots. From the product equation: (-r^{2} = -1). So, multiplying both sides by -1, we get (r^{2} = 1), which means (r = 1) or (r = -1). So, the roots are indeed 1 and -1, which are opposites.Therefore, (k = 2) satisfies both conditions: the sum of the roots is zero, and the product is -1, which fits the equation.Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.Given the quadratic equation: (x^{2} + (k - 2)x - 1 = 0). The roots are opposites, so (r) and (-r).Sum of roots: (r + (-r) = 0). According to Vieta, this is equal to (-(k - 2)). So, (0 = -(k - 2)) leads to (k = 2).Product of roots: (r times (-r) = -r^{2}). Vieta says this is equal to (-1). So, (-r^{2} = -1) implies (r^{2} = 1), so (r = pm1). Thus, the roots are 1 and -1, which are opposites. Perfect.I think that's solid. So, (k) must be 2.But just to be thorough, let me plug (k = 2) back into the original equation and see if it works.Original equation becomes: (x^{2} + (2 - 2)x - 1 = x^{2} + 0x - 1 = x^{2} - 1 = 0).Solutions: (x = pm1), which are opposites. So, yes, that's correct.Is there any other possible value for (k)? Let me think. Suppose I didn't use Vieta's formula, but instead tried to solve for the roots directly.Let me denote the roots as (r) and (-r). Then, the quadratic can be written as ((x - r)(x + r) = x^{2} - r^{2}).Comparing this with the original equation (x^{2} + (k - 2)x - 1 = 0), we can equate coefficients:1. Coefficient of (x): In ((x - r)(x + r)), the coefficient is 0. In the original equation, it's (k - 2). So, (0 = k - 2), which gives (k = 2).2. Constant term: In ((x - r)(x + r)), it's (-r^{2}). In the original equation, it's (-1). So, (-r^{2} = -1), which gives (r^{2} = 1), so (r = pm1).Therefore, regardless of the method, we get (k = 2).Wait, another thought: since the quadratic has real roots, the discriminant must be non-negative. Let me check that.Discriminant (D = b^{2} - 4ac). For our equation, (a = 1), (b = (k - 2)), (c = -1). So,(D = (k - 2)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = (k - 2)^2 + 4).Since ((k - 2)^2) is always non-negative, adding 4 makes it positive. So, discriminant is always positive, meaning the equation always has two distinct real roots, regardless of (k). So, even when (k = 2), discriminant is (0 + 4 = 4), which is positive. So, that's fine.Therefore, (k = 2) is the only solution.I think that's thorough enough. I can't think of any other angles to approach this problem from. Both Vieta's formulas and factoring lead to the same conclusion, and checking the discriminant shows that the roots are real for any (k), so (k = 2) is valid.**Final Answer**The value of (k) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Given a, b, c in mathbb{R}, and a + 2b + 3c = 6, find the minimum value of a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of ( a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 ) given that ( a + 2b + 3c = 6 ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that when dealing with optimization problems like this, especially with quadratic expressions and linear constraints, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be useful. But since I'm still getting comfortable with these concepts, maybe I can try another approach too, just to verify.Another idea is to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. I think that might work here because we have a linear combination equal to a constant and we need to minimize a quadratic form. Let me recall the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: for any vectors ( mathbf{u} ) and ( mathbf{v} ), the square of their dot product is less than or equal to the product of their magnitudes squared. In mathematical terms, ( ( mathbf{u} cdot mathbf{v} )^2 leq ( mathbf{u} cdot mathbf{u} )( mathbf{v} cdot mathbf{v} ) ).So, if I can express the given constraint and the expression to minimize in terms of vectors, maybe I can apply this inequality. Let me try that.Let me define two vectors. Let ( mathbf{u} = (a, 2b, 3c) ) and ( mathbf{v} = (1, 1, 1) ). Wait, is that right? Hmm, actually, the constraint is ( a + 2b + 3c = 6 ). So, maybe I should adjust the vectors accordingly.Let me think again. If I set ( mathbf{u} = (a, 2b, 3c) ) and ( mathbf{v} = (1, 1, 1) ), then their dot product is ( a*1 + 2b*1 + 3c*1 = a + 2b + 3c = 6 ). Okay, that's the constraint. Now, the expression I need to minimize is ( a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 ). Let me see, that can be written as ( (a)^2 + (2b)^2 + (3c)^2 ), which is exactly ( mathbf{u} cdot mathbf{u} ). So, ( mathbf{u} cdot mathbf{u} = a^2 + (2b)^2 + (3c)^2 = a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 ).So, according to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, ( ( mathbf{u} cdot mathbf{v} )^2 leq ( mathbf{u} cdot mathbf{u} )( mathbf{v} cdot mathbf{v} ) ). Plugging in the values, we have:( (6)^2 leq (a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2)(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) ).Calculating the right side, ( 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 ). So, the inequality becomes:( 36 leq (a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2) * 3 ).Dividing both sides by 3, we get:( 12 leq a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 ).So, the minimum value of ( a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 ) is 12. But wait, is this achievable? Because the inequality gives a lower bound, but we need to check if equality can be attained.Equality in Cauchy-Schwarz holds when ( mathbf{u} ) and ( mathbf{v} ) are linearly dependent, meaning one is a scalar multiple of the other. So, ( mathbf{u} = k mathbf{v} ) for some scalar ( k ).So, ( (a, 2b, 3c) = k(1, 1, 1) ). Therefore, ( a = k ), ( 2b = k ), and ( 3c = k ). From these, we can express ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) in terms of ( k ):- ( a = k )- ( b = k/2 )- ( c = k/3 )Now, plugging these into the constraint equation ( a + 2b + 3c = 6 ):( k + 2*(k/2) + 3*(k/3) = 6 )Simplify each term:- ( 2*(k/2) = k )- ( 3*(k/3) = k )So, the equation becomes:( k + k + k = 6 )Which simplifies to:( 3k = 6 )Therefore, ( k = 2 ).So, substituting back:- ( a = 2 )- ( b = 2/2 = 1 )- ( c = 2/3 )Let me verify these values in the original expression:( a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 = (2)^2 + 4*(1)^2 + 9*(2/3)^2 )Calculating each term:- ( (2)^2 = 4 )- ( 4*(1)^2 = 4 )- ( 9*(4/9) = 4 )Adding them up: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. Perfect, that matches the lower bound we found earlier.So, the minimum value is indeed 12, achieved when ( a = 2 ), ( b = 1 ), and ( c = 2/3 ).Alternatively, I could have used the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this. Let me try that approach as a verification.We need to minimize ( f(a, b, c) = a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 ) subject to the constraint ( g(a, b, c) = a + 2b + 3c - 6 = 0 ).The Lagrangian function is:( mathcal{L}(a, b, c, lambda) = a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 - lambda(a + 2b + 3c - 6) )Taking partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero:1. ( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial a} = 2a - lambda = 0 ) => ( 2a = lambda ) => ( a = lambda/2 )2. ( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial b} = 8b - 2lambda = 0 ) => ( 8b = 2lambda ) => ( b = lambda/4 )3. ( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial c} = 18c - 3lambda = 0 ) => ( 18c = 3lambda ) => ( c = lambda/6 )4. ( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial lambda} = -(a + 2b + 3c - 6) = 0 ) => ( a + 2b + 3c = 6 )Now, substituting ( a = lambda/2 ), ( b = lambda/4 ), and ( c = lambda/6 ) into the constraint equation:( (lambda/2) + 2*(lambda/4) + 3*(lambda/6) = 6 )Simplify each term:- ( 2*(lambda/4) = lambda/2 )- ( 3*(lambda/6) = lambda/2 )So, the equation becomes:( lambda/2 + lambda/2 + lambda/2 = 6 )Adding them up:( (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2)lambda = 6 ) => ( (3/2)lambda = 6 )Solving for ( lambda ):( lambda = 6 * (2/3) = 4 )So, ( lambda = 4 ). Therefore:- ( a = 4/2 = 2 )- ( b = 4/4 = 1 )- ( c = 4/6 = 2/3 )Which are the same values as before. Plugging these back into ( f(a, b, c) ):( 2^2 + 4*(1)^2 + 9*(2/3)^2 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 )So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me consider another perspective. Maybe using substitution.We have the constraint ( a + 2b + 3c = 6 ). Let me solve for one variable, say ( a ), in terms of ( b ) and ( c ):( a = 6 - 2b - 3c )Now, substitute this into the expression to minimize:( f(b, c) = (6 - 2b - 3c)^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 )Let me expand this:First, expand ( (6 - 2b - 3c)^2 ):( = 6^2 + (-2b)^2 + (-3c)^2 + 2*(6*(-2b) + 6*(-3c) + (-2b)*(-3c)) )( = 36 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 + 2*(-12b - 18c + 6bc) )( = 36 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 - 24b - 36c + 12bc )So, the entire expression becomes:( f(b, c) = 36 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 - 24b - 36c + 12bc + 4b^2 + 9c^2 )Wait, hold on. That seems a bit off. Let me correct that. The original expression after substitution is:( f(b, c) = (6 - 2b - 3c)^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 )Which is:( [36 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 - 24b - 36c + 12bc] + 4b^2 + 9c^2 )Now, combine like terms:- ( 36 )- ( 4b^2 + 4b^2 = 8b^2 )- ( 9c^2 + 9c^2 = 18c^2 )- ( -24b )- ( -36c )- ( 12bc )So, ( f(b, c) = 36 + 8b^2 + 18c^2 - 24b - 36c + 12bc )Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can complete the squares or find critical points by taking partial derivatives.Let me try taking partial derivatives with respect to ( b ) and ( c ) and set them to zero.First, partial derivative with respect to ( b ):( frac{partial f}{partial b} = 16b - 24 + 12c = 0 )Partial derivative with respect to ( c ):( frac{partial f}{partial c} = 36c - 36 + 12b = 0 )So, we have the system of equations:1. ( 16b + 12c = 24 )2. ( 12b + 36c = 36 )Let me simplify these equations.Equation 1: Divide by 4: ( 4b + 3c = 6 )Equation 2: Divide by 12: ( b + 3c = 3 )So, now we have:1. ( 4b + 3c = 6 )2. ( b + 3c = 3 )Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:( (4b + 3c) - (b + 3c) = 6 - 3 )Simplify:( 3b = 3 ) => ( b = 1 )Plugging ( b = 1 ) into equation 2:( 1 + 3c = 3 ) => ( 3c = 2 ) => ( c = 2/3 )Then, from the constraint ( a = 6 - 2b - 3c ):( a = 6 - 2*1 - 3*(2/3) = 6 - 2 - 2 = 2 )So, again, we get ( a = 2 ), ( b = 1 ), ( c = 2/3 ). Plugging back into the expression:( 2^2 + 4*(1)^2 + 9*(2/3)^2 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 )Same result. So, all three methods—Cauchy-Schwarz, Lagrange multipliers, and substitution—lead me to the conclusion that the minimum value is 12.Just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way, perhaps using vectors and projection. Since the expression ( a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 ) can be thought of as a weighted sum of squares, it's like a norm in a space with different scaling for each variable. The constraint is a hyperplane in this space, and the minimum distance from the origin to this hyperplane would give the minimum value.But that's essentially what Cauchy-Schwarz does, so I think I've covered that.Alternatively, thinking in terms of quadratic forms, the expression is positive definite, so the minimum is achieved at a unique point, which we've found.I can also visualize this: in the 3D space with coordinates ( a, b, c ), the constraint is a plane, and the function ( a^2 + 4b^2 + 9c^2 ) is a paraboloid. The minimum occurs where the plane is tangent to the paraboloid, which geometrically corresponds to the point we found.So, after considering multiple approaches and verifying each step, I'm confident that the minimum value is indeed 12.**Final Answer**The minimum value is boxed{12}."},{"question":"Can a 5 times 5 board be completely filled with 1 times 2 dominoes?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: Can a 5x5 board be completely filled with 1x2 dominoes? Hmm, dominoes are those rectangular tiles that cover two squares each, right? So, if I have a 5x5 board, that's 25 squares in total. Each domino covers 2 squares, so if I try to cover the entire board, I would need 25 / 2 = 12.5 dominoes. Wait, that's not possible because you can't have half a domino. So, does that mean it's impossible? But wait, maybe I'm missing something.Let me think again. The board has 25 squares, which is an odd number. Each domino covers 2 squares, which is an even number. So, if I multiply the number of dominoes by 2, I should get an even number. But 25 is odd, so it's impossible to cover all squares with dominoes because you can't have a fraction of a domino. That seems straightforward.But maybe there's another way to look at it. Sometimes, problems like this have more to do with the arrangement rather than just the number of squares. For example, maybe the coloring of the board matters. I remember something about checkerboard colorings and domino tiling.Let me visualize a 5x5 checkerboard. It alternates black and white squares. In a 5x5 grid, how many black and white squares are there? Since it's odd by odd, there will be one more square of one color than the other. Specifically, there will be 13 squares of one color and 12 of the other. Let me count: the first row has 3 black and 2 white, the second row has 2 black and 3 white, and this alternates. So, over five rows, the total number of black squares would be 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 13, and white squares would be 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12. So, 13 black and 12 white squares.Now, each domino covers exactly one black and one white square, right? Because it's 1x2, it has to cover two adjacent squares, which are always different colors on a checkerboard. So, if I have 13 black squares and 12 white squares, each domino would cover one of each. Therefore, to cover all squares, I would need 13 dominoes to cover the black squares and 12 dominoes to cover the white squares, but that's impossible because each domino covers both a black and a white square. So, the number of dominoes would have to be equal to the number of squares of each color, but since they're unequal, it's impossible.Wait, so both the total number of squares being odd and the imbalance in the checkerboard coloring make it impossible. So, that seems like two different ways to see why it's impossible. But let me make sure I'm not missing any other factors.Is there any way to arrange dominoes on a 5x5 board without overlapping or going off the board? Well, dominoes are 1x2, so they can be placed either horizontally or vertically. But regardless of their orientation, they always cover two squares. So, no matter how you place them, you can't cover an odd number of squares with dominoes because each domino adds 2 squares, which is even. So, 25 is odd, so it's impossible.Alternatively, maybe I can think about tiling the board in smaller sections. For example, can I tile a 5x5 board by breaking it down into smaller rectangles that can be tiled with dominoes? Let's see. A 5x5 board can be divided into a 5x4 section and a 5x1 section. The 5x4 section can be tiled with dominoes because it's even in both dimensions, but the 5x1 section is just 5 squares, which is odd, so it can't be tiled with dominoes. So, that doesn't help.Alternatively, maybe divide it into 2x2 squares. Each 2x2 square can be tiled with two dominoes. But 5 is an odd number, so dividing the board into 2x2 squares would leave some leftover squares. Specifically, 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1. So, you can have two 2x2 blocks in each row and column, but then you have a 1x1 strip left, which again is odd and can't be tiled with dominoes.Another thought: maybe using some kind of spiral or other pattern to cover the board. But regardless of the pattern, each domino still covers two squares, so the total number must be even. Since 25 is odd, it's impossible.Wait, maybe I can think about the corners. Each corner is a single square, and dominoes cover two squares. So, if I place a domino in a corner, it would have to extend into the adjacent square. But then, the next domino would have to cover another two squares, but the arrangement might not allow it to fit without overlapping or leaving gaps.Alternatively, maybe trying to tile the board step by step. Start from one corner, place a domino horizontally, then another vertically, but quickly you'll find that you can't cover all squares without getting stuck because of the odd dimensions.Wait, another idea: maybe using a checkerboard argument again. Since the number of black and white squares is unequal, and each domino must cover one of each, the total number of dominoes would have to equal the number of squares of the smaller color, which is 12. But 12 dominoes would cover 24 squares, leaving one square uncovered. But since the board has 25 squares, that's exactly what happens. So, you can't cover all squares.Alternatively, if you tried to cover the board with dominoes, you'd end up with one square left, which is impossible because dominoes cover two squares. So, that's another way to see it.Wait, but maybe there's a way to arrange dominoes such that they overlap or something? But no, dominoes can't overlap; they have to cover the board without overlapping or going off the board.So, putting it all together, it seems like there are multiple reasons why a 5x5 board can't be completely filled with 1x2 dominoes. The total number of squares is odd, which is incompatible with dominoes that cover even numbers of squares. Additionally, the checkerboard coloring shows an imbalance in the number of black and white squares, which dominoes can't reconcile because each domino must cover one of each color.Therefore, I think the answer is no, it's impossible to completely fill a 5x5 board with 1x2 dominoes.**Final Answer**boxed{No}"},{"question":"Brennan was researching his school project and had to download files from the internet to his computer to use for reference.

Hmm, I need to find the value of 3x - 2y. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that both squares and absolute values are always non-negative. That means each part of this equation, (2x - 3y + 5)² and |x + y - 2|, must each be greater than or equal to zero. Since their sum is zero, each of them must individually be zero. Otherwise, if one was positive, the other would have to be negative to make the sum zero, but that's not possible because they can't be negative. So, that gives me two separate equations to solve.Let me write them down:1. (2x - 3y + 5)² = 02. |x + y - 2| = 0Starting with the first equation: (2x - 3y + 5)² = 0. To solve this, I can take the square root of both sides, which gives me 2x - 3y + 5 = 0. That simplifies to 2x - 3y = -5. I'll label this as equation (1).Now, the second equation: |x + y - 2| = 0. The absolute value of something is zero only when the something inside is zero. So, x + y - 2 = 0, which simplifies to x + y = 2. I'll call this equation (2).Alright, so now I have a system of two equations:1. 2x - 3y = -52. x + y = 2I need to solve for x and y. Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.Looking at equation (2): x + y = 2. Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for x: x = 2 - y.Now, substitute x = 2 - y into equation (1):2*(2 - y) - 3y = -5Let me compute that:First, multiply out: 2*2 is 4, and 2*(-y) is -2y. So, 4 - 2y - 3y = -5.Combine like terms: -2y - 3y is -5y. So, 4 - 5y = -5.Now, subtract 4 from both sides: -5y = -5 - 4, which is -9.So, -5y = -9. Divide both sides by -5: y = (-9)/(-5) = 9/5. So, y = 9/5.Now, substitute y back into equation (2) to find x. Equation (2): x + y = 2.So, x + 9/5 = 2. Subtract 9/5 from both sides: x = 2 - 9/5.Convert 2 to fifths: 2 is 10/5, so 10/5 - 9/5 = 1/5. Therefore, x = 1/5.So, x is 1/5 and y is 9/5. Now, the question asks for the value of 3x - 2y. Let me compute that.First, compute 3x: 3*(1/5) = 3/5.Then, compute 2y: 2*(9/5) = 18/5.Now, subtract: 3x - 2y = 3/5 - 18/5 = (3 - 18)/5 = (-15)/5 = -3.So, the value of 3x - 2y is -3.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with the equations:1. 2x - 3y = -52. x + y = 2Solving equation (2) for x: x = 2 - y. Plugging into equation (1):2*(2 - y) - 3y = -54 - 2y - 3y = -54 - 5y = -5-5y = -9y = 9/5. Correct.Then x = 2 - 9/5 = 1/5. Correct.Then 3x - 2y: 3*(1/5) = 3/5, 2*(9/5)=18/5. 3/5 - 18/5 = -15/5 = -3. Yep, that seems right.Alternatively, maybe I can check by plugging x and y back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.Original equation: (2x - 3y + 5)² + |x + y - 2| = 0.Compute 2x - 3y + 5: 2*(1/5) - 3*(9/5) + 5.2/5 - 27/5 + 5. That's (2 - 27)/5 + 5 = (-25)/5 + 5 = -5 + 5 = 0. So, the first term is 0² = 0.Compute |x + y - 2|: |1/5 + 9/5 - 2| = |10/5 - 2| = |2 - 2| = |0| = 0. So, the second term is 0.Thus, 0 + 0 = 0, which satisfies the equation. So, x = 1/5 and y = 9/5 are correct.Therefore, 3x - 2y is indeed -3.

The question is asking for the possible values of this final number.Hmm, okay. Let me try to understand the process here. Each time she picks two numbers, x and y, and replaces them with x + y + xy.

When she replaces them with x + y + xy, is there a pattern or a simplification here?Wait, x + y + xy can be factored. Let me check:x + y + xy = x(1 + y) + y = (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1.Oh, interesting! So, the operation is equivalent to taking (x + 1)(y + 1) and then subtracting 1. That seems useful. So, each time she combines two numbers, she's effectively multiplying their (x + 1) terms and then subtracting 1 at the end.So, if I think about this, maybe the key is to look at the product of (x + 1) for all the numbers on the board.

So, 1 + 1/n is (n + 1)/n. Therefore, the product P is the product from n=1 to 2012 of (n + 1)/n.Wait, that's a telescoping product! Let me write it out:P = (2/1) * (3/2) * (4/3) * ... * (2013/2012).Each numerator cancels with the denominator of the next term. So, everything cancels except the first denominator and the last numerator. Therefore, P = 2013/1 = 2013.So, the product of (x + 1) for all x on the board is 2013. Now, each operation Aïcha does preserves this product, right? Because when she replaces x and y with (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1, the new term is (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1, and the product P would be multiplied by (x + 1)(y + 1) and then divided by (x + 1)(y + 1) because she removes x and y and adds the new term. Wait, no, actually, let me think again.Wait, initially, P is the product of all (x + 1). When she replaces x and y with z = x + y + xy, then the new product P' would be P / [(x + 1)(y + 1)] * (z + 1). But z + 1 = (x + y + xy) + 1 = x + y + xy + 1 = (x + 1)(y + 1). So, P' = P / [(x + 1)(y + 1)] * (x + 1)(y + 1) = P. So, the product P remains the same after each operation.Therefore, no matter how Aïcha combines the numbers, the product of (x + 1) for all x on the board remains 2013. So, when only one number is left, say N, then N + 1 must be equal to 2013. Therefore, N = 2013 - 1 = 2012.Wait, so is the final number always 2012? That seems too straightforward. Let me verify with a smaller example.Suppose we have just two numbers: 1/1 and 1/2. Let's compute the final number.First, combine 1 and 1/2:1 + 1/2 + 1*(1/2) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 2.Alternatively, let's compute using the product method:P = (1 + 1)(1 + 1/2) = 2 * 3/2 = 3. So, the final number should be 3 - 1 = 2. Yep, that matches.Another example: three numbers: 1, 1/2, 1/3.First, combine 1 and 1/2: result is 2.Now, combine 2 and 1/3:2 + 1/3 + 2*(1/3) = 2 + 1/3 + 2/3 = 3.Alternatively, compute P:(1 + 1)(1 + 1/2)(1 + 1/3) = 2 * 3/2 * 4/3 = 4. So, final number is 4 - 1 = 3. Correct.Another way: combine 1/2 and 1/3 first.1/2 + 1/3 + (1/2)(1/3) = (3/6 + 2/6) + (1/6) = 5/6 + 1/6 = 1.Then combine 1 and 1: 1 + 1 + 1*1 = 3. Same result.So, regardless of the order, the final number is 3. So, in this case, it's consistent.Therefore, it seems that regardless of the order in which Aïcha combines the numbers, the final number is always 2012.Wait, but the problem says \\"What are the possible values of the final number?\\" implying that there might be more than one. But in my small examples, it's always fixed. So, maybe the final number is uniquely determined, regardless of the operations.Is that the case? Let me think again.Each time, the product P remains invariant. So, regardless of the operations, the product P is fixed at 2013. So, when only one number N is left, N + 1 = 2013, so N = 2012.Therefore, the final number must be 2012, regardless of the operations. So, the only possible value is 2012.Hence, the answer is 2012.**Final Answer**boxed{2012}"},{"question":"Calculate the integral:int_{0}^{pi / 2} cos ^{2}(cos x) + sin ^{2}(sin x) , dx","answer":"Okay, so I have this integral to solve: the integral from 0 to π/2 of [cos²(cos x) + sin²(sin x)] dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down or find some symmetry or substitution that helps.First, let me write it out again to make sure I have it correctly:int_{0}^{pi / 2} cos ^{2}(cos x) + sin ^{2}(sin x) , dxSo, it's the sum of two functions: cos squared of cos x and sin squared of sin x. I wonder if I can split this into two separate integrals:int_{0}^{pi / 2} cos ^{2}(cos x) , dx + int_{0}^{pi / 2} sin ^{2}(sin x) , dxThat might make it easier to handle each part individually. Let me denote the first integral as I1 and the second as I2.So, I1 = ∫₀^{π/2} cos²(cos x) dxand I2 = ∫₀^{π/2} sin²(sin x) dxNow, I need to figure out how to compute each of these. Hmm, both integrals involve trigonometric functions inside another trigonometric function, which is a bit tricky. Maybe I can use substitution or some kind of symmetry.Let me think about substitution. For I1, if I let u = cos x, then du = -sin x dx. But that might complicate things because of the sin x term. Similarly, for I2, if I let v = sin x, then dv = cos x dx. Again, the presence of cos x might complicate things.Wait, maybe there's a symmetry or a substitution that can relate I1 and I2. Let me consider substituting x with π/2 - x in one of the integrals. That often helps in integrals from 0 to π/2.Let's try that for I1. Let me substitute x with π/2 - x in I1.So, when x = 0, u = π/2, and when x = π/2, u = 0. So, the limits of integration would switch, but I can switch them back by adding a negative sign.So, I1 becomes:∫_{π/2}^{0} cos²(cos(π/2 - u)) (-du) = ∫₀^{π/2} cos²(sin u) duBecause cos(π/2 - u) = sin u. So, I1 is equal to ∫₀^{π/2} cos²(sin u) du.Similarly, let me try the same substitution for I2. Substitute x with π/2 - x in I2.I2 becomes:∫_{π/2}^{0} sin²(sin(π/2 - u)) (-du) = ∫₀^{π/2} sin²(cos u) duBecause sin(π/2 - u) = cos u. So, I2 is equal to ∫₀^{π/2} sin²(cos u) du.So now, I1 is ∫₀^{π/2} cos²(sin u) du and I2 is ∫₀^{π/2} sin²(cos u) du.Wait a minute, so I1 and I2 have similar forms, but with cos and sin swapped in some way. Maybe I can add them together or find a relationship between them.Let me write both I1 and I2:I1 = ∫₀^{π/2} cos²(sin u) duI2 = ∫₀^{π/2} sin²(cos u) duSo, if I add I1 and I2 together, I get:I1 + I2 = ∫₀^{π/2} [cos²(sin u) + sin²(cos u)] duHmm, that's interesting. So, the original integral is equal to I1 + I2, which is the same as ∫₀^{π/2} [cos²(sin u) + sin²(cos u)] du.But wait, that's the same as the original integral. So, that substitution didn't really help me compute it, but it showed that the integral is equal to itself under substitution, which suggests some symmetry.Maybe I can consider another substitution or perhaps use some trigonometric identities to simplify the integrand.Let me recall that cos²(a) + sin²(b) doesn't have a straightforward identity, but maybe I can express cos² and sin² in terms of double angles.Yes, the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2 and sin²θ = (1 - cos 2θ)/2.Let me apply that to both terms in the integrand.So, cos²(cos x) = [1 + cos(2 cos x)] / 2and sin²(sin x) = [1 - cos(2 sin x)] / 2So, the integrand becomes:[1 + cos(2 cos x)] / 2 + [1 - cos(2 sin x)] / 2Simplify this:= [1/2 + (cos(2 cos x))/2] + [1/2 - (cos(2 sin x))/2]= 1/2 + 1/2 + (cos(2 cos x) - cos(2 sin x))/2= 1 + [cos(2 cos x) - cos(2 sin x)] / 2So, the integral becomes:∫₀^{π/2} [1 + (cos(2 cos x) - cos(2 sin x))/2] dxWhich is equal to:∫₀^{π/2} 1 dx + (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} [cos(2 cos x) - cos(2 sin x)] dxCompute the first integral:∫₀^{π/2} 1 dx = π/2So, now the integral is:π/2 + (1/2)[ ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2 cos x) dx - ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2 sin x) dx ]Let me denote the two integrals as I3 and I4:I3 = ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2 cos x) dxI4 = ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2 sin x) dxSo, the integral becomes:π/2 + (1/2)(I3 - I4)Now, I need to compute I3 and I4.Hmm, these integrals look like they might be related to Bessel functions or some special functions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution or some symmetry.Let me consider substitution for I3. Let me set t = x - π/4 or something, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe use substitution u = π/2 - x for I4.Wait, let me try substitution for I4. Let me set u = π/2 - x in I4.So, when x = 0, u = π/2; when x = π/2, u = 0. So, I4 becomes:∫_{π/2}^{0} cos(2 sin(π/2 - u)) (-du) = ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2 cos u) duBecause sin(π/2 - u) = cos u. So, I4 = ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2 cos u) du = I3So, I4 = I3. Therefore, I3 - I4 = 0.Wow, that's helpful. So, the integral simplifies to:π/2 + (1/2)(0) = π/2So, the value of the original integral is π/2.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.1. I split the integral into I1 and I2.2. Substituted x with π/2 - x in both I1 and I2, leading to expressions in terms of u.3. Then, I expressed the original integral as I1 + I2, which became ∫₀^{π/2} [cos²(sin u) + sin²(cos u)] du.4. Then, I used the double-angle identities to rewrite the integrand, leading to 1 + [cos(2 cos x) - cos(2 sin x)] / 2.5. Split the integral into two parts: π/2 and (1/2)(I3 - I4).6. Then, by substitution, I found that I4 = I3, so their difference is zero.7. Therefore, the integral is π/2.Hmm, that seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to see this.Alternatively, maybe the original integrand has some symmetry that makes the integral equal to π/2.Wait, another approach: consider that for x in [0, π/2], cos x and sin x are related by sin x = cos(π/2 - x). So, maybe there's some kind of complementary relationship.But regardless, the substitution method seems solid, and the result is π/2.So, I think the integral evaluates to π/2.**Final Answer**The value of the integral is boxed{dfrac{pi}{2}}."},{"question":"Vasya wrote all natural numbers from 104 to 203 in the cells of a 10 times 10 table. He calculated the product of numbers in each row of the table and obtained a set of ten numbers. Then he calculated the product of numbers in each column of the table and also obtained a set of ten numbers. Could the resulting sets be identical?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where Vasya wrote all natural numbers from 104 to 203 in a 10x10 table. Then he calculated the product of numbers in each row and each column, resulting in two sets of ten numbers each. The question is whether these two sets could be identical. Hmm, interesting.First, let me try to understand the problem. We have a 10x10 grid, so 100 cells in total. Vasya filled each cell with a natural number starting from 104 up to 203. That makes sense because 203 - 104 + 1 = 100 numbers. So each number from 104 to 203 is used exactly once in the grid.Then, he calculated the product of each row, resulting in ten products, one for each row. Similarly, he calculated the product of each column, also resulting in ten products. The question is asking if these two sets of products could be identical. So, could the multiset of row products be exactly the same as the multiset of column products?I need to figure out if such an arrangement of numbers is possible where the products of the rows and columns are the same when considered as sets. That is, ignoring the order, the products are the same.Let me think about the properties of such a grid. Since each number is used exactly once, the grid is a Latin square in terms of numbers, but not necessarily in terms of products. The key here is that the products of rows and columns must form the same multiset.First, let's consider the total product of all numbers in the grid. The product of all numbers from 104 to 203 is equal to both the product of all row products and the product of all column products. So, the product of the row products is equal to the product of the column products, which is the same as the total product of all numbers in the grid.Therefore, the product of all the row products is equal to the product of all the column products. So, if the multisets of row products and column products are identical, their products must be equal, which they are. So, that condition is satisfied.But that doesn't necessarily mean that the multisets themselves are identical. It just means that their products are equal. So, we need more reasoning.Let me think about prime factors. Each number from 104 to 203 has its own prime factorization. The product of each row and each column will be the product of ten numbers, each contributing their own prime factors.If the multisets of row products and column products are identical, then each prime factor must appear the same number of times in the row products as in the column products.But wait, each prime factor comes from the numbers in the grid. Each prime factor is present in the grid a certain number of times, and when you compute the row products, each prime factor is distributed among the ten row products. Similarly, for column products.But since the grid is 10x10, each prime factor is present in some cells, and each cell is part of one row and one column. So, the total number of times a prime factor appears in the grid is equal to the sum of its exponents in the row products, which is also equal to the sum of its exponents in the column products.Therefore, for each prime, the total exponent in all row products is equal to the total exponent in all column products. So, the multisets of row products and column products must have the same multiset of exponents for each prime.But does that mean that the multisets of row products and column products can be rearranged to be the same?Wait, not necessarily. Because the distribution of exponents across the rows and columns could differ. For example, suppose a prime number p appears in two cells, both in the same row. Then, in the row products, p would contribute twice to that row's product, but in the column products, it would contribute once to each of two different columns.So, the exponents of p in the row products would have one row with exponent 2 and the rest with exponent 0, while in the column products, two columns would have exponent 1 and the rest 0. So, the multisets of exponents for p would be different between rows and columns.Therefore, unless the exponents of each prime are distributed in such a way that their exponents across rows and columns can form the same multiset, the multisets of row and column products can't be identical.So, for the multisets of row and column products to be identical, for each prime p, the exponents of p in the row products must form a multiset that is the same as the exponents of p in the column products.But as I saw in the example, if a prime appears in two cells in the same row, then in the row products, it's exponent 2 in one row, and in the column products, exponent 1 in two columns. These are different multisets.Therefore, unless each prime appears in exactly one cell per row and per column, which would be the case if each prime appears exactly once in each row and column, but that's not possible because primes can appear multiple times in the grid.Wait, but primes can only appear in numbers where they are factors. So, for example, prime 2 appears in many numbers from 104 to 203. Similarly, prime 3, 5, etc.So, primes like 2, 3, 5, etc., appear multiple times in the grid, each time contributing to the exponent in their respective row and column.Therefore, for each prime p, the exponents in the row products must form a multiset that is the same as the exponents in the column products.But in the example above, if a prime appears twice in the same row, then the row products would have a 2 in one row and 0 in others, while the column products would have 1s in two columns. So, the multisets are different.Therefore, to have the same multiset of exponents for each prime, each prime must appear the same number of times in each row and each column. But that's not possible unless each prime appears exactly once in each row and each column, which is not the case here.Wait, but primes can appear multiple times. So, perhaps the exponents per row and per column can be arranged such that the multisets are the same.Wait, let me think more carefully.Suppose that for each prime p, the exponents in the row products form a multiset R_p, and the exponents in the column products form a multiset C_p. For the row and column product multisets to be identical, for each prime p, R_p must be equal to C_p.But R_p is the multiset of exponents of p in each row, and C_p is the multiset of exponents of p in each column.But each exponent in R_p is the sum of exponents of p in the numbers of that row, and each exponent in C_p is the sum of exponents of p in the numbers of that column.Now, the total exponents of p in all rows is equal to the total exponents of p in all columns, which is the total exponents of p in the grid.But for R_p and C_p to be the same multiset, the distribution of exponents across rows must be the same as across columns.Is this possible?Well, for each prime p, the exponents in the rows must be a permutation of the exponents in the columns.But is that possible?Wait, for example, suppose that for each prime p, the exponents in the rows are the same as the exponents in the columns, just possibly in a different order.Is that possible?Yes, if the exponents of p in each row can be rearranged to match the exponents in each column.But how?Wait, in order for the exponents of p in rows and columns to be the same multiset, the exponents must be distributed in such a way that the multiset of exponents per row is equal to the multiset of exponents per column.But in the grid, each cell is in one row and one column, so the exponents of p in the grid are spread across both rows and columns.But unless the exponents are arranged in a symmetric way, the row and column exponent multisets might differ.Wait, perhaps if the grid is symmetric with respect to rows and columns, meaning that the exponent distribution is the same when viewed from rows or columns.But in this case, the grid is filled with numbers from 104 to 203, which are arbitrary. There's no inherent symmetry unless Vasya arranged them in a symmetric way.But the problem doesn't specify that Vasya arranged them in any particular way. It just says he wrote all natural numbers from 104 to 203 in the cells. So, it's possible that he arranged them in any order.Therefore, the question is whether there exists an arrangement where for each prime p, the exponents in the rows form the same multiset as the exponents in the columns.Is that possible?Wait, let's think about the exponents of a prime p.Suppose that in the grid, the exponents of p are arranged such that each row has the same number of exponents as each column. But that's not necessarily the case.Wait, no. For example, suppose p divides k numbers in the grid. Then, the exponents of p in the rows would be the sum of exponents in each row, and similarly for columns.But unless the exponents are arranged such that each row has the same number of exponents as each column, which is not necessarily the case.Wait, but the total exponents of p in rows is equal to the total exponents in columns, which is k times the exponent of p in each number.Wait, no, actually, each number contributes its exponent of p to one row and one column.Therefore, the total exponents of p in all row products is equal to the total exponents of p in all column products, which is equal to the total exponents of p in the grid.So, the sum of exponents in R_p is equal to the sum of exponents in C_p.But for R_p and C_p to be the same multiset, the individual exponents in rows and columns must be the same, just possibly permuted.But is that possible?Wait, for example, suppose that in the grid, the exponents of p are arranged such that each row has the same exponents as each column, but in a different order.But how?Wait, perhaps if the grid is symmetric, such that the exponent of p in row i, column j is equal to the exponent of p in column i, row j. Then, the exponents in rows and columns would be the same.But in this case, the grid is filled with numbers from 104 to 203, which are not necessarily symmetric.Alternatively, perhaps if the grid is arranged such that for each prime p, the exponents are distributed in a way that the row exponents and column exponents are permutations of each other.But is that possible?Wait, let's think about the exponents of 2.How many times does 2 appear as a factor in numbers from 104 to 203?Well, let's compute that.First, numbers from 104 to 203.Total numbers: 100.Number of even numbers: from 104 to 203, inclusive. 104 is even, 203 is odd. So, the number of even numbers is (202 - 104)/2 + 1 = (98)/2 + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50.So, 50 even numbers, each contributing at least one factor of 2.But some numbers contribute more than one factor of 2.For example, multiples of 4 contribute at least two factors, multiples of 8 contribute three, etc.So, let's compute the total exponent of 2 in the grid.Total exponent of 2 is the sum over all numbers from 104 to 203 of the exponent of 2 in each number.Similarly, for other primes.But this might be complicated.Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the exponents modulo something.Wait, but maybe it's better to think about the exponents of 2 in rows and columns.Suppose that for each row, the exponent of 2 is some number, and for each column, the exponent of 2 is some number.If the multisets of exponents are the same, then the sum of exponents in rows is equal to the sum in columns, which is true, but also, the individual exponents must be the same when considered as multisets.But in reality, the exponents in rows and columns are determined by how the numbers are arranged.If Vasya arranges the numbers such that the exponents of 2 in each row are the same as in each column, just permuted, then it's possible.But is that possible?Wait, for example, suppose that in each row, the exponents of 2 are arranged such that each row has the same multiset of exponents as each column.But how?Wait, perhaps if the grid is symmetric with respect to rows and columns, meaning that the exponent of 2 in cell (i,j) is equal to the exponent of 2 in cell (j,i). Then, the exponents in rows and columns would be the same.But in that case, the grid would need to be symmetric, which is possible if Vasya arranges the numbers in a symmetric way.But the problem doesn't specify that Vasya arranged the numbers in any particular way, just that he wrote all numbers from 104 to 203 in the cells.Therefore, the question is whether such an arrangement exists where the exponents of each prime in the rows and columns form the same multiset.But is that possible?Wait, perhaps not, because for some primes, the exponents are distributed in such a way that it's impossible to have the same multiset in rows and columns.For example, consider a prime that divides only one number in the grid. Then, that prime would contribute an exponent of 1 to one row and one column. So, in the row products, that prime would contribute 1 to one row, and 0 to others. Similarly, in the column products, it would contribute 1 to one column, and 0 to others. So, the multisets for that prime would be the same: one 1 and nine 0s.So, that's fine.But consider a prime that divides two numbers. If those two numbers are in the same row, then in the row products, that prime contributes 2 to one row, and 0 to others. In the column products, it contributes 1 to two different columns. So, the multisets for that prime would be different: {2,0,0,...,0} vs {1,1,0,...,0}. Therefore, the multisets are different.Therefore, unless the two numbers are arranged such that they are in different rows and different columns, so that each contributes 1 to different rows and different columns, then the multisets would be {1,1,0,...,0} for both rows and columns.Wait, but if the two numbers are in different rows and different columns, then each contributes 1 to their respective rows and columns, so the exponents in rows would be {1,1,0,...,0} and the exponents in columns would also be {1,1,0,...,0}, so the multisets would be the same.Therefore, for primes that divide two numbers, if those two numbers are placed in different rows and different columns, then the exponents in rows and columns would be the same.Similarly, for primes that divide three numbers, if those three numbers are placed such that each is in a different row and a different column, then the exponents in rows and columns would each have three 1s and seven 0s, so the multisets would be the same.Wait, but if a prime divides three numbers, and two of them are in the same row, then the exponents in rows would be {2,1,0,...,0}, while the exponents in columns would be {1,1,1,0,...,0}, assuming the third number is in a different column. So, the multisets would be different.Therefore, to have the same multiset, each prime that divides k numbers must have those k numbers arranged such that each is in a distinct row and a distinct column. That is, the numbers must form a permutation matrix for each prime.But that's only possible if for each prime p, the number of multiples of p in the grid is less than or equal to 10, which is true since the grid is 10x10.But more importantly, for each prime p, the exponents contributed by p must be arranged such that each multiple of p is in a unique row and a unique column.But is that possible for all primes simultaneously?Wait, that would require that for each prime p, the multiples of p form a permutation matrix in the grid.But in reality, the multiples of different primes overlap. For example, a number can be a multiple of both 2 and 3, so it would contribute to both primes.Therefore, arranging the grid such that for each prime, the multiples are in distinct rows and columns might not be possible because of overlapping multiples.For example, suppose a number is a multiple of both 2 and 3. If we try to arrange the multiples of 2 and 3 such that each is in a unique row and column, but the overlapping number would have to be in a unique row and column for both primes, which might conflict with other multiples.Therefore, it's impossible to arrange all primes in such a way that their multiples are in distinct rows and columns because of overlapping multiples.Hence, for some primes, their multiples will necessarily share rows or columns, leading to different exponent distributions in rows and columns, making the multisets different.Therefore, the multisets of row products and column products cannot be identical.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe for some primes, their multiples can be arranged without overlapping rows or columns, but for others, it's impossible.But since the problem is asking whether it's possible that the multisets are identical, we need to find if there exists any arrangement where this is possible.But given that for primes with multiple multiples, their exponents can't be arranged without overlapping, leading to different exponent distributions in rows and columns, it's impossible for all primes to have the same exponent multisets in rows and columns.Therefore, the answer is no, the resulting sets cannot be identical.Wait, but let me think about another angle. Maybe the products themselves, regardless of prime exponents, could form the same multiset.But the products are determined by the numbers in the rows and columns, which are unique. So, if the products are the same, then the sets of numbers in rows and columns must be permutations of each other.But each row is a set of ten unique numbers, and each column is also a set of ten unique numbers. So, if the products of the rows and columns are the same, then each row must be a permutation of a column.But in a 10x10 grid, each row is a permutation of a column only if the grid is symmetric in some way, such as being a Latin square or something similar.But even then, the products would only be the same if the numbers are arranged symmetrically.But in this case, the numbers are from 104 to 203, which are consecutive numbers, so arranging them symmetrically would require that the grid is symmetric, meaning that cell (i,j) equals cell (j,i). But that would mean that the grid is symmetric across its main diagonal.But in such a case, the row products would be equal to the column products, because each row is the same as the corresponding column.But wait, in that case, the multisets of row products and column products would indeed be identical, because each row product is equal to the corresponding column product.Wait, so if the grid is symmetric, then the row products and column products would be the same, hence the multisets would be identical.But is that possible?Yes, if Vasya arranged the numbers in a symmetric way, such that cell (i,j) equals cell (j,i) for all i,j. Then, each row would be the same as the corresponding column, so their products would be equal.But the problem is that the numbers from 104 to 203 are all distinct, so arranging them symmetrically would require that each number is placed in positions (i,j) and (j,i). But since the grid is 10x10, which is even in both dimensions, except for the diagonal, each pair (i,j) and (j,i) are distinct unless i=j.But the diagonal cells (i,i) would only contain one number each.But since all numbers are distinct, we can arrange them symmetrically by pairing each number with its transpose.Wait, but 10x10 grid has 100 cells. If we pair (i,j) and (j,i), for i ≠ j, we have 45 pairs, each containing two distinct cells, and 10 diagonal cells.But we have 100 distinct numbers, so we can assign each pair of cells (i,j) and (j,i) to have the same number? Wait, no, because all numbers must be distinct.Wait, that's a problem. Because if we want the grid to be symmetric, meaning cell (i,j) = cell (j,i), but all numbers must be distinct, then we cannot have cell (i,j) equal to cell (j,i) unless i=j.Therefore, the only way to have a symmetric grid with all distinct numbers is to have cell (i,j) ≠ cell (j,i) for i ≠ j, but arranged such that the grid is symmetric in some other way.Wait, but that's not possible because if cell (i,j) ≠ cell (j,i), then the grid isn't symmetric.Therefore, it's impossible to have a symmetric grid with all distinct numbers unless it's a diagonal grid, which isn't the case here.Therefore, arranging the grid symmetrically with all distinct numbers is impossible, because that would require that cell (i,j) = cell (j,i), which would mean that numbers are repeated, but all numbers must be distinct.Therefore, the grid cannot be symmetric, so the row products and column products cannot be the same.Therefore, the multisets of row products and column products cannot be identical.Wait, but hold on. Maybe the grid doesn't have to be symmetric in the sense that cell (i,j) = cell (j,i), but rather that the multiset of row products is the same as the multiset of column products, regardless of the order.So, even if the grid isn't symmetric, perhaps the products can still form the same multiset.But earlier, I thought that due to the prime exponents, it's impossible because of overlapping multiples.But maybe there's a way around it.Wait, let's think about the total number of times each prime appears in the grid.For example, take prime 2. It appears in 50 numbers, as we calculated earlier.Each of these 50 numbers contributes at least one factor of 2, some contribute more.So, the total exponent of 2 in the grid is more than 50.Similarly, for other primes.But for the row products and column products to have the same multiset, the exponents of each prime in the rows and columns must be the same.But as we saw earlier, if a prime divides two numbers in the same row, then in the row products, that prime contributes 2 to one row, while in the column products, it contributes 1 to two different columns.Therefore, the multisets of exponents for that prime would differ between rows and columns.Hence, the multisets of row products and column products would differ.Therefore, it's impossible for the multisets to be identical.Therefore, the answer is no, the resulting sets cannot be identical.**Final Answer**boxed{No}"},{"question":"Let O and H be the circumcenter and orthocenter of triangle ABC, respectively.  Let a, b, and c denote the side lengths, and let R denote the circumradius.  Find OH^2 if R = 7 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find ( OH^2 ) given that the circumradius ( R = 7 ) and the sum of the squares of the side lengths ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ). Hmm, let me recall what I know about the relationship between the circumcenter ( O ) and the orthocenter ( H ) in a triangle.I remember there's a formula that relates ( OH^2 ) with other elements of the triangle. I think it's something like ( OH^2 = 9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.No, actually, I think it's ( OH^2 = 9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ). But wait, that doesn't seem quite right because if I plug in the values, ( 9 times 7^2 = 9 times 49 = 441 ), and subtracting 29 gives 412, which seems too large. Maybe I got the formula wrong.Let me think again. I remember Euler's formula in triangle geometry, which states that the distance between the circumcenter and orthocenter is related to the circumradius and other elements. Euler's formula is ( OH = 3 OG ), where ( G ) is the centroid. But I don't know if that helps directly here.Wait, there's another formula: ( OH^2 = 9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ). Let me verify this formula. I think it's actually ( OH^2 = 9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ). Let me check the units: both terms are squared lengths, so that seems okay.But wait, if ( R = 7 ), then ( 9R^2 = 9 times 49 = 441 ). Then subtracting ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ) gives ( OH^2 = 441 - 29 = 412 ). That seems quite large. Is that possible?Wait, maybe I have the formula backwards. Maybe it's ( OH^2 = 9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ). Let me confirm this formula.Looking it up in my mind, Euler's theorem states that ( OH^2 = 9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, plugging in the values:( OH^2 = 9 times 7^2 - 29 = 9 times 49 - 29 = 441 - 29 = 412 ).Wait, but 412 seems really large. Let me think about whether this makes sense. If the circumradius is 7, then the sides can't be too large, right? Because the circumradius relates to the sides via the formula ( a = 2R sin A ), and similarly for ( b ) and ( c ). So, the maximum possible side length would be ( 2R = 14 ), but in reality, the sides would be less than that.Given that ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ), which is much smaller than ( 3 times 14^2 = 588 ). So, the sides are actually quite small compared to the maximum possible.Wait, but if ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ), then each side squared is less than 29, so each side is less than ( sqrt{29} approx 5.385 ). But the circumradius is 7, which is larger than half of the sides. Wait, that doesn't make sense because in a triangle, the circumradius ( R ) is related to the sides by ( a = 2R sin A ), so ( sin A = a/(2R) ). If ( a ) is less than ( sqrt{29} approx 5.385 ), then ( sin A < 5.385/(2 times 7) approx 5.385/14 approx 0.385 ). So, angle ( A ) would be less than about 22.7 degrees. Similarly for the other angles.But wait, if all angles are less than 22.7 degrees, that would mean the triangle is very \\"flat\\", but that contradicts the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, that can't be right. Therefore, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.Wait, no, actually, the formula ( a = 2R sin A ) implies that ( a ) can be up to ( 2R ), but in this case, ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ), which is much less than ( (2R)^2 times 3 = 4 times 49 times 3 = 588 ). So, the sides are indeed much smaller than the maximum possible.But then, if the sides are small, how come the circumradius is 7? That seems contradictory because a larger circumradius usually corresponds to larger sides.Wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me recall that in a triangle, the circumradius ( R = frac{abc}{4K} ), where ( K ) is the area. So, if ( R ) is 7, then ( abc = 28K ). But without knowing more about the triangle, it's hard to say.Alternatively, maybe I can use another formula for ( OH^2 ). I remember that ( OH^2 = 4R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ). Wait, is that correct? Let me think.No, that formula doesn't seem right because if ( OH^2 = 4R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ), then plugging in ( R = 7 ) and ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ) would give ( OH^2 = 4 times 49 - 29 = 196 - 29 = 167 ). But I'm not sure if that's the correct formula.Wait, maybe I should derive the formula for ( OH^2 ) to make sure. Let me recall that in triangle geometry, the vector from the circumcenter ( O ) to the orthocenter ( H ) is given by ( vec{OH} = 3vec{OG} ), where ( G ) is the centroid. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Alternatively, I remember that in coordinate geometry, if we place the circumcenter at the origin, then the coordinates of the orthocenter can be expressed in terms of the coordinates of the vertices. But that might be more complicated.Wait, another approach: using the formula ( OH^2 = 9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ). Let me verify this formula with an equilateral triangle. In an equilateral triangle, ( O ) and ( H ) coincide, so ( OH = 0 ). Let's see if the formula gives 0.For an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so ( a = b = c ). Let ( a = b = c = s ). Then ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3s^2 ). The circumradius ( R = frac{s}{sqrt{3}} ). So, ( 9R^2 = 9 times frac{s^2}{3} = 3s^2 ). Therefore, ( 9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 3s^2 - 3s^2 = 0 ). That works. So, the formula seems correct for an equilateral triangle.Another test: right-angled triangle. Let's say triangle with sides 3, 4, 5. Then ( R = frac{5}{2} = 2.5 ). The orthocenter in a right-angled triangle is at the vertex of the right angle, so ( H ) coincides with the vertex. The circumcenter is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, so ( O ) is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse.So, the distance between ( O ) and ( H ) is the distance from the midpoint of the hypotenuse to the right-angled vertex. In a 3-4-5 triangle, the midpoint of the hypotenuse is at (1.5, 2) if we place the right angle at (0,0), and the other vertices at (3,0) and (0,4). So, the distance from (1.5, 2) to (0,0) is ( sqrt{(1.5)^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{2.25 + 4} = sqrt{6.25} = 2.5 ). Therefore, ( OH = 2.5 ), so ( OH^2 = 6.25 ).Now, let's apply the formula: ( 9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ). Here, ( R = 2.5 ), so ( 9R^2 = 9 times 6.25 = 56.25 ). ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 9 + 16 + 25 = 50 ). So, ( 56.25 - 50 = 6.25 ), which matches ( OH^2 ). So, the formula works here as well.Therefore, I can be confident that the formula ( OH^2 = 9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ) is correct.So, plugging in the given values: ( R = 7 ), so ( 9R^2 = 9 times 49 = 441 ). ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ). Therefore, ( OH^2 = 441 - 29 = 412 ).Wait, but earlier I thought 412 seemed too large. Let me think again. If ( R = 7 ), then the sides can be up to 14, but in this case, the sum of their squares is only 29, which is much smaller. So, the sides are actually quite small. But the circumradius is 7, which is quite large relative to the sides.Wait, but in a triangle, the circumradius can be large even if the sides are small if the triangle is very \\"flat\\", meaning it's almost degenerate. For example, if two sides are very small and the third is almost 14, then the circumradius can be 7. But in this case, the sum of the squares is 29, which is much less than ( 14^2 = 196 ). So, maybe the triangle is not that flat.Wait, let me calculate the maximum possible value of ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ) given ( R = 7 ). The maximum occurs when the triangle is equilateral, right? Because in an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so ( a = b = c = 2R sin 60^circ = 2 times 7 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 7sqrt{3} approx 12.124 ). Therefore, ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3 times (7sqrt{3})^2 = 3 times 147 = 441 ). So, the maximum possible sum is 441, which is exactly ( 9R^2 ). So, in that case, ( OH^2 = 441 - 441 = 0 ), which makes sense because in an equilateral triangle, ( O ) and ( H ) coincide.In our problem, ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ), which is much less than 441, so the triangle is far from equilateral. Therefore, ( OH^2 = 441 - 29 = 412 ) is indeed the correct value.Wait, but 412 is a large number. Let me see if that's possible. If ( OH^2 = 412 ), then ( OH approx sqrt{412} approx 20.297 ). But the circumradius is only 7, so the distance between ( O ) and ( H ) is about 20.3, which is much larger than the circumradius. Is that possible?Wait, in a triangle, the orthocenter can lie outside the triangle, especially in obtuse triangles. So, if the triangle is very obtuse, the orthocenter can be far away from the circumcenter. So, maybe it's possible for ( OH ) to be larger than ( R ).Wait, let me think about the Euler line. The Euler line connects ( O ), ( G ), and ( H ), with ( OG : GH = 1:2 ). So, ( OH = 3 OG ). If ( OH ) is 20.3, then ( OG ) is about 6.77, which is less than ( R = 7 ). That seems plausible.Alternatively, let me consider a triangle where ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ) and ( R = 7 ). Let me try to find such a triangle.Suppose we have a triangle with sides ( a = 3 ), ( b = 4 ), and ( c = sqrt{29 - 9 - 16} = sqrt{4} = 2 ). Wait, but 3, 4, 2 is not a valid triangle because 2 + 3 = 5 < 4, which violates the triangle inequality. So, that's not possible.Wait, maybe another set. Let me try ( a = 5 ), ( b = 2 ), then ( c^2 = 29 - 25 - 4 = 0 ). That's not possible either.Wait, maybe ( a = 4 ), ( b = 3 ), then ( c^2 = 29 - 16 - 9 = 4 ), so ( c = 2 ). Again, 2, 3, 4 is a valid triangle because 2 + 3 > 4, 3 + 4 > 2, and 2 + 4 > 3. So, such a triangle exists.Wait, but in this case, the triangle is 2, 3, 4. Let me compute its circumradius. Using the formula ( R = frac{abc}{4K} ), where ( K ) is the area.First, compute the semi-perimeter ( s = frac{2 + 3 + 4}{2} = 4.5 ).Then, area ( K = sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} = sqrt{4.5 times 2.5 times 1.5 times 0.5} ).Calculating inside the square root: ( 4.5 times 2.5 = 11.25 ), ( 1.5 times 0.5 = 0.75 ), so total is ( 11.25 times 0.75 = 8.4375 ). Therefore, ( K = sqrt{8.4375} approx 2.9047 ).Then, ( R = frac{2 times 3 times 4}{4 times 2.9047} = frac{24}{11.6188} approx 2.066 ). But in our problem, ( R = 7 ), so this triangle doesn't satisfy the given conditions.Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let me consider that in any triangle, ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(s^2 - r^2 - 4Rr) ) or something like that? Wait, no, I think I'm mixing formulas.Wait, actually, another formula: ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(s^2 - r^2 - 4Rr) ). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that in any triangle, ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(s^2 - r^2 - 4Rr) ). Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another relation.Alternatively, I know that ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(s^2 - r^2 - 4Rr) ) is not correct. Let me think differently.Wait, another formula: ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2p^2 - 2r^2 - 8Rr ), where ( p ) is the semi-perimeter. Hmm, not sure.Wait, perhaps it's better to use vector coordinates. Let me place the circumcenter at the origin. Then, the position vectors of the vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) satisfy ( |OA| = |OB| = |OC| = R = 7 ).The orthocenter ( H ) has the position vector ( vec{OH} = vec{OA} + vec{OB} + vec{OC} ). Wait, is that correct? No, actually, in vector terms, the orthocenter ( H ) can be expressed as ( vec{OH} = vec{OA} + vec{OB} + vec{OC} ) only in specific cases, like when the circumcenter is at the origin. Wait, no, that's not generally true.Wait, actually, in general, the orthocenter can be expressed as ( vec{OH} = vec{OA} + vec{OB} + vec{OC} ) if and only if the circumcenter is at the origin. But I think that's only true for certain triangles, like acute triangles. Wait, no, actually, in general, the formula is ( vec{OH} = vec{OA} + vec{OB} + vec{OC} ) when the circumcenter is at the origin. Let me confirm.Yes, in the coordinate system where the circumcenter is at the origin, the orthocenter ( H ) has coordinates ( (x_A + x_B + x_C, y_A + y_B + y_C) ). So, ( vec{OH} = vec{OA} + vec{OB} + vec{OC} ).Therefore, the square of the distance ( OH^2 ) is equal to ( |vec{OH}|^2 = |vec{OA} + vec{OB} + vec{OC}|^2 ).Expanding this, we get:( |vec{OA} + vec{OB} + vec{OC}|^2 = |vec{OA}|^2 + |vec{OB}|^2 + |vec{OC}|^2 + 2(vec{OA} cdot vec{OB} + vec{OA} cdot vec{OC} + vec{OB} cdot vec{OC}) ).Since ( |vec{OA}| = |vec{OB}| = |vec{OC}| = R = 7 ), the first three terms are each ( 49 ), so together they sum to ( 3 times 49 = 147 ).Now, the dot products ( vec{OA} cdot vec{OB} ), ( vec{OA} cdot vec{OC} ), and ( vec{OB} cdot vec{OC} ) can be expressed in terms of the angles between the vectors. Specifically, ( vec{OA} cdot vec{OB} = |OA||OB|cos angle AOB = R^2 cos angle AOB ).But ( angle AOB ) is the central angle corresponding to side ( AB ), which is equal to ( 2C ), where ( C ) is the angle at vertex ( C ) in triangle ( ABC ). Similarly, ( angle AOC = 2B ) and ( angle BOC = 2A ).Therefore, ( vec{OA} cdot vec{OB} = R^2 cos 2C ), ( vec{OA} cdot vec{OC} = R^2 cos 2B ), and ( vec{OB} cdot vec{OC} = R^2 cos 2A ).So, putting it all together:( OH^2 = 147 + 2R^2 (cos 2A + cos 2B + cos 2C) ).Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe we can relate it to the given ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ).Wait, I also know that ( a = 2R sin A ), ( b = 2R sin B ), ( c = 2R sin C ). Therefore, ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4R^2 (sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C) ).Given that ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ) and ( R = 7 ), we have:( 29 = 4 times 49 (sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C) ).Simplifying, ( 29 = 196 (sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C) ), so ( sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C = frac{29}{196} approx 0.148 ).Hmm, that seems very small. Wait, but in any triangle, ( sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C ) has a minimum value. Let me recall that in a triangle, ( A + B + C = pi ), so we can use some trigonometric identities.I know that ( sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C = 2 + 2cos A cos B cos C ). Wait, is that correct? Let me check.No, actually, the identity is ( sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C = 2 + 2cos A cos B cos C ) for a triangle. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because for an equilateral triangle, each angle is ( 60^circ ), so ( sin^2 60^circ = frac{3}{4} ), so sum is ( frac{9}{4} = 2.25 ). Plugging into the identity: ( 2 + 2 times (frac{1}{2})^3 = 2 + 2 times frac{1}{8} = 2 + frac{1}{4} = 2.25 ). So, yes, the identity holds.Therefore, ( sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C = 2 + 2cos A cos B cos C ).Given that ( sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C = frac{29}{196} approx 0.148 ), which is much less than 2.25, which is the value for an equilateral triangle. Wait, that can't be right because ( 0.148 ) is much less than 2.25, but in reality, ( sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C ) must be greater than or equal to something.Wait, actually, in any triangle, the sum ( sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C ) is always greater than or equal to ( frac{3}{4} times 3 = frac{9}{4} = 2.25 ) for an equilateral triangle, but in our case, it's ( frac{29}{196} approx 0.148 ), which is way too small. That suggests that my earlier approach might be flawed.Wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.We have ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ), and ( a = 2R sin A ), so ( a^2 = 4R^2 sin^2 A ). Therefore, ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4R^2 (sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C) ).Given ( R = 7 ), ( 4R^2 = 4 times 49 = 196 ). Therefore, ( 196 (sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C) = 29 ). So, ( sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C = frac{29}{196} approx 0.148 ).But as I thought earlier, this is impossible because in any triangle, the sum of the squares of the sines of the angles must be at least something. Wait, actually, let me compute the minimum possible value.In a degenerate triangle where one angle approaches 180 degrees, the other two angles approach 0 degrees. So, ( sin^2 180^circ = 0 ), and ( sin^2 0^circ = 0 ). So, the sum approaches 0. But in reality, for a non-degenerate triangle, the angles must each be greater than 0 and less than 180, so the sum ( sin^2 A + sin^2 B + sin^2 C ) must be greater than 0.Wait, but in our case, it's ( approx 0.148 ), which is very small, but not impossible. It just means that the triangle is very \\"flat\\", with one angle approaching 180 degrees and the other two approaching 0 degrees.But in such a triangle, the circumradius ( R ) would be very large because ( R = frac{a}{2 sin A} ), and if angle ( A ) is approaching 0 degrees, ( sin A ) approaches 0, making ( R ) very large. But in our case, ( R = 7 ), which is fixed. So, maybe such a triangle is possible.Wait, but if the triangle is very flat, then the orthocenter would be far away from the circumcenter, which would make ( OH ) large, which is consistent with our earlier result of ( OH^2 = 412 ).Therefore, despite the small sum of squares of the sines, the triangle is possible with ( R = 7 ) and ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 ), and the distance ( OH ) is indeed ( sqrt{412} ).Therefore, after all this thinking and verifying, I can conclude that ( OH^2 = 412 ).**Final Answer**boxed{412}"},{"question":"John buys 30 ducks for 10 each.

The question is asking for the eccentricity of that ellipse, and the options are given as fractions and square roots, which suggests it's a standard value.First, let me recall what a dihedral angle is. A dihedral angle is the angle between two planes. In this case, the dihedral angle between planes α and β is 30 degrees. So, if I imagine two planes intersecting along a line, the angle between them is 30 degrees.Now, the problem mentions an orthogonal projection of a circle in plane α onto plane β. Orthogonal projection means projecting the circle along lines perpendicular to plane β. I remember that when you project a circle onto another plane, the result is an ellipse, unless the planes are parallel, in which case it's still a circle.So, the projection of a circle onto another plane at an angle will result in an ellipse. The eccentricity of this ellipse depends on the angle between the planes. I need to find the relationship between the dihedral angle and the eccentricity.Let me think about how the projection works. If the circle is in plane α, and we project it orthogonally onto plane β, the shape becomes an ellipse. The major axis of the ellipse will be along the direction where the projection doesn't change the length, and the minor axis will be compressed.Wait, actually, no. The projection will compress the circle along the direction perpendicular to the line of intersection of the two planes. So, the major axis remains the same as the original circle's diameter, and the minor axis is scaled by the cosine of the angle between the planes.But I need to be careful here. The dihedral angle is 30 degrees, which is the angle between the two planes. So, if I have a circle in plane α, and I project it onto plane β, which is inclined at 30 degrees, the projection will stretch or compress the circle.Wait, actually, when you project a circle onto a plane at an angle θ, the minor axis of the resulting ellipse is equal to the radius of the circle times cosθ, and the major axis remains the radius. So, the semi-major axis, a, is equal to the original radius, r, and the semi-minor axis, b, is equal to r cosθ.Therefore, the eccentricity e of the ellipse is given by e = sqrt(1 - (b/a)^2). Plugging in b = r cosθ and a = r, we get e = sqrt(1 - cos²θ) = sinθ.Wait, that seems too straightforward. So, if the dihedral angle is 30 degrees, then θ is 30 degrees, so e = sin(30°) = 1/2. So, the eccentricity is 1/2, which is option B.But hold on, is θ the dihedral angle or something else? Let me double-check.The dihedral angle is the angle between the two planes. When projecting a circle from one plane to another, the angle between the planes affects the projection. If the dihedral angle is θ, then the angle between the normal vectors of the planes is also θ. But how does this relate to the projection?Alternatively, maybe the angle between the planes is the angle between their normals, which is 30 degrees. So, if I have a circle in plane α, and I project it onto plane β, which is at a dihedral angle of 30 degrees, then the scaling factor is cosθ, where θ is the angle between the planes.Wait, so if the dihedral angle is 30 degrees, then the angle between the normals is 30 degrees, but the angle between the planes themselves is 30 degrees. So, when projecting, the compression factor is cos(30°), which is sqrt(3)/2.But hold on, if the dihedral angle is 30 degrees, then the angle between the planes is 30 degrees, so the angle between the normals is 180 - 30 = 150 degrees? Wait, no, the dihedral angle is the angle between the two planes, which is the same as the angle between their normals if measured appropriately.Wait, actually, the dihedral angle is the angle between the two planes, which is equal to the angle between their normals. So, if the dihedral angle is 30 degrees, the normals are at 30 degrees to each other.But when projecting, the projection of the circle onto the other plane would involve the angle between the planes. So, if the dihedral angle is 30 degrees, then the projection would be scaled by cos(30°), which is sqrt(3)/2.Wait, so the semi-minor axis is r cosθ, where θ is 30 degrees, so b = r * sqrt(3)/2. The semi-major axis remains r, so a = r.Therefore, the eccentricity e = sqrt(1 - (b/a)^2) = sqrt(1 - (3/4)) = sqrt(1/4) = 1/2. So, e = 1/2, which is option B.But wait, let me think again. If the dihedral angle is 30 degrees, is the angle between the planes 30 degrees, or is it the angle between the normals? Because sometimes dihedral angle is defined as the angle between the planes, which is the same as the angle between their normals if measured appropriately.But in projection, the scaling factor is related to the angle between the projection direction and the plane. Since we are projecting orthogonally onto plane β, the projection is along the normal of plane β. So, the angle between the normal of plane β and plane α is 30 degrees.Wait, maybe it's better to visualize this.Imagine two planes intersecting at a dihedral angle of 30 degrees. Let me set up a coordinate system where plane α is the xy-plane, and plane β is inclined at 30 degrees around the x-axis. So, the normal vector of plane α is along the z-axis, and the normal vector of plane β is at 30 degrees from the z-axis.Now, if I have a circle in plane α, say in the xy-plane, and I project it orthogonally onto plane β, which is inclined at 30 degrees. The projection will result in an ellipse.The major axis of the ellipse will be along the direction where the projection doesn't compress the circle, and the minor axis will be compressed.Wait, actually, the projection will scale the circle by a factor of cos(30°) along the direction perpendicular to the line of intersection. So, the minor axis is scaled by cos(30°), and the major axis remains the same.Therefore, the semi-major axis a is equal to the radius of the circle, and the semi-minor axis b is equal to a * cos(30°).So, the eccentricity e is sqrt(1 - (b/a)^2) = sqrt(1 - cos²(30°)) = sin(30°) = 1/2.So, that's consistent with my earlier result.Alternatively, if I think about the parametric equations of the projection.Suppose the circle in plane α has radius r, centered at the origin. Let's parameterize the circle as (r cosθ, r sinθ, 0) in plane α.Now, to project this onto plane β, which is inclined at 30 degrees. Let's define plane β such that its normal vector makes a 30-degree angle with the normal vector of plane α.Assuming plane α is the xy-plane, the normal vector is (0,0,1). Plane β can be represented as a plane with normal vector (0, sin30°, cos30°) = (0, 1/2, sqrt(3)/2).The orthogonal projection of a point (x, y, z) onto plane β can be calculated by moving along the normal vector until it reaches plane β. But since we're projecting from plane α, which is the xy-plane, z=0, onto plane β, which is inclined.Wait, maybe it's better to use a coordinate transformation.Let me consider rotating the coordinate system by 30 degrees around the x-axis so that plane β becomes the new xy-plane. Then, the projection would be similar to projecting onto the new xy-plane.But I might be overcomplicating.Alternatively, the projection of a circle onto another plane can be found by considering the angle between the planes. The projection will result in an ellipse with semi-major axis a = r and semi-minor axis b = r cosθ, where θ is the angle between the planes.Therefore, the eccentricity e = sqrt(1 - (b/a)^2) = sqrt(1 - cos²θ) = sinθ.Since θ is 30 degrees, e = sin30° = 1/2.Therefore, the answer should be B, 1/2.But wait, let me verify this with another approach.Suppose I have a unit circle in plane α. The projection onto plane β will stretch or compress the circle depending on the angle between the planes.The area of the ellipse is πab, where a and b are the semi-axes. The area of the original circle is πr². The area of the projection is πab = πr² cosθ, since the area scales by the cosine of the angle between the planes.But wait, for orthogonal projection, the area scales by the cosine of the angle between the planes. So, if the original area is π, the projected area is π cosθ.But for an ellipse, the area is πab. So, πab = π cosθ => ab = cosθ.But in our case, a = 1 (since the original circle has radius 1), so b = cosθ.Therefore, the semi-minor axis is cosθ, and the semi-major axis is 1.Thus, the eccentricity e = sqrt(1 - b²) = sqrt(1 - cos²θ) = sinθ.So, again, e = sin30° = 1/2.Therefore, the eccentricity is 1/2, which is option B.Wait, but hold on a second. I think I might have confused the angle here. The dihedral angle is 30 degrees, but is θ the angle between the planes or the angle between the normals?Wait, if the dihedral angle is 30 degrees, that's the angle between the two planes. The angle between the normals would be 180 - 30 = 150 degrees, but in terms of projection, we usually consider the acute angle between the planes, which is 30 degrees.But in the projection, the scaling factor is cosθ, where θ is the angle between the planes. So, if the dihedral angle is 30 degrees, then θ is 30 degrees, so the scaling factor is cos30°, which is sqrt(3)/2.Wait, but in the earlier reasoning, I considered that the semi-minor axis is r cosθ, which would make e = sinθ.But if the scaling factor is cosθ, then the semi-minor axis is r cosθ, so e = sqrt(1 - cos²θ) = sinθ.But if θ is 30 degrees, then e = 1/2.Alternatively, if the angle between the normals is 30 degrees, then the angle between the planes is 150 degrees, which is obtuse. But in that case, the projection would be scaled by cos(150°), which is negative, but we take the absolute value, so it's sqrt(3)/2.Wait, no, the angle between the planes is defined as the smallest angle between them, so it's 30 degrees, not 150.Therefore, the angle θ is 30 degrees, so e = sin30° = 1/2.So, I think my initial conclusion is correct.But just to make sure, let me think about the projection in terms of vectors.Suppose I have a vector in plane α, which is being projected onto plane β. The projection of the vector onto plane β can be found by subtracting the component of the vector along the normal of plane β.If the angle between the normals is θ, then the projection of a vector in plane α onto plane β would have a magnitude scaled by cosθ.Wait, no, the projection of a vector onto a plane is equal to the original vector minus the component along the normal. So, if the angle between the normals is θ, then the component along the normal is |v| cosθ, so the projection onto the plane is |v| sinθ.Wait, that seems conflicting with earlier.Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.If I have a vector in plane α, and I project it onto plane β, the length of the projection is |v| sinθ, where θ is the angle between the normals.Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion.Wait, let's think carefully.Let me denote n_alpha as the normal vector of plane α, and n_beta as the normal vector of plane β. The angle between n_alpha and n_beta is θ, which is the dihedral angle, 30 degrees.Now, take a vector v in plane α. The projection of v onto plane β is given by v_proj = v - (v · n_beta / |n_beta|²) n_beta.Since n_beta is a unit vector, this simplifies to v_proj = v - (v · n_beta) n_beta.The magnitude squared of v_proj is |v_proj|² = |v|² - (v · n_beta)².But since v is in plane α, it is perpendicular to n_alpha. So, v · n_alpha = 0.But n_alpha and n_beta have an angle θ between them, so n_alpha · n_beta = cosθ.But how does this relate to v · n_beta?Wait, since v is in plane α, it's perpendicular to n_alpha, so v · n_alpha = 0.But n_beta can be expressed in terms of n_alpha and another vector.Let me consider a coordinate system where n_alpha is along the z-axis, so n_alpha = (0,0,1). Then, n_beta makes an angle θ with n_alpha, so n_beta = (0, sinθ, cosθ).Now, take a vector v in plane α, which is the xy-plane. So, v = (x, y, 0).Then, v · n_beta = x*0 + y*sinθ + 0*cosθ = y sinθ.Therefore, the projection of v onto plane β is v_proj = (x, y, 0) - (y sinθ)(0, sinθ, cosθ) = (x, y - y sin²θ, - y sinθ cosθ).Wait, but this seems complicated. Let me compute the magnitude squared of v_proj.|v_proj|² = x² + (y - y sin²θ)^2 + (- y sinθ cosθ)^2.Simplify:= x² + y²(1 - sin²θ)^2 + y² sin²θ cos²θ.Factor out y²:= x² + y²[(1 - sin²θ)^2 + sin²θ cos²θ].Simplify inside the brackets:(1 - sin²θ)^2 + sin²θ cos²θ = cos⁴θ + sin²θ cos²θ = cos²θ (cos²θ + sin²θ) = cos²θ.Therefore, |v_proj|² = x² + y² cos²θ.But since v is in plane α, which is the xy-plane, |v|² = x² + y².So, |v_proj|² = x² + y² cos²θ.Therefore, the projection of the vector v onto plane β has magnitude squared equal to x² + y² cos²θ.Now, if the original vector v is a radius vector of the circle in plane α, then x² + y² = r².So, |v_proj|² = r² - y² (1 - cos²θ) = r² - y² sin²θ.Wait, that doesn't seem immediately helpful.Alternatively, considering the maximum and minimum lengths of the projection.The maximum occurs when y = 0, so |v_proj| = r.The minimum occurs when x = 0, so |v_proj| = r cosθ.Therefore, the projection of the circle onto plane β is an ellipse with semi-major axis a = r and semi-minor axis b = r cosθ.Therefore, the eccentricity e = sqrt(1 - (b/a)^2) = sqrt(1 - cos²θ) = sinθ.Since θ is 30 degrees, e = sin30° = 1/2.So, that's consistent with my previous reasoning.Therefore, the eccentricity is 1/2, which is option B.Just to make sure, let me consider the case where the dihedral angle is 0 degrees. Then, the planes are the same, so the projection is a circle, and the eccentricity is 0, which makes sense because sin0° = 0.If the dihedral angle is 90 degrees, then the projection would be a line segment, which is an ellipse with eccentricity 1, since sin90° = 1. That also makes sense because projecting a circle onto a perpendicular plane would collapse it into a line.Therefore, the formula e = sinθ holds, where θ is the dihedral angle between the planes.Hence, for θ = 30°, e = 1/2.So, the answer is B) 1/2.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"For the equation x^{2}-4x+m=0, if one root is -1, then the other root is ______.","answer":"To determine the other root of the equation ( x^{2} - 4x + m = 0 ) when one root is (-1), I can use the properties of quadratic equations.First, I recall that for a quadratic equation ( ax^{2} + bx + c = 0 ), the sum of the roots is given by ( -frac{b}{a} ) and the product of the roots is ( frac{c}{a} ).In this case, the equation is ( x^{2} - 4x + m = 0 ), so ( a = 1 ), ( b = -4 ), and ( c = m ).Let the roots be ( r_{1} ) and ( r_{2} ).

The first equation has coefficients (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ldots, 7^2), the second equation has coefficients starting from (2^2) up to (8^2), and the third equation starts from (3^2) up to (9^2). The expression we need to find is the next in this sequence, starting from (4^2) up to (10^2).So, if I denote equation (1) as corresponding to (k=1), equation (2) as (k=2), equation (3) as (k=3), and the expression we need to find as (k=4), there might be a pattern or a recurrence relation here.Let me define ( S(k) ) as the sum:[S(k) = (k)^2 x_1 + (k+1)^2 x_2 + (k+2)^2 x_3 + ldots + (k+6)^2 x_7]So, according to this, equation (1) is ( S(1) = 1 ), equation (2) is ( S(2) = 12 ), equation (3) is ( S(3) = 123 ), and we need to find ( S(4) ).If I can find a pattern or a recurrence relation for ( S(k) ), I can predict ( S(4) ) based on the previous values. Let me compute the differences between consecutive ( S(k) ) terms.First, compute ( S(2) - S(1) ):[12 - 1 = 11]Then, compute ( S(3) - S(2) ):[123 - 12 = 111]So, the first difference is 11, the second difference is 111. Let me see if these differences follow a pattern.Compute the second difference:[111 - 11 = 100]Hmm, 100 is a perfect square, but I'm not sure if that helps yet. Maybe I should look for a polynomial that fits the given ( S(k) ) values.Assuming that ( S(k) ) is a polynomial in ( k ), let's say of degree ( n ). The number of points we have is 3, so the maximum degree we can uniquely determine is 2 (quadratic). Let's test if a quadratic polynomial fits.Let me assume:[S(k) = ak^2 + bk + c]We have three equations:1. When ( k=1 ): ( a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 1 ) → ( a + b + c = 1 )2. When ( k=2 ): ( a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 12 ) → ( 4a + 2b + c = 12 )3. When ( k=3 ): ( a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 123 ) → ( 9a + 3b + c = 123 )Now, let's solve this system of equations.First, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:[(4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 12 - 1 3a + b = 11 quad text{(Equation 5)}]Next, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:[(9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 123 - 12 5a + b = 111 quad text{(Equation 6)}]Now, subtract equation 5 from equation 6:[(5a + b) - (3a + b) = 111 - 11 2a = 100 a = 50]Plugging ( a = 50 ) into equation 5:[3(50) + b = 11 150 + b = 11 b = 11 - 150 b = -139]Now, plug ( a = 50 ) and ( b = -139 ) into equation 1:[50 - 139 + c = 1 -89 + c = 1 c = 1 + 89 c = 90]So, the quadratic polynomial is:[S(k) = 50k^2 - 139k + 90]Let me verify this with the given values.For ( k=1 ):[50(1)^2 - 139(1) + 90 = 50 - 139 + 90 = 1 quad text{Correct}]For ( k=2 ):[50(4) - 139(2) + 90 = 200 - 278 + 90 = 12 quad text{Correct}]For ( k=3 ):[50(9) - 139(3) + 90 = 450 - 417 + 90 = 123 quad text{Correct}]Great, so the polynomial fits the given data points. Now, to find ( S(4) ), plug ( k=4 ) into the polynomial:[S(4) = 50(16) - 139(4) + 90]Compute each term:- ( 50 times 16 = 800 )- ( 139 times 4 = 556 )- So, ( 800 - 556 + 90 )Compute step by step:- ( 800 - 556 = 244 )- ( 244 + 90 = 334 )Therefore, ( S(4) = 334 ).Wait, but before I conclude, let me think if this approach is valid. I assumed that ( S(k) ) is a quadratic polynomial, which is a common approach when dealing with sequences and finite differences. Since I had three points, a quadratic is the minimal degree polynomial that can fit three points, and it worked out perfectly. So, unless there is a reason to believe that the relationship isn't polynomial, this should be the correct answer.Alternatively, another approach is to consider the system of equations as a linear system and solve for the variables ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_7 ). However, with seven variables and only three equations, that system is underdetermined, meaning there are infinitely many solutions. Therefore, without additional constraints, we can't uniquely determine each ( x_i ). But since the problem is asking for a specific linear combination, which is another equation in the same sequence, it's likely that the sequence follows a polynomial pattern, allowing us to predict the next term without knowing each variable individually.Therefore, I feel confident that the value of ( 16x_1 + 25x_2 + 36x_3 + 49x_4 + 64x_5 + 81x_6 + 100x_7 ) is 334.**Final Answer**boxed{334}"},{"question":"Given vectors a=(1,2) and b=(3,1), find the coordinates of a+b and the value of a cdot b.","answer":"First, I need to find the sum of vectors ( a ) and ( b ).

Let me try to parse it step by step. Last academic year, the professors gave 6480 failing grades. Then, in the next year, the number of professors increased by 3, and each professor started giving more failing grades. As a result, the total failing grades went up to 11200. I need to find out how many professors there were originally, given that each professor gives the same number of failing grades per session.Hmm, okay. Let me define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the original number of professors is ( p ). Each professor gives ( f ) failing grades per session. So, last year, the total failing grades would be ( p times f = 6480 ).In the next academic year, the number of professors increased by 3, so now there are ( p + 3 ) professors. Each of these professors gave more failing grades. Let me denote the new number of failing grades per professor as ( f' ). So, the total failing grades this year would be ( (p + 3) times f' = 11200 ).I need another equation to relate these variables. The problem says each professor gave more failing grades in the next year. So, ( f' > f ). But I don't know by how much. Hmm, maybe I can express ( f' ) in terms of ( f ). Let me think.Wait, maybe I can express ( f' ) as ( f + x ), where ( x ) is the increase in failing grades per professor. So, ( f' = f + x ). But I don't know ( x ) either. Hmm, that might complicate things. Maybe there's another way.Alternatively, perhaps the total failing grades increased by a certain factor. Last year it was 6480, this year it's 11200. Maybe I can find the ratio of the total failing grades and relate it to the number of professors and the increase per professor.Let me write down the two equations:1. ( p times f = 6480 )  2. ( (p + 3) times f' = 11200 )I need another relationship. Maybe the increase in failing grades per professor is proportional to the increase in the number of professors? Or perhaps it's a fixed number? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to find a relationship that allows me to solve for ( p ).Wait, maybe I can express ( f' ) in terms of ( f ). Since each professor gave more failing grades, and the total increased, perhaps the ratio of total failing grades can be related to the ratio of professors and the ratio of failing grades per professor.So, ( frac{11200}{6480} = frac{(p + 3)}{p} times frac{f'}{f} )Let me compute ( frac{11200}{6480} ). Let's see, 11200 divided by 6480. Let me simplify this fraction. Both numbers are divisible by 160? Let me check: 11200 ÷ 160 = 70, and 6480 ÷ 160 = 40.5. Hmm, not a whole number. Maybe divide numerator and denominator by 80: 11200 ÷ 80 = 140, 6480 ÷ 80 = 81. So, 140/81. That simplifies to approximately 1.728.So, ( frac{11200}{6480} = frac{140}{81} approx 1.728 )So, ( frac{140}{81} = frac{(p + 3)}{p} times frac{f'}{f} )But I don't know ( frac{f'}{f} ). Hmm, maybe I can express ( f' ) in terms of ( f ) using the fact that each professor gave more failing grades. But without knowing how much more, it's tricky.Wait, maybe I can express ( f ) from the first equation as ( f = frac{6480}{p} ), and ( f' = frac{11200}{p + 3} ). Then, since ( f' > f ), we have ( frac{11200}{p + 3} > frac{6480}{p} ).So, let me write that inequality:( frac{11200}{p + 3} > frac{6480}{p} )Cross-multiplying (since ( p ) and ( p + 3 ) are positive):( 11200p > 6480(p + 3) )Let me compute that:11200p > 6480p + 19440Subtract 6480p from both sides:11200p - 6480p > 194404720p > 19440Divide both sides by 4720:p > 19440 / 4720Let me compute that:19440 ÷ 4720. Let's see, 4720 x 4 = 18880. 19440 - 18880 = 560. So, 4 + 560/4720. Simplify 560/4720: divide numerator and denominator by 80: 7/59. So, approximately 4 + 0.1186 = 4.1186.So, p > approximately 4.1186. Since the number of professors must be an integer, p must be at least 5.But that's just an inequality. I need an exact value.Wait, maybe I can set up the ratio equation I had earlier:( frac{140}{81} = frac{(p + 3)}{p} times frac{f'}{f} )But I also know that ( f' = frac{11200}{p + 3} ) and ( f = frac{6480}{p} ). So, ( frac{f'}{f} = frac{11200}{p + 3} times frac{p}{6480} )Simplify that:( frac{f'}{f} = frac{11200p}{6480(p + 3)} )Simplify the constants:11200 / 6480 = 140 / 81, as before.So, ( frac{f'}{f} = frac{140p}{81(p + 3)} )So, plugging back into the ratio equation:( frac{140}{81} = frac{(p + 3)}{p} times frac{140p}{81(p + 3)} )Wait, let me write that out:( frac{140}{81} = frac{(p + 3)}{p} times frac{140p}{81(p + 3)} )Simplify the right-hand side:The (p + 3) cancels out, and the p cancels out, so we have:( frac{140}{81} = frac{140}{81} )Hmm, that's just an identity, which doesn't help me find p. So, that approach doesn't give me new information.Hmm, maybe I need another approach. Let's think about the total failing grades. Last year, it was 6480 with p professors. This year, it's 11200 with p + 3 professors, each giving more failing grades.So, perhaps the increase in total failing grades is due to both the increase in the number of professors and the increase in failing grades per professor.Let me denote the increase in failing grades per professor as x. So, each professor now gives f + x failing grades.So, total failing grades this year would be (p + 3)(f + x) = 11200.We know that last year, p*f = 6480.So, we have two equations:1. p*f = 6480  2. (p + 3)(f + x) = 11200But we have three variables: p, f, x. So, I need another equation or a way to relate these variables.Wait, maybe I can assume that the increase per professor is proportional to the original number? Or perhaps it's a fixed number? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to find integer solutions.Alternatively, perhaps the increase in failing grades per professor is the same as the increase in the number of professors, but that might not necessarily be the case.Wait, maybe I can express x in terms of f. Let me see.From equation 1: f = 6480 / p.From equation 2: (p + 3)(6480/p + x) = 11200.Let me expand equation 2:(p + 3)*(6480/p) + (p + 3)*x = 11200.Compute the first term:(p + 3)*(6480/p) = 6480 + (3*6480)/p = 6480 + 19440/p.So, equation 2 becomes:6480 + 19440/p + (p + 3)x = 11200.Subtract 6480 from both sides:19440/p + (p + 3)x = 11200 - 6480 = 4720.So,19440/p + (p + 3)x = 4720.Hmm, but I still have two variables here: p and x. So, unless I can express x in terms of p, I can't solve this.Wait, maybe I can express x as a multiple of f? Let's say x = k*f, where k is some constant greater than 0.Then, x = k*(6480/p).So, plugging back into the equation:19440/p + (p + 3)*(k*6480/p) = 4720.Factor out 6480/p:6480/p*(3 + k(p + 3)) = 4720.Wait, let me compute that step by step.Wait, 19440/p is equal to 3*6480/p, right? Because 3*6480 = 19440.So, 19440/p = 3*(6480/p) = 3f.Similarly, (p + 3)*x = (p + 3)*(k*f) = k*f*(p + 3).So, equation becomes:3f + k*f*(p + 3) = 4720.Factor out f:f*(3 + k(p + 3)) = 4720.But f = 6480/p, so:(6480/p)*(3 + k(p + 3)) = 4720.Multiply both sides by p:6480*(3 + k(p + 3)) = 4720p.Divide both sides by 8 to simplify:810*(3 + k(p + 3)) = 590p.Hmm, 6480 ÷ 8 = 810, 4720 ÷ 8 = 590.So, 810*(3 + k(p + 3)) = 590p.Hmm, this seems complicated because I still have two variables, k and p. Maybe I need another approach.Wait, perhaps I can assume that the increase in failing grades per professor is the same as the increase in the number of professors? That is, each professor increased their failing grades by 3? Hmm, that might not make sense, but let's try.If x = 3, then:From equation 2:(p + 3)(f + 3) = 11200.But we know that p*f = 6480, so f = 6480/p.So,(p + 3)(6480/p + 3) = 11200.Let me compute this:Multiply out:(p + 3)*(6480/p) + (p + 3)*3 = 11200.Which is:6480 + 19440/p + 3p + 9 = 11200.Combine constants:6480 + 9 = 6489.So,6489 + 19440/p + 3p = 11200.Subtract 6489:19440/p + 3p = 11200 - 6489 = 4711.So,19440/p + 3p = 4711.Multiply both sides by p:19440 + 3p² = 4711p.Bring all terms to one side:3p² - 4711p + 19440 = 0.Hmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:3p² - 4711p + 19440 = 0.Let me try to solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is p = [4711 ± sqrt(4711² - 4*3*19440)] / (2*3).First, compute the discriminant:D = 4711² - 4*3*19440.Compute 4711²:4711 * 4711. Let me compute this step by step.First, 4700² = (47)² * 100² = 2209 * 10000 = 22,090,000.Then, 4711² = (4700 + 11)² = 4700² + 2*4700*11 + 11² = 22,090,000 + 103,400 + 121 = 22,193,521.Now, compute 4*3*19440 = 12*19440 = 233,280.So, D = 22,193,521 - 233,280 = 21,960,241.Now, sqrt(21,960,241). Let me see, 4685² = ?Wait, 4685²: Let me compute 4685*4685.But maybe it's easier to note that 4685² = (4700 - 15)² = 4700² - 2*4700*15 + 15² = 22,090,000 - 141,000 + 225 = 21,949,225.Hmm, but D is 21,960,241, which is higher. So, 4685² = 21,949,225.Difference: 21,960,241 - 21,949,225 = 11,016.So, sqrt(21,960,241) is approximately 4685 + 11,016/(2*4685) ≈ 4685 + 11,016/9370 ≈ 4685 + 1.176 ≈ 4686.176.But let me check 4686²:4686² = (4685 + 1)² = 4685² + 2*4685 + 1 = 21,949,225 + 9,370 + 1 = 21,958,596.Still less than 21,960,241.Next, 4687² = 4686² + 2*4686 + 1 = 21,958,596 + 9,372 + 1 = 21,967,969.Wait, that's higher than D=21,960,241.So, sqrt(D) is between 4686 and 4687. Let me compute 4686.1²:4686.1² = (4686 + 0.1)² = 4686² + 2*4686*0.1 + 0.1² = 21,958,596 + 937.2 + 0.01 = 21,959,533.21.Still less than D=21,960,241.Difference: 21,960,241 - 21,959,533.21 = 707.79.So, approximately, sqrt(D) ≈ 4686.1 + 707.79/(2*4686.1) ≈ 4686.1 + 707.79/9372.2 ≈ 4686.1 + 0.0755 ≈ 4686.1755.So, approximately 4686.1755.So, p = [4711 ± 4686.1755]/6.Compute both possibilities:First, p = (4711 + 4686.1755)/6 ≈ (9397.1755)/6 ≈ 1566.1959.Second, p = (4711 - 4686.1755)/6 ≈ (24.8245)/6 ≈ 4.1374.So, p ≈ 1566.1959 or p ≈ 4.1374.But p must be an integer, and from earlier, p > 4.1186, so p must be at least 5. But 1566 seems way too high because 1566 professors giving 6480 failing grades would mean each professor gave less than 5 failing grades, which seems low. Whereas 4.1374 is less than 5, but p must be integer, so p=5.Wait, but p=5 would mean f=6480/5=1296 failing grades per professor, which seems high, but let's check.If p=5, then next year p+3=8 professors. Each professor gives f'=11200/8=1400 failing grades. So, each professor increased from 1296 to 1400, which is an increase of 104. That seems possible, but let's check if p=5 satisfies the quadratic equation.Wait, earlier I assumed x=3, but in reality, x=104. So, my assumption that x=3 was incorrect, which led me to the quadratic equation. So, maybe this approach isn't the right way.Alternatively, maybe I should try to find integer solutions for p such that both 6480/p and 11200/(p+3) are integers, since the number of failing grades per professor must be whole numbers.So, let's think about this. p must be a divisor of 6480, and p+3 must be a divisor of 11200.So, let's find the divisors of 6480 and 11200, and look for a pair where one is 3 more than the other.First, factorize 6480 and 11200.Factorizing 6480:6480 ÷ 10 = 648648 ÷ 2 = 324324 ÷ 2 = 162162 ÷ 2 = 8181 ÷ 3 = 2727 ÷ 3 = 99 ÷ 3 = 33 ÷ 3 = 1So, 6480 = 2^4 * 3^4 * 5^1.Similarly, factorizing 11200:11200 ÷ 100 = 112112 ÷ 16 = 7So, 11200 = 2^5 * 5^2 * 7^1.So, the divisors of 6480 are of the form 2^a * 3^b * 5^c, where a=0,1,2,3,4; b=0,1,2,3,4; c=0,1.Similarly, the divisors of 11200 are of the form 2^d * 5^e *7^f, where d=0,1,2,3,4,5; e=0,1,2; f=0,1.We need to find a divisor p of 6480 and a divisor q = p + 3 of 11200.So, let me list the possible divisors p of 6480, compute q = p + 3, and check if q divides 11200.Given that 6480 is a large number, it has many divisors. Let me see if I can find a reasonable p.Given that p must be such that p + 3 divides 11200, and p divides 6480.Let me list the possible q = p + 3, which must divide 11200, so q must be a divisor of 11200.Let me list the divisors of 11200:Since 11200 = 2^5 * 5^2 *7^1, the number of divisors is (5+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 6*3*2=36 divisors.That's a lot, but maybe I can list them in pairs:1, 11200  2, 5600  4, 2800  5, 2240  7, 1600  8, 1400  10, 1120  14, 800  16, 700  20, 560  25, 448  28, 400  32, 350  35, 320  40, 280  50, 224  56, 200  70, 160  80, 140  100, 112  112, 100  140, 80  160, 70  200, 56  224, 50  280, 40  320, 35  350, 32  400, 28  448, 25  560, 20  700, 16  800, 14  1120, 10  1400, 8  1600, 7  2240, 5  2800, 4  5600, 2  11200, 1Now, for each q in these divisors, compute p = q - 3, and check if p divides 6480.Let me go through the list:1. q=1, p= -2 → invalid  2. q=2, p= -1 → invalid  3. q=4, p=1 → 1 divides 6480? Yes, but p=1, let's check if f = 6480/1=6480, and f' = 11200/4=2800. But 2800 < 6480, which contradicts the fact that each professor gave more failing grades. So, invalid.  4. q=5, p=2 → p=2 divides 6480? Yes. f=3240, f'=2240. Again, f' < f. Invalid.  5. q=7, p=4 → p=4 divides 6480? Yes. f=1620, f'=1600. f' < f. Invalid.  6. q=8, p=5 → p=5 divides 6480? 6480 ÷ 5 = 1296. Yes. f=1296, f'=11200/8=1400. 1400 > 1296. Valid. So, p=5 is a possible solution. Let's check if this works.Wait, p=5, q=8.So, last year: 5 professors, each giving 1296 failing grades. Total: 5*1296=6480. Correct.This year: 8 professors, each giving 1400 failing grades. Total: 8*1400=11200. Correct.And 1400 > 1296, so each professor gave more failing grades. So, this seems to satisfy all conditions.But let's check other possible q's to see if there are more solutions.7. q=10, p=7 → p=7 divides 6480? 6480 ÷7 ≈925.714, not integer. So, invalid.  8. q=14, p=11 → p=11 divides 6480? 6480 ÷11 ≈589.09, not integer. Invalid.  9. q=16, p=13 → 6480 ÷13 ≈498.46, not integer. Invalid.  10. q=20, p=17 → 6480 ÷17 ≈381.18, not integer. Invalid.  11. q=25, p=22 → 6480 ÷22 ≈294.545, not integer. Invalid.  12. q=28, p=25 → 6480 ÷25=259.2, not integer. Invalid.  13. q=32, p=29 → 6480 ÷29≈223.45, not integer. Invalid.  14. q=35, p=32 → 6480 ÷32=202.5, not integer. Invalid.  15. q=40, p=37 → 6480 ÷37≈175.14, not integer. Invalid.  16. q=50, p=47 → 6480 ÷47≈137.87, not integer. Invalid.  17. q=56, p=53 → 6480 ÷53≈122.26, not integer. Invalid.  18. q=70, p=67 → 6480 ÷67≈96.72, not integer. Invalid.  19. q=80, p=77 → 6480 ÷77≈84.16, not integer. Invalid.  20. q=100, p=97 → 6480 ÷97≈66.80, not integer. Invalid.  21. q=112, p=109 → 6480 ÷109≈59.45, not integer. Invalid.  22. q=140, p=137 → 6480 ÷137≈47.23, not integer. Invalid.  23. q=160, p=157 → 6480 ÷157≈41.28, not integer. Invalid.  24. q=200, p=197 → 6480 ÷197≈32.89, not integer. Invalid.  25. q=224, p=221 → 6480 ÷221≈29.32, not integer. Invalid.  26. q=280, p=277 → 6480 ÷277≈23.39, not integer. Invalid.  27. q=320, p=317 → 6480 ÷317≈20.44, not integer. Invalid.  28. q=350, p=347 → 6480 ÷347≈18.67, not integer. Invalid.  29. q=400, p=397 → 6480 ÷397≈16.32, not integer. Invalid.  30. q=448, p=445 → 6480 ÷445≈14.56, not integer. Invalid.  31. q=560, p=557 → 6480 ÷557≈11.63, not integer. Invalid.  32. q=700, p=697 → 6480 ÷697≈9.29, not integer. Invalid.  33. q=800, p=797 → 6480 ÷797≈8.13, not integer. Invalid.  34. q=1120, p=1117 → 6480 ÷1117≈5.80, not integer. Invalid.  35. q=1400, p=1397 → 6480 ÷1397≈4.63, not integer. Invalid.  36. q=1600, p=1597 → 6480 ÷1597≈4.05, not integer. Invalid.  37. q=2240, p=2237 → 6480 ÷2237≈2.89, not integer. Invalid.  38. q=2800, p=2797 → 6480 ÷2797≈2.31, not integer. Invalid.  39. q=5600, p=5597 → 6480 ÷5597≈1.16, not integer. Invalid.  40. q=11200, p=11197 → 6480 ÷11197≈0.58, not integer. Invalid.So, the only valid solution is when q=8, p=5.Therefore, the original number of professors was 5.Wait, but let me double-check. If p=5, then f=6480/5=1296. Next year, p+3=8, f'=11200/8=1400. 1400 > 1296, so each professor gave more failing grades. That seems correct.But let me check if there are any other possible q's that I might have missed. For example, q=1400, p=1397. But 1397 is a prime number? I think so, and 6480 ÷1397 is not an integer. So, no.Similarly, q=700, p=697. 697 is 17*41, which doesn't divide 6480. So, no.So, the only solution is p=5.Therefore, the original number of professors was 5."},{"question":"Given ( p, q in mathbb{R}^{+} ), an infinite sequence (left{a_nright}) satisfies the conditions: ( a_1 = 1 ) and for any natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ), (left|a_{m+n} - a_m - a_nright| leq frac{1}{p m + q n} ). Find the general term of the sequence ( a_n ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the general term of a sequence ({a_n}). The sequence is defined with (a_1 = 1), and for any natural numbers (m) and (n), the condition (left|a_{m+n} - a_m - a_nright| leq frac{1}{p m + q n}) holds, where (p) and (q) are positive real numbers. Hmm, interesting.First, let me try to understand what this condition is saying. It's telling me that the difference between (a_{m+n}) and the sum (a_m + a_n) is bounded by (frac{1}{p m + q n}). So, as (m) and (n) get larger, the bound becomes smaller, which suggests that (a_{m+n}) is approximately equal to (a_m + a_n) for large (m) and (n). That makes me think that the sequence might be approximately linear, but with some small error term.If I consider the case where the inequality becomes an equality, that is, (left|a_{m+n} - a_m - a_nright| = frac{1}{p m + q n}), then maybe I can model the behavior of (a_n). But since it's an inequality, perhaps (a_n) is close to a linear function, but not exactly.Let me think about the functional equation aspect here. If the inequality were an equality without the absolute value, we'd have (a_{m+n} = a_m + a_n), which is Cauchy's functional equation. The solutions to that are linear functions, i.e., (a_n = k n) for some constant (k). But here, we have an inequality, so maybe (a_n) is approximately linear, with some small error term.Given that (a_1 = 1), if the sequence were exactly linear, we would have (a_n = n). But since we have this inequality, maybe (a_n) is close to (n), but with some correction term.Let me try to see what happens when I plug in specific values for (m) and (n). Let's start with (m = n = 1). Then, the condition becomes:[left|a_{2} - a_1 - a_1right| leq frac{1}{p cdot 1 + q cdot 1} = frac{1}{p + q}]So,[left|a_2 - 2right| leq frac{1}{p + q}]Which means (a_2) is in the interval (left[2 - frac{1}{p + q}, 2 + frac{1}{p + q}right]). Hmm, so (a_2) is approximately 2, but could be slightly less or more.Similarly, let's try (m = 2) and (n = 1):[left|a_{3} - a_2 - a_1right| leq frac{1}{p cdot 2 + q cdot 1} = frac{1}{2p + q}]So,[left|a_3 - a_2 - 1right| leq frac{1}{2p + q}]But since (a_2) is approximately 2, then (a_3) is approximately 3, with some small error.Wait, maybe I can use induction here. Suppose that for some (k), (a_k) is approximately (k), then for (a_{k+1}), we can write:[left|a_{k+1} - a_k - a_1right| leq frac{1}{p k + q cdot 1}]Which simplifies to:[left|a_{k+1} - a_k - 1right| leq frac{1}{p k + q}]If (a_k) is approximately (k), then (a_{k+1}) is approximately (k + 1), with an error term of (frac{1}{p k + q}). So, perhaps the error accumulates as we go along.Alternatively, maybe I can model (a_n) as (n + c_n), where (c_n) is some correction term that is small. Let me try that substitution.Let (a_n = n + c_n), so that (c_1 = a_1 - 1 = 0). Then, substituting into the condition:[left| (m + n + c_{m+n}) - (m + c_m) - (n + c_n) right| leq frac{1}{p m + q n}]Simplify the left side:[left| c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n right| leq frac{1}{p m + q n}]So, the condition becomes:[left| c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n right| leq frac{1}{p m + q n}]This is interesting. So, the correction term (c_n) satisfies a similar inequality but with a bound that decreases as (m) and (n) increase.Now, if I can find (c_n) such that this inequality holds, then I can express (a_n) as (n + c_n). Maybe (c_n) is a small term that diminishes as (n) increases.Alternatively, perhaps (c_n) is a convergent series or something like that. Let me think about how to approach this.Given that (c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n) is bounded by (frac{1}{p m + q n}), maybe I can consider the differences (c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n) and see if they form a telescoping series or something similar.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of subadditive or superadditive functions. But since the difference is bounded, it's a bit different.Wait, another approach: Maybe I can use the condition recursively. Let's try to express (a_n) in terms of (a_{n-1}) and (a_1). So, for (m = n-1) and (k = 1), we have:[left| a_n - a_{n-1} - a_1 right| leq frac{1}{p (n - 1) + q cdot 1}]Which simplifies to:[left| a_n - a_{n-1} - 1 right| leq frac{1}{p (n - 1) + q}]So, (a_n) is approximately (a_{n-1} + 1), with an error term (frac{1}{p(n - 1) + q}). This suggests that (a_n) is roughly (n), but with some small oscillations.If I consider the difference (a_n - n), let's denote this as (d_n = a_n - n). Then, the above inequality becomes:[left| d_n - d_{n-1} right| leq frac{1}{p(n - 1) + q}]So, the difference between consecutive (d_n) terms is bounded by (frac{1}{p(n - 1) + q}). This is a useful relation.If I can bound (d_n), perhaps I can show that (d_n) converges or is bounded, which would imply that (a_n) is approximately (n) with a bounded error.But wait, the problem asks for the general term of the sequence. So, maybe (a_n) is exactly (n) plus some term that can be expressed in terms of (p) and (q). Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps (a_n) is exactly (n). Let me test this.If (a_n = n), then (a_{m+n} = m + n), and (a_m + a_n = m + n), so the left side is zero, which is certainly less than (frac{1}{p m + q n}). So, (a_n = n) satisfies the condition. But is this the only solution?Wait, the problem says \\"Find the general term of the sequence (a_n)\\", implying that it's uniquely determined. So, maybe (a_n = n) is the only solution.But wait, let me check. Suppose (a_n = n + c), where (c) is a constant. Then, (a_{m+n} - a_m - a_n = (m + n + c) - (m + c) - (n + c) = -c). So, the absolute value is (| -c | = |c|). But the right side is (frac{1}{p m + q n}), which can be made arbitrarily small by choosing large (m) and (n). So, unless (c = 0), this would not satisfy the inequality for large (m) and (n). Therefore, (c) must be zero, so (a_n = n) is the only constant solution.But wait, maybe (c_n) is not a constant but a function that depends on (n). Earlier, I considered (a_n = n + c_n), leading to the condition on (c_n). So, perhaps (c_n) is a function that tends to zero as (n) increases, but is not necessarily zero.But the problem is to find the general term, so perhaps (a_n = n) is the only solution. Let me see.Wait, suppose (a_n = n + c_n), and (c_n) is such that (c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n) is bounded by (frac{1}{p m + q n}). If I can show that (c_n) must be zero, then (a_n = n) is the only solution.Alternatively, perhaps (c_n) is a convergent series, so that (c_n) approaches a limit as (n) approaches infinity. But given that (c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n) is bounded, maybe (c_n) must be linear, but with zero slope, so (c_n) is constant. But earlier, we saw that the constant must be zero.Wait, let me think again. Suppose (c_n) is a function such that (c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n) is bounded by (frac{1}{p m + q n}). If (c_n) is linear, say (c_n = k n), then (c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n = k(m + n) - k m - k n = 0), which satisfies the inequality. So, (c_n) could be linear. But then, (a_n = n + k n = (1 + k) n). But then, (a_1 = 1 + k = 1), so (k = 0). Therefore, (c_n = 0), so (a_n = n).Wait, that seems to suggest that (a_n = n) is the only solution. Let me check.Suppose (a_n = n + c_n), with (c_n) being any function. Then, the condition becomes:[|c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n| leq frac{1}{p m + q n}]If (c_n) is linear, as above, it must be zero. If (c_n) is non-linear, perhaps it's a convergent series. Let me consider whether such a function (c_n) can exist.Alternatively, maybe (c_n) is a telescoping series. Let me try to express (c_n) in terms of its differences.From the condition, for (m = n - 1) and (k = 1), we have:[|c_n - c_{n-1} - c_1| leq frac{1}{p (n - 1) + q}]But (c_1 = a_1 - 1 = 0), so:[|c_n - c_{n-1}| leq frac{1}{p (n - 1) + q}]This suggests that the difference (c_n - c_{n-1}) is bounded by (frac{1}{p(n - 1) + q}). Therefore, the sequence (c_n) is a series with terms bounded by (frac{1}{p(n - 1) + q}).If I sum these differences from (n = 2) to (n = N), I get:[c_N - c_1 = sum_{k=2}^{N} (c_k - c_{k-1}) leq sum_{k=2}^{N} frac{1}{p(k - 1) + q}]But (c_1 = 0), so:[c_N leq sum_{k=2}^{N} frac{1}{p(k - 1) + q}]Similarly, since the differences can be negative, we also have:[|c_N| leq sum_{k=2}^{N} frac{1}{p(k - 1) + q}]So, (c_N) is bounded by the sum of a series. Let me analyze this sum.The sum is:[sum_{k=2}^{N} frac{1}{p(k - 1) + q} = sum_{m=1}^{N-1} frac{1}{p m + q}]Where I substituted (m = k - 1). So, the sum becomes:[sum_{m=1}^{N-1} frac{1}{p m + q}]This is a harmonic-like series. The general term is (frac{1}{p m + q}), which behaves like (frac{1}{m}) for large (m). Therefore, the series diverges as (N) approaches infinity, because the harmonic series diverges.Wait, but that would imply that (c_N) is bounded by a divergent series, which would mean that (c_N) could grow without bound. But that contradicts the earlier assumption that (c_n) is a correction term that keeps (a_n) close to (n).Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the bound. The condition is (|c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n| leq frac{1}{p m + q n}), which is a bit different from the telescoping approach.Wait, maybe I should consider the behavior for large (n). Suppose (n) is large, and I set (m = n). Then, the condition becomes:[|a_{2n} - 2 a_n| leq frac{1}{p n + q n} = frac{1}{(p + q) n}]If (a_n = n + c_n), then:[|2n + c_{2n} - 2(n + c_n)| = |c_{2n} - 2 c_n| leq frac{1}{(p + q) n}]So, (|c_{2n} - 2 c_n| leq frac{1}{(p + q) n}). If (c_n) is small, this suggests that (c_{2n}) is approximately (2 c_n), but with a small error.If I iterate this, perhaps I can find an expression for (c_n). Let me try to see.Suppose (c_n) is of the order (frac{1}{n}). Let me assume (c_n = frac{k}{n}) for some constant (k). Then,[c_{2n} = frac{k}{2n}][2 c_n = frac{2k}{n}][c_{2n} - 2 c_n = frac{k}{2n} - frac{2k}{n} = -frac{3k}{2n}][|c_{2n} - 2 c_n| = frac{3k}{2n}]But according to the condition, this should be less than or equal to (frac{1}{(p + q) n}). So,[frac{3k}{2n} leq frac{1}{(p + q) n}][frac{3k}{2} leq frac{1}{p + q}][k leq frac{2}{3(p + q)}]So, if (c_n = frac{k}{n}) with (k leq frac{2}{3(p + q)}), then the condition is satisfied for (m = n). But this is just one case. I need to check if this assumption holds for other (m) and (n).Wait, maybe (c_n) is of the form (frac{k}{n}), and I can find (k) such that the condition holds for all (m) and (n). Let me try substituting (c_n = frac{k}{n}) into the general condition:[|c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n| leq frac{1}{p m + q n}]Substituting (c_n = frac{k}{n}):[left| frac{k}{m + n} - frac{k}{m} - frac{k}{n} right| leq frac{1}{p m + q n}]Simplify the left side:[left| k left( frac{1}{m + n} - frac{1}{m} - frac{1}{n} right) right| = |k| left| frac{1}{m + n} - frac{1}{m} - frac{1}{n} right|]Compute the expression inside the absolute value:[frac{1}{m + n} - frac{1}{m} - frac{1}{n} = frac{n - (m + n) - m}{m n (m + n)} = frac{-2 m - n}{m n (m + n)}]Wait, let me compute it step by step:[frac{1}{m + n} - frac{1}{m} - frac{1}{n} = frac{1}{m + n} - left( frac{1}{m} + frac{1}{n} right)][= frac{1}{m + n} - frac{m + n}{m n}][= frac{n m - (m + n)^2}{m n (m + n)}][= frac{n m - (m^2 + 2 m n + n^2)}{m n (m + n)}][= frac{-m^2 - m n - n^2}{m n (m + n)}][= -frac{m^2 + m n + n^2}{m n (m + n)}]Hmm, that seems complicated. Let me factor the numerator:[m^2 + m n + n^2 = (m + n)^2 - m n]So,[-frac{(m + n)^2 - m n}{m n (m + n)} = -frac{(m + n)^2}{m n (m + n)} + frac{m n}{m n (m + n)}][= -frac{m + n}{m n} + frac{1}{m + n}]Wait, that doesn't seem to help much. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, let's compute (frac{1}{m + n} - frac{1}{m} - frac{1}{n}) again:[frac{1}{m + n} - frac{1}{m} - frac{1}{n} = frac{1}{m + n} - left( frac{n + m}{m n} right)][= frac{1}{m + n} - frac{m + n}{m n}][= frac{m n - (m + n)^2}{m n (m + n)}][= frac{m n - (m^2 + 2 m n + n^2)}{m n (m + n)}][= frac{-m^2 - m n - n^2}{m n (m + n)}][= -frac{m^2 + m n + n^2}{m n (m + n)}]Yes, that's correct. So, the expression is negative, and its absolute value is:[frac{m^2 + m n + n^2}{m n (m + n)}]So, going back, the left side of the inequality is:[|k| cdot frac{m^2 + m n + n^2}{m n (m + n)}]And this must be less than or equal to (frac{1}{p m + q n}).So,[|k| cdot frac{m^2 + m n + n^2}{m n (m + n)} leq frac{1}{p m + q n}]Let me simplify the left side:[frac{m^2 + m n + n^2}{m n (m + n)} = frac{m^2 + m n + n^2}{m n (m + n)} = frac{m^2 + m n + n^2}{m n (m + n)}]Let me factor numerator and denominator:Wait, (m^2 + m n + n^2) is the numerator, and (m n (m + n)) is the denominator.I can write the numerator as (m^2 + m n + n^2 = (m + n)^2 - m n). So,[frac{(m + n)^2 - m n}{m n (m + n)} = frac{(m + n)^2}{m n (m + n)} - frac{m n}{m n (m + n)} = frac{m + n}{m n} - frac{1}{m + n}]So,[frac{m^2 + m n + n^2}{m n (m + n)} = frac{m + n}{m n} - frac{1}{m + n}]Therefore, the inequality becomes:[|k| left( frac{m + n}{m n} - frac{1}{m + n} right) leq frac{1}{p m + q n}]Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can find an upper bound for the left side.Note that (frac{m + n}{m n} = frac{1}{m} + frac{1}{n}), and (frac{1}{m + n} leq frac{1}{2 sqrt{m n}}) by AM ≥ GM.But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider specific cases where (m = n), to see what (k) must be.Let me set (m = n). Then, the inequality becomes:[|k| left( frac{2n}{n^2} - frac{1}{2n} right) leq frac{1}{(p + q) n}][|k| left( frac{2}{n} - frac{1}{2n} right) = |k| cdot frac{3}{2n} leq frac{1}{(p + q) n}][|k| cdot frac{3}{2} leq frac{1}{p + q}][|k| leq frac{2}{3(p + q)}]So, (k) must satisfy (|k| leq frac{2}{3(p + q)}). But earlier, when I assumed (c_n = frac{k}{n}), I found that (k leq frac{2}{3(p + q)}). So, this is consistent.But does this mean that (c_n = frac{k}{n}) with (k = frac{2}{3(p + q)}) satisfies the condition for all (m) and (n)? Let me check.Wait, let me plug (k = frac{2}{3(p + q)}) into the inequality:[|k| left( frac{m + n}{m n} - frac{1}{m + n} right) leq frac{1}{p m + q n}]So,[frac{2}{3(p + q)} left( frac{m + n}{m n} - frac{1}{m + n} right) leq frac{1}{p m + q n}]Is this true for all (m, n in mathbb{N})?Hmm, let's test with (m = 1), (n = 1):Left side:[frac{2}{3(p + q)} left( frac{2}{1} - frac{1}{2} right) = frac{2}{3(p + q)} cdot frac{3}{2} = frac{1}{p + q}]Right side:[frac{1}{p cdot 1 + q cdot 1} = frac{1}{p + q}]So, equality holds here.Now, let's try (m = 1), (n = 2):Left side:[frac{2}{3(p + q)} left( frac{3}{2} - frac{1}{3} right) = frac{2}{3(p + q)} cdot left( frac{9}{6} - frac{2}{6} right) = frac{2}{3(p + q)} cdot frac{7}{6} = frac{7}{9(p + q)}]Right side:[frac{1}{p cdot 1 + q cdot 2} = frac{1}{p + 2 q}]So, we need:[frac{7}{9(p + q)} leq frac{1}{p + 2 q}]Cross-multiplying:[7(p + 2 q) leq 9(p + q)][7 p + 14 q leq 9 p + 9 q][-2 p + 5 q leq 0][5 q leq 2 p][q leq frac{2}{5} p]Hmm, so this inequality only holds if (q leq frac{2}{5} p). But (p) and (q) are arbitrary positive real numbers, so this condition may not hold. Therefore, my assumption that (c_n = frac{k}{n}) with (k = frac{2}{3(p + q)}) leads to a violation of the inequality for some (m) and (n), unless (q leq frac{2}{5} p).This suggests that (c_n) cannot be of the form (frac{k}{n}) unless specific conditions on (p) and (q) are met, which are not given in the problem. Therefore, my initial assumption about the form of (c_n) might be incorrect.Perhaps I need a different approach. Let me consider the possibility that (a_n = n) is the only solution. Since when (a_n = n), the inequality is satisfied as equality (the left side is zero, which is less than or equal to the right side), and any deviation from (a_n = n) would introduce an error term that might not satisfy the inequality for all (m) and (n).Wait, earlier when I considered (a_n = n + c_n), I found that (c_n) must satisfy (|c_{m+n} - c_m - c_n| leq frac{1}{p m + q n}). If (c_n) is zero, this is satisfied. If (c_n) is non-zero, it's not clear if such a function exists without violating the inequality for some (m) and (n).Given that the problem asks for the general term, and considering that (a_n = n) satisfies the condition, and any other form might not, I think the only solution is (a_n = n).Therefore, the general term of the sequence is (a_n = n).**Final Answer**The general term of the sequence is (boxed{n})."},{"question":"A floor decoration is a circle with eight rays pointing from the center.

They're drawn tangent to each other, and their centers are all in a straight line. These circles are inscribed in a rectangle, which is then inscribed in another circle. I need to find the area of the largest circle, and the options are given as (A) 1000π, (B) 1700π, (C) 900π, (D) 1600π, and (E) 1300π.Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, let me visualize the setup. There are three circles, each with radius 10 cm, tangent to each other, and their centers are colinear. So, they must be arranged in a straight line, each touching the next one. Since they're tangent, the distance between the centers of any two adjacent circles should be equal to the sum of their radii. But since all three circles have the same radius, 10 cm, the distance between centers is 10 + 10 = 20 cm.So, if I imagine the three circles, each touching the next, the centers are spaced 20 cm apart. Therefore, the total length from the center of the first circle to the center of the last circle is 20 cm times 2, which is 40 cm. But wait, actually, since there are three circles, the distance between the first and the last center would be two intervals of 20 cm each, so 40 cm. That makes sense.Now, these three circles are inscribed in a rectangle. Hmm, inscribed in a rectangle. So, the rectangle must be such that all three circles fit perfectly inside it. Since the circles are tangent to each other and their centers are colinear, the rectangle must be arranged such that the circles are placed side by side along one side of the rectangle.Let me think about the dimensions of the rectangle. The circles are tangent to each other, so the length of the rectangle should be equal to the distance from the leftmost point of the first circle to the rightmost point of the last circle. Each circle has a radius of 10 cm, so the diameter is 20 cm. Since there are three circles, the total length would be 3 times the diameter? Wait, no. Wait, if the centers are 40 cm apart, then the total length from the first circle's leftmost point to the last circle's rightmost point would be 40 cm plus two radii, one on each end. So, 40 cm plus 10 cm plus 10 cm, which is 60 cm. So, the length of the rectangle is 60 cm.What about the width of the rectangle? Since the circles are all tangent to each other and their centers are colinear, the height of the rectangle must accommodate the diameter of the circles. Each circle has a diameter of 20 cm, so the width of the rectangle is 20 cm.So, the rectangle is 60 cm long and 20 cm wide. Now, this rectangle is inscribed in another circle. So, we have a rectangle inscribed in a circle, which means that the diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the larger circle.To find the area of the largest circle, I need to find its radius first. Since the diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the larger circle, I can calculate the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem. The rectangle has sides of 60 cm and 20 cm, so the diagonal d is sqrt(60² + 20²).Calculating that: 60 squared is 3600, and 20 squared is 400. Adding them together gives 3600 + 400 = 4000. So, the diagonal is sqrt(4000). Simplifying sqrt(4000), that's sqrt(400 * 10) = 20 * sqrt(10). So, the diagonal is 20√10 cm.Since the diagonal is the diameter of the larger circle, the radius R is half of that, so R = (20√10)/2 = 10√10 cm.Now, the area of the largest circle is πR². Plugging in R = 10√10, we get π*(10√10)². Let's compute that: (10√10)² is 100 * 10 = 1000. So, the area is 1000π.Wait, hold on. But 1000π is one of the options, option (A). But let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might make a mistake.First, the centers are colinear, each 20 cm apart. So, the centers are 40 cm apart from the first to the last. Then, the total length of the rectangle is 40 cm plus two radii, so 60 cm. The width is 20 cm, correct.Then, the diagonal is sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(3600 + 400) = sqrt(4000) = 20√10. So, diameter is 20√10, radius is 10√10. Area is π*(10√10)^2 = π*100*10 = 1000π. Hmm, that seems correct.But wait, the options include 1600π and 1700π, which are larger. Maybe I made a mistake in the dimensions of the rectangle.Let me think again. If the three circles are tangent to each other, with centers colinear, then the distance from the first center to the last center is 40 cm. The rectangle must enclose all three circles, so the length of the rectangle is the distance from the leftmost point of the first circle to the rightmost point of the last circle, which is 40 cm (distance between centers) plus 10 cm (radius of first circle) plus 10 cm (radius of last circle), totaling 60 cm. The width is the diameter of one circle, 20 cm. So, that seems right.Wait, but perhaps the rectangle is arranged differently? Maybe the circles are arranged vertically? But the problem says the centers are in a straight line, so it's either horizontal or vertical. But since the circles are inscribed in a rectangle, which is then inscribed in another circle, the rectangle must be such that both length and width are accommodated.Wait, if the circles are arranged vertically, the length of the rectangle would be 20 cm (diameter) and the height would be 60 cm. But in that case, the diagonal would still be sqrt(60² + 20²), same as before, so the area would still be 1000π. So, regardless of whether the rectangle is tall and narrow or short and wide, the diagonal remains the same.But wait, the problem says the circles are inscribed in a rectangle. So, does that mean the circles are inscribed in the rectangle, meaning that each circle touches all four sides? But that can't be because the circles are placed side by side. So, maybe the rectangle is just the minimal rectangle that can contain all three circles, which is 60 cm by 20 cm.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is such that each circle is tangent to the rectangle on all sides? But with three circles, that might not be possible unless they are arranged in a triangular formation, but the centers are colinear, so that's not the case.Wait, perhaps the rectangle is such that each circle is tangent to the top and bottom sides, but only the first and last circles are tangent to the left and right sides. That would make the rectangle's width equal to the diameter of the circles, 20 cm, and the length equal to the distance from the leftmost point of the first circle to the rightmost point of the last circle, which is 60 cm. So, that seems consistent.Therefore, the rectangle is 60 cm by 20 cm, diagonal is 20√10 cm, radius of the larger circle is 10√10 cm, area is 1000π. So, answer is (A).But wait, the options also include 1600π, which is 40²π, so maybe I made a mistake in the diagonal.Wait, let me recalculate the diagonal. 60 squared is 3600, 20 squared is 400, sum is 4000, square root is sqrt(4000). sqrt(4000) is sqrt(4*1000) is 2*sqrt(1000), which is 2*10*sqrt(10) = 20√10. So, that's correct. So, the radius is 10√10, area is 100π*10 = 1000π.But wait, maybe I misread the problem. It says \\"the circles are inscribed in a rectangle which is inscribed in another circle.\\" So, the rectangle is inscribed in the larger circle, meaning that all four corners of the rectangle touch the larger circle. So, the diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the larger circle.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is not 60 by 20, but arranged differently. Wait, if the three circles are arranged in a straight line, but maybe not all along the length. Maybe two circles are on the bottom and one is on top? But the centers are colinear, so they must be in a straight line.Wait, maybe the rectangle is such that the three circles are arranged vertically, but that would make the rectangle's height 60 cm and width 20 cm, same as before. So, the diagonal would still be sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(4000). So, same result.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is a square? But 60 and 20 are different, so it can't be a square.Wait, another thought: maybe the rectangle is arranged such that the three circles are placed side by side, but the rectangle is taller, such that each circle is touching the top and bottom of the rectangle. So, the width of the rectangle is 20 cm, as the diameter. The length is 60 cm, as the total length from leftmost to rightmost.So, that still gives the same diagonal.Wait, unless the rectangle is not 60 cm by 20 cm, but something else. Maybe I need to consider that the three circles are inscribed in the rectangle, meaning that each circle touches all four sides? But with three circles, that's not possible unless they are arranged in a specific way.Wait, perhaps the rectangle is such that each circle is tangent to the top and bottom, but only the first and last circles are tangent to the sides. So, the width is 20 cm, and the length is 60 cm. So, that is the minimal rectangle that can contain all three circles.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is such that all three circles are tangent to all four sides. But that would require the circles to be arranged in a way that they are all tangent to the top, bottom, left, and right sides, but with three circles, that's not straightforward.Wait, perhaps the rectangle is arranged such that the three circles are placed in a triangular formation, but the centers are colinear. Hmm, that seems conflicting because if centers are colinear, they can't form a triangle.Wait, maybe the rectangle is such that the three circles are placed in a straight line, each touching the rectangle on the top and bottom, but only the first and last circles touch the sides. So, the width is 20 cm, the length is 60 cm. So, same as before.So, I think my initial calculation is correct. The diagonal is sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(4000) = 20√10, so the radius is 10√10, area is 1000π.But wait, let me check the options again. The options are (A) 1000π, (B) 1700π, (C) 900π, (D) 1600π, (E) 1300π.So, 1000π is an option, but I have a feeling that maybe the problem is interpreted differently. Maybe the three circles are arranged such that each is tangent to the other two, forming a sort of triangle, but their centers are colinear? Wait, that can't happen because if their centers are colinear, they can't form a triangle.Wait, perhaps the three circles are arranged in a straight line, but each is tangent to the next, so the centers are colinear, each 20 cm apart. So, the total length is 40 cm between centers, but the rectangle would need to enclose all three circles, so from the leftmost point of the first circle to the rightmost point of the last circle is 60 cm, as I thought earlier.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is such that the three circles are placed side by side, each touching the rectangle on top and bottom, but the rectangle is taller. Wait, but each circle has a diameter of 20 cm, so the height can't be more than 20 cm if they are touching the top and bottom.Wait, perhaps the rectangle is such that the circles are placed vertically, so the height is 60 cm, and the width is 20 cm. Then, the diagonal is sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(4000), same as before.So, regardless of the orientation, the diagonal is the same, so the area of the largest circle is 1000π.But wait, let me think again. Maybe the three circles are arranged in a way that the rectangle is larger. For example, if the three circles are placed in a straight line, but the rectangle is such that each circle is tangent to the top and bottom, but the length is 60 cm, so the rectangle is 60 cm by 20 cm.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is such that the three circles are arranged in a way that the rectangle's length is 40 cm and width is 20 cm. Wait, no, because the centers are 40 cm apart, but the circles themselves extend beyond the centers by 10 cm on each side, so the total length is 60 cm.Wait, maybe the problem is that the three circles are each tangent to each other, but not necessarily all in a straight line. Wait, no, the problem says their centers are all in a straight line.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to draw it mentally. Three circles, each radius 10 cm, centers colinear, each tangent to the next. So, the first circle is at position 0, the second at 20 cm, the third at 40 cm. So, the total span from leftmost to rightmost is 0 - 10 cm to 40 + 10 cm, which is 50 cm? Wait, no, wait: the first circle's center is at 0, so its leftmost point is at -10 cm. The third circle's center is at 40 cm, so its rightmost point is at 50 cm. So, the total length is from -10 cm to 50 cm, which is 60 cm. So, the rectangle is 60 cm long and 20 cm wide.Therefore, the diagonal is sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(3600 + 400) = sqrt(4000) = 20√10 cm. So, the radius is 10√10, area is π*(10√10)^2 = 1000π.Therefore, the answer should be (A) 1000π.But wait, hold on. Let me check if the rectangle is indeed 60 cm by 20 cm. If the three circles are placed side by side, each with radius 10 cm, then the distance from the leftmost point of the first circle to the rightmost point of the last circle is 3 diameters, which is 3*20 = 60 cm. So, the length is 60 cm. The height is just the diameter of one circle, 20 cm, since they are all aligned horizontally. So, yes, the rectangle is 60 cm by 20 cm.Therefore, the diagonal is sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(4000) = 20√10 cm. So, the radius is half of that, which is 10√10 cm. The area is π*(10√10)^2 = π*100*10 = 1000π.So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is (A) 1000π.But wait, another thought: maybe the rectangle is such that the three circles are arranged vertically, so the height is 60 cm, and the width is 20 cm. Then, the diagonal is still sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(4000), same as before. So, same result.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is such that the three circles are arranged in a way that the rectangle is larger. For example, if the circles are arranged in a triangle, but the centers are colinear, which is impossible. So, no.Alternatively, maybe the three circles are arranged such that two are on the bottom and one is on top, but then the centers wouldn't be colinear. So, that's not the case.Therefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct. The area of the largest circle is 1000π, which is option (A).But wait, let me check the options again. Option (A) is 1000π, which is what I got. But I recall that sometimes in these problems, the rectangle might be interpreted differently, such as the three circles being inscribed in the rectangle in a way that they are all tangent to the sides. But with three circles, that's not straightforward.Wait, if the three circles are inscribed in the rectangle, does that mean each circle is tangent to all four sides? That would require the rectangle to have a width equal to the diameter of one circle, 20 cm, and a length equal to three times the diameter, 60 cm, which is the same as before. So, same rectangle.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is such that the three circles are arranged in a way that each is tangent to the top and bottom, but only the first and last are tangent to the sides. So, the width is 20 cm, and the length is 60 cm. So, same as before.Therefore, I think the answer is indeed (A) 1000π.But wait, the options also include 1600π, which is 40²π. Maybe I made a mistake in the diagonal calculation. Let me recalculate:sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(3600 + 400) = sqrt(4000). sqrt(4000) is equal to sqrt(4*1000) = 2*sqrt(1000). sqrt(1000) is approximately 31.62, so 2*31.62 is approximately 63.24 cm. So, the diameter is approximately 63.24 cm, radius is approximately 31.62 cm. Area is π*(31.62)^2 ≈ π*1000. So, that's consistent with 1000π.Wait, but 1000π is 1000*3.14 ≈ 3140 cm², while 1600π is 1600*3.14 ≈ 5024 cm², which is much larger. So, unless the rectangle is larger, the area can't be 1600π.Wait, maybe the rectangle is not 60 cm by 20 cm, but something else. Let me think again.If the three circles are arranged in a straight line, each tangent to the next, with centers colinear, then the distance between the centers is 20 cm each. So, centers at 0, 20, 40 cm. The leftmost point of the first circle is at -10 cm, and the rightmost point of the last circle is at 50 cm. So, the total length is 60 cm. The height is 20 cm, as the diameter.Therefore, the rectangle is 60 cm by 20 cm, diagonal sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(4000) = 20√10 cm. So, radius is 10√10 cm, area is 1000π.Wait, unless the rectangle is such that the circles are arranged in a way that the rectangle is larger. For example, if the three circles are arranged in a straight line, but the rectangle is such that the circles are not only tangent to each other but also tangent to the rectangle on all sides. But with three circles, that would require the rectangle to have a width of 20 cm and a length of 60 cm, as before.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is such that the circles are arranged in a way that the rectangle is a square. But 60 cm and 20 cm can't form a square.Wait, another thought: perhaps the three circles are arranged in a way that two are on the bottom and one is on top, but then the centers wouldn't be colinear. So, that's not the case.Alternatively, maybe the three circles are arranged in a way that they form a sort of triangle, but the centers are colinear, which is impossible because a triangle requires three non-colinear points.Therefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct. The area of the largest circle is 1000π, which is option (A).But wait, let me check the problem statement again: \\"Three circles, each with a radius of 10 cm, are drawn tangent to each other so that their centres are all in a straight line. These circles are inscribed in a rectangle which is inscribed in another circle.\\"So, the circles are inscribed in the rectangle, meaning that the rectangle is the smallest rectangle that can contain all three circles. So, the rectangle is 60 cm by 20 cm. Then, the rectangle is inscribed in another circle, meaning that the rectangle is inscribed in the larger circle, so the diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the larger circle.Therefore, the diagonal is sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(4000) = 20√10 cm. So, radius is 10√10 cm, area is π*(10√10)^2 = 1000π.Therefore, the answer is (A) 1000π.But wait, I just realized that 10√10 squared is 100*10=1000, so π*1000 is correct. So, yes, 1000π.But wait, another thought: maybe the rectangle is such that the three circles are arranged in a way that the rectangle is taller. For example, if the circles are arranged vertically, the height is 60 cm, and the width is 20 cm, same as before. So, the diagonal is still sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(4000). So, same result.Therefore, I think I'm confident that the area is 1000π, which is option (A).But wait, let me check the options again. The options are (A) 1000π, (B) 1700π, (C) 900π, (D) 1600π, (E) 1300π.So, 1000π is an option, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes problems like this might have a different interpretation.Wait, another approach: maybe the three circles are arranged such that each is tangent to the other two, forming a sort of triangle, but their centers are colinear. But that's impossible because if their centers are colinear, they can't form a triangle.Wait, perhaps the three circles are arranged in a straight line, but the rectangle is such that the circles are placed in a way that the rectangle's sides are tangent to all three circles. So, the rectangle's width is the diameter of one circle, 20 cm, and the length is the distance from the leftmost point of the first circle to the rightmost point of the last circle, which is 60 cm. So, same as before.Therefore, the diagonal is sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(4000) = 20√10 cm, radius is 10√10, area is 1000π.So, I think I've considered all possibilities, and the answer is (A) 1000π.But wait, another thought: maybe the three circles are arranged such that they are all tangent to each other and the rectangle, but not necessarily in a straight line. But the problem says their centers are all in a straight line, so they must be arranged in a straight line.Therefore, the rectangle is 60 cm by 20 cm, diagonal is 20√10 cm, radius is 10√10, area is 1000π.Yes, I think that's correct. So, the answer is (A) 1000π.But wait, hold on. Let me think about the rectangle inscribed in the circle. When a rectangle is inscribed in a circle, the circle's diameter is equal to the rectangle's diagonal. So, the diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the larger circle.But in this case, the rectangle is 60 cm by 20 cm, so the diagonal is sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(4000) = 20√10 cm. Therefore, the radius is 10√10 cm, and the area is π*(10√10)^2 = 1000π.Therefore, the answer is (A) 1000π.But wait, another thought: maybe the three circles are arranged in a way that the rectangle is larger. For example, if the three circles are arranged such that each is tangent to the top and bottom of the rectangle, but also tangent to the sides. But with three circles, that would require the rectangle to have a width of 20 cm and a length that can accommodate three circles, but each circle would have to be tangent to the sides, which is not possible unless they are arranged in a specific way.Wait, perhaps the three circles are arranged in a way that they are all tangent to the top and bottom of the rectangle, and the first and last circles are tangent to the sides. So, the width is 20 cm, and the length is 60 cm, same as before. So, same result.Therefore, I think I've confirmed it multiple times. The area is 1000π, which is option (A).But wait, just to be absolutely sure, let me calculate the diagonal again:60 cm length, 20 cm width.Diagonal = sqrt(60² + 20²) = sqrt(3600 + 400) = sqrt(4000) = 20√10 cm.Radius = 10√10 cm.Area = π*(10√10)^2 = π*100*10 = 1000π.Yes, that's correct.Therefore, the answer is (A) 1000π."},{"question":"Convert 89 to base-4.","answer":"To convert the decimal number 89 to base-4, I'll start by identifying the largest power of 4 that fits into 89. The powers of 4 are 1, 4, 16, 64, and 256. The largest power less than or equal to 89 is 64.Next, I'll determine how many times 64 fits into 89. Dividing 89 by 64 gives 1 with a remainder of 25. This means the coefficient for 64 is 1.Then, I'll move to the next lower power of 4, which is 16. Dividing the remainder 25 by 16 gives 1 with a remainder of 9. So, the coefficient for 16 is also 1.Continuing to the next power, 4, I'll divide the remainder 9 by 4. This gives 2 with a remainder of 1. Therefore, the coefficient for 4 is 2.Finally, the last power is 1. Dividing the remainder 1 by 1 gives 1 with no remainder.

The answer choices are from A to E, with numbers 6 to 10. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that in a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem holds: ( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ), where ( c ) is the hypotenuse. In this case, the hypotenuse is given as ( b + 1 ). So, substituting that in, the equation becomes:( a^2 + b^2 = (b + 1)^2 )Let me expand the right side:( a^2 + b^2 = b^2 + 2b + 1 )Hmm, okay. If I subtract ( b^2 ) from both sides, that simplifies things:( a^2 = 2b + 1 )So, ( a^2 = 2b + 1 ). That means that ( a^2 ) must be an odd number because ( 2b ) is even and adding 1 makes it odd. Therefore, ( a ) must also be odd since the square of an even number is even and the square of an odd number is odd.So, ( a ) is an odd integer. Let me express ( a ) as ( 2k + 1 ) where ( k ) is a non-negative integer. Then, substituting back into the equation:( (2k + 1)^2 = 2b + 1 )Expanding the left side:( 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2b + 1 )Subtracting 1 from both sides:( 4k^2 + 4k = 2b )Divide both sides by 2:( 2k^2 + 2k = b )So, ( b = 2k^2 + 2k ). That gives me ( b ) in terms of ( k ). Since ( b ) must be less than 100, I can write:( 2k^2 + 2k < 100 )Let me simplify this inequality:Divide both sides by 2:( k^2 + k < 50 )So, ( k^2 + k - 50 < 0 ). I need to find the values of ( k ) such that this inequality holds. Let me solve the quadratic equation ( k^2 + k - 50 = 0 ) to find the critical points.Using the quadratic formula:( k = frac{ -1 pm sqrt{1 + 200} }{2} = frac{ -1 pm sqrt{201} }{2} )Calculating ( sqrt{201} ) approximately: since ( 14^2 = 196 ) and ( 15^2 = 225 ), so ( sqrt{201} ) is approximately 14.177.So, ( k = frac{ -1 + 14.177 }{2} approx frac{13.177}{2} approx 6.588 )And the other root is negative, which we can ignore since ( k ) must be a non-negative integer.Therefore, ( k ) must be less than approximately 6.588. Since ( k ) is an integer, the maximum value ( k ) can take is 6.So, ( k ) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let me check each value of ( k ) to find the corresponding ( b ) and ensure that ( b < 100 ).Starting with ( k = 0 ):( b = 2(0)^2 + 2(0) = 0 ). Hmm, but ( b ) is a leg length, so it can't be zero. So, ( k = 0 ) is invalid.Next, ( k = 1 ):( b = 2(1)^2 + 2(1) = 2 + 2 = 4 ). That's valid since 4 < 100.( k = 2 ):( b = 2(4) + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 ). Still less than 100.( k = 3 ):( b = 2(9) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 ). Okay.( k = 4 ):( b = 2(16) + 8 = 32 + 8 = 40 ). Good.( k = 5 ):( b = 2(25) + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 ). Still under 100.( k = 6 ):( b = 2(36) + 12 = 72 + 12 = 84 ). 84 is less than 100.Wait, ( k = 7 ):Just to check, even though our earlier calculation said ( k ) should be less than ~6.588, let's compute ( b ) for ( k = 7 ):( b = 2(49) + 14 = 98 + 14 = 112 ). 112 is greater than 100, so that's invalid. So, ( k = 7 ) is too big.So, the valid values of ( k ) are 1 through 6, which gives us 6 values. But hold on, let me double-check because the answer choices go up to 10, and 6 is an option, but let me make sure I haven't missed anything.Wait, when ( k = 0 ), ( b = 0 ), which isn't valid because a triangle can't have a side of length 0. So, starting from ( k = 1 ) is correct.But let me also check if ( a ) is positive. Since ( a = 2k + 1 ), for ( k geq 0 ), ( a ) is at least 1, which is fine.So, for each ( k ) from 1 to 6, we get a valid ( b ). So, that's 6 triangles. But the answer choices include up to 10, and 6 is an option (A). But wait, let me think again.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the inequality. Let me check the inequality again.We had ( b = 2k^2 + 2k < 100 ). So, ( 2k^2 + 2k < 100 ). Dividing by 2: ( k^2 + k < 50 ). So, solving ( k^2 + k - 50 < 0 ). The roots are approximately at ( k approx 6.588 ) and ( k approx -7.588 ). So, the inequality holds for ( -7.588 < k < 6.588 ). Since ( k ) is a non-negative integer, ( k ) can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. But ( k = 0 ) gives ( b = 0 ), which is invalid. So, ( k = 1 ) to ( 6 ), which is 6 values. So, 6 triangles.But wait, the answer choices go up to 10, and 6 is an option, but I recall sometimes these problems can have more solutions if you consider different parametrizations or if I missed some cases.Wait, let me think differently. Maybe I can express the equation ( a^2 = 2b + 1 ) as ( a^2 - 1 = 2b ), so ( (a - 1)(a + 1) = 2b ). Since ( a ) is odd, both ( a - 1 ) and ( a + 1 ) are even numbers. Let me denote ( a - 1 = 2m ) and ( a + 1 = 2n ), where ( n = m + 1 ). So, substituting:( (2m)(2n) = 2b )Which simplifies to:( 4mn = 2b )Divide both sides by 2:( 2mn = b )So, ( b = 2mn ). Also, since ( n = m + 1 ), we can write ( b = 2m(m + 1) ). So, ( b = 2m^2 + 2m ). Wait, that's exactly the same expression I had earlier where ( b = 2k^2 + 2k ). So, ( m = k ). So, same result.Therefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers ( m ) such that ( b = 2m^2 + 2m < 100 ). Which, as before, gives ( m ) from 1 to 6.But wait, let me compute ( b ) for each ( m ) from 1 to 6:- ( m = 1 ): ( b = 2(1) + 2(1) = 4 )- ( m = 2 ): ( b = 8 + 4 = 12 )- ( m = 3 ): ( 18 + 6 = 24 )- ( m = 4 ): ( 32 + 8 = 40 )- ( m = 5 ): ( 50 + 10 = 60 )- ( m = 6 ): ( 72 + 12 = 84 )- ( m = 7 ): ( 98 + 14 = 112 ) which is over 100.So, only 6 values. So, 6 triangles. So, the answer should be 6, which is option A.Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Is there a possibility that ( a ) can be equal to ( b )? Because if ( a = b ), then the triangle would be isoceles right-angled, but in that case, the hypotenuse would be ( asqrt{2} ). But in our problem, the hypotenuse is ( b + 1 ), so unless ( asqrt{2} = b + 1 ), which would require ( a ) and ( b ) to satisfy that. But since ( a ) and ( b ) are integers, ( asqrt{2} ) is irrational, so ( a ) cannot equal ( b ). Therefore, ( a ) must be different from ( b ).But in our earlier calculations, ( a = 2k + 1 ), which is always odd, and ( b = 2k^2 + 2k ), which is even because it's 2 times something. So, ( a ) is odd, ( b ) is even, so they can't be equal. So, that case is already excluded.Wait, but another thought: is there a case where ( a ) is even? Because in the problem statement, it just says integer leg lengths ( a ) and ( b ). So, ( a ) could be even or odd, but in our earlier analysis, we found that ( a^2 = 2b + 1 ), which is odd, so ( a ) must be odd. So, ( a ) must be odd, so ( a ) cannot be even. Therefore, all solutions must have ( a ) odd and ( b ) even.So, that doesn't lead to any additional solutions.Wait, another approach: maybe I can list all possible ( b ) values less than 100 and see how many satisfy ( a^2 = 2b + 1 ) with ( a ) integer.So, ( a^2 = 2b + 1 ) implies ( b = frac{a^2 - 1}{2} ). So, ( a ) must be odd, as we saw, so let me set ( a = 2k + 1 ), which gives ( b = frac{(2k + 1)^2 - 1}{2} = frac{4k^2 + 4k + 1 - 1}{2} = frac{4k^2 + 4k}{2} = 2k^2 + 2k ). So, same as before.Therefore, ( b = 2k^2 + 2k ), which must be less than 100. So, solving ( 2k^2 + 2k < 100 ) as before.So, same result: ( k ) can be 1 to 6, giving 6 values. So, 6 triangles.But wait, the answer choices include up to 10, and 6 is an option, but I feel like maybe I missed something because sometimes when you have a problem like this, you can have more solutions if you consider different parametrizations or if the equation can be satisfied in more ways.Wait, let me think about the equation again: ( a^2 + b^2 = (b + 1)^2 ). So, expanding, ( a^2 = 2b + 1 ). So, ( a ) must be an odd integer, and ( b ) must be such that ( 2b + 1 ) is a perfect square.So, another way to think about it is: find all perfect squares ( a^2 ) such that ( a^2 - 1 ) is twice an integer ( b ), and ( b < 100 ).So, ( a^2 - 1 = 2b ), so ( a^2 ) must be an odd square greater than 1, and ( b = frac{a^2 - 1}{2} ) must be less than 100.So, let's find all odd integers ( a ) such that ( frac{a^2 - 1}{2} < 100 ).So, ( a^2 - 1 < 200 ), so ( a^2 < 201 ). Therefore, ( a < sqrt{201} approx 14.177 ). So, ( a ) can be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13.But ( a = 1 ): ( b = 0 ), invalid.( a = 3 ): ( b = (9 - 1)/2 = 4 )( a = 5 ): ( b = (25 - 1)/2 = 12 )( a = 7 ): ( b = (49 - 1)/2 = 24 )( a = 9 ): ( b = (81 - 1)/2 = 40 )( a = 11 ): ( b = (121 - 1)/2 = 60 )( a = 13 ): ( b = (169 - 1)/2 = 84 )( a = 15 ): ( b = (225 - 1)/2 = 112 ), which is over 100, so invalid.So, ( a ) can be 3,5,7,9,11,13, which gives 6 values of ( b ): 4,12,24,40,60,84. So, 6 triangles.Therefore, the answer is 6, which is option A.Wait, but hold on a second. The problem says \\"integer leg lengths ( a ) and ( b )\\", so ( a ) and ( b ) are both legs, and the hypotenuse is ( b + 1 ). So, in our solutions, ( a ) is the other leg, and ( b ) is one leg, and hypotenuse is ( b + 1 ).But let me just verify one of these solutions to make sure.Take ( a = 3 ), ( b = 4 ). Then hypotenuse should be ( 4 + 1 = 5 ). Checking Pythagorean theorem: ( 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2 ). Correct.Another one: ( a = 5 ), ( b = 12 ). Hypotenuse is 13. ( 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13^2 ). Correct.Similarly, ( a = 7 ), ( b = 24 ). Hypotenuse 25. ( 49 + 576 = 625 = 25^2 ). Correct.( a = 9 ), ( b = 40 ). Hypotenuse 41. ( 81 + 1600 = 1681 = 41^2 ). Correct.( a = 11 ), ( b = 60 ). Hypotenuse 61. ( 121 + 3600 = 3721 = 61^2 ). Correct.( a = 13 ), ( b = 84 ). Hypotenuse 85. ( 169 + 7056 = 7225 = 85^2 ). Correct.So, all these work. So, 6 triangles. So, answer is 6, which is option A.But wait, hold on, the answer choices are A)6, B)7, C)8, D)9, E)10.So, 6 is an option, but I just want to make sure I didn't miss any.Wait, let me check ( a = 1 ). ( a = 1 ), ( b = 0 ). But ( b = 0 ) is invalid because a triangle can't have a side of length 0. So, that's not a valid triangle.What about ( a = 15 )? ( b = 112 ), which is over 100, so invalid.So, only 6 solutions.Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\"integer leg lengths ( a ) and ( b )\\", so ( a ) and ( b ) are both legs, and hypotenuse is ( b + 1 ). So, in our solutions, ( a ) is the other leg, and ( b ) is one leg, hypotenuse is ( b + 1 ). So, is there a case where ( a ) is the longer leg? Because in our solutions, ( a ) is always less than ( b ), except when ( a = 3 ), ( b = 4 ), ( a ) is less than ( b ). Wait, no, ( a = 3 ), ( b = 4 ), hypotenuse 5. So, ( a ) is shorter than ( b ). Similarly, ( a = 5 ), ( b = 12 ), hypotenuse 13. So, ( a ) is shorter than ( b ).Wait, but what if ( a ) is longer than ( b )? Is that possible?Wait, let me think. If ( a ) is longer than ( b ), then ( a^2 + b^2 = (b + 1)^2 ). So, ( a^2 = 2b + 1 ). So, ( a ) must be greater than ( b ), but in our earlier solutions, ( a ) is less than ( b ). Wait, no, actually, let's check:For ( a = 3 ), ( b = 4 ): ( a < b )( a = 5 ), ( b = 12 ): ( a < b )( a = 7 ), ( b = 24 ): ( a < b )Wait, so in all these cases, ( a ) is less than ( b ). So, is there a case where ( a ) is greater than ( b )?Wait, let's suppose ( a > b ). Then, ( a^2 = 2b + 1 ). So, ( a^2 ) is greater than ( 2b ). But ( a > b ), so ( a^2 > b^2 ). But ( a^2 = 2b + 1 ), so ( 2b + 1 > b^2 ). So, ( b^2 - 2b - 1 < 0 ). Solving ( b^2 - 2b - 1 = 0 ), discriminant is ( 4 + 4 = 8 ), so roots at ( (2 pm sqrt{8})/2 = 1 pm sqrt{2} ). So, approximately, ( b < 1 + 1.414 approx 2.414 ). So, ( b ) must be less than 2.414. Since ( b ) is a positive integer, ( b = 1 ) or ( 2 ).Let me check ( b = 1 ):( a^2 = 2(1) + 1 = 3 ). Not a perfect square.( b = 2 ):( a^2 = 5 ). Not a perfect square.So, no solutions where ( a > b ). Therefore, all solutions must have ( a < b ). So, no additional solutions.Therefore, only 6 triangles.Wait, but hold on, in the problem statement, it says \\"integer leg lengths ( a ) and ( b )\\", so ( a ) and ( b ) are both legs, and hypotenuse is ( b + 1 ). So, is there a case where ( a = b )? As I thought earlier, no, because that would require ( asqrt{2} = b + 1 ), which isn't possible with integers.Therefore, all solutions have ( a < b ), and we've found 6 such triangles.So, the answer should be 6, which is option A.But wait, hold on, the answer choices are A)6, B)7, C)8, D)9, E)10. So, 6 is an option, but I just want to make sure I didn't miss any.Wait, let me think again about the equation ( a^2 = 2b + 1 ). So, ( a ) must be odd, and ( b = frac{a^2 - 1}{2} ). So, for each odd ( a ), compute ( b ), and check if ( b < 100 ).So, let's list all odd ( a ) such that ( b = frac{a^2 - 1}{2} < 100 ).Compute ( a ):Start with ( a = 1 ): ( b = 0 ) invalid.( a = 3 ): ( b = 4 )( a = 5 ): ( b = 12 )( a = 7 ): ( b = 24 )( a = 9 ): ( b = 40 )( a = 11 ): ( b = 60 )( a = 13 ): ( b = 84 )( a = 15 ): ( b = 112 ) which is over 100.So, only 6 values of ( a ) give ( b < 100 ). So, 6 triangles.Therefore, the answer is 6, which is option A.But wait, the problem says \\"integer leg lengths ( a ) and ( b )\\", so ( a ) and ( b ) are both legs, and hypotenuse is ( b + 1 ). So, in our solutions, ( a ) is the other leg, and ( b ) is one leg, hypotenuse is ( b + 1 ). So, is there a case where ( a ) is the longer leg? As I thought earlier, no, because ( a ) must be less than ( b ) in all solutions.Wait, let me think about whether ( a ) can be greater than ( b ). If ( a > b ), then ( a^2 = 2b + 1 ). So, ( a^2 > 2b ). But since ( a > b ), ( a^2 > b^2 ). So, ( 2b + 1 > b^2 ). So, ( b^2 - 2b - 1 < 0 ). As before, this gives ( b < 1 + sqrt{2} approx 2.414 ). So, ( b = 1 ) or ( 2 ). But as above, ( b = 1 ) gives ( a^2 = 3 ), not integer. ( b = 2 ) gives ( a^2 = 5 ), not integer. So, no solutions where ( a > b ).Therefore, all solutions must have ( a < b ), and we've found 6 such triangles.So, the answer is 6, which is option A.Wait, but hold on, let me check the problem statement again: \\"How many right triangles have integer leg lengths ( a ) and ( b ) and a hypotenuse of length ( b + 1 ), where ( b < 100 )?\\" So, it's asking for the number of triangles, not the number of ( a ) or ( b ). So, each pair ( (a, b) ) corresponds to a unique triangle. So, since we have 6 such pairs, the answer is 6.Therefore, the answer is 6, which is option A.But wait, just to make sure, let me list all the pairs:1. ( a = 3 ), ( b = 4 ), hypotenuse 52. ( a = 5 ), ( b = 12 ), hypotenuse 133. ( a = 7 ), ( b = 24 ), hypotenuse 254. ( a = 9 ), ( b = 40 ), hypotenuse 415. ( a = 11 ), ( b = 60 ), hypotenuse 616. ( a = 13 ), ( b = 84 ), hypotenuse 85So, 6 triangles. So, 6 is the correct answer.Therefore, I think the answer is A)6.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"If a=log_8 225 and b=log_2 15, thentext{(A) } a=b/2quad text{(B) } a=2b/3quad text{(C) } a=bquad text{(D) } b=a/2quad text{(E) } a=3b/2","answer":"First, I recognize that both ( a ) and ( b ) are logarithms with base 2.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. Since the question is asking for the smallest prime that divides the expression for some integer (n), I should probably check these primes in order, starting from the smallest.So, let me start with 2. I need to see if there exists an integer (n) such that (n^2 + 5n + 23) is divisible by 2. In other words, (n^2 + 5n + 23 equiv 0 mod 2). Let me simplify this expression modulo 2.Calculating each term modulo 2:- (n^2 mod 2): Squaring any integer modulo 2. If (n) is even, (n = 2k), so (n^2 = 4k^2 equiv 0 mod 2). If (n) is odd, (n = 2k + 1), so (n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 equiv 1 mod 2). So, (n^2 mod 2) is 0 if (n) is even, and 1 if (n) is odd.- (5n mod 2): 5 is odd, so multiplying by (n). If (n) is even, (5n) is even, so (5n equiv 0 mod 2). If (n) is odd, (5n) is odd, so (5n equiv 1 mod 2).- 23 mod 2: 23 is odd, so 23 ≡ 1 mod 2.Putting it all together:If (n) is even:(n^2 + 5n + 23 equiv 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 mod 2). So, it's 1 mod 2, which is not 0.If (n) is odd:(n^2 + 5n + 23 equiv 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 mod 2). 3 mod 2 is 1, so again, it's 1 mod 2, not 0.So, regardless of whether (n) is even or odd, (n^2 + 5n + 23) is always odd. That means it's never divisible by 2. So, 2 is out.Next prime is 3. Let's check if 3 divides the expression for some (n). So, we need (n^2 + 5n + 23 equiv 0 mod 3).Let me compute each term modulo 3.First, (n^2 mod 3). The possible residues of (n) modulo 3 are 0, 1, 2.- If (n equiv 0 mod 3), then (n^2 equiv 0 mod 3).- If (n equiv 1 mod 3), then (n^2 equiv 1 mod 3).- If (n equiv 2 mod 3), then (n^2 equiv 4 equiv 1 mod 3).So, (n^2) is either 0 or 1 mod 3.Next, (5n mod 3). 5 mod 3 is 2, so (5n equiv 2n mod 3).- If (n equiv 0 mod 3), then (2n equiv 0 mod 3).- If (n equiv 1 mod 3), then (2n equiv 2 mod 3).- If (n equiv 2 mod 3), then (2n equiv 4 equiv 1 mod 3).Lastly, 23 mod 3. 23 divided by 3 is 7 with a remainder of 2, so 23 ≡ 2 mod 3.Putting it all together:Case 1: (n equiv 0 mod 3)- (n^2 equiv 0)- (5n equiv 0)- 23 ≡ 2Total: 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 mod 3 ≠ 0Case 2: (n equiv 1 mod 3)- (n^2 equiv 1)- (5n equiv 2)- 23 ≡ 2Total: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 ≡ 2 mod 3 ≠ 0Case 3: (n equiv 2 mod 3)- (n^2 equiv 1)- (5n equiv 1)- 23 ≡ 2Total: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3 ≠ 0So, in none of the cases does (n^2 + 5n + 23) ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, 3 is also not a divisor for any integer (n).Moving on to the next prime, which is 5. Let's check if 5 divides (n^2 + 5n + 23) for some (n).So, (n^2 + 5n + 23 equiv 0 mod 5).Simplify each term modulo 5:- (n^2 mod 5): The possible residues of (n) modulo 5 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.  - 0² = 0  - 1² = 1  - 2² = 4  - 3² = 9 ≡ 4 mod 5  - 4² = 16 ≡ 1 mod 5- (5n mod 5): 5n is always 0 mod 5.- 23 mod 5: 23 divided by 5 is 4 with remainder 3, so 23 ≡ 3 mod 5.So, the expression simplifies to (n^2 + 0 + 3 equiv n^2 + 3 mod 5).We need (n^2 + 3 equiv 0 mod 5), which means (n^2 equiv -3 equiv 2 mod 5).Looking at the possible (n^2) values mod 5: 0, 1, 4. So, does 2 ever occur? From above, the squares mod 5 are 0,1,4. So, 2 is not among them. Therefore, (n^2) can never be 2 mod 5, meaning the equation (n^2 + 3 equiv 0 mod 5) has no solution. So, 5 is also out.Next prime is 7. Let's check if 7 divides the expression for some (n).So, (n^2 + 5n + 23 equiv 0 mod 7).Compute each term modulo 7.First, (n^2 mod 7). The possible residues for (n) mod 7 are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.Squares modulo 7:- 0² = 0- 1² = 1- 2² = 4- 3² = 9 ≡ 2- 4² = 16 ≡ 2- 5² = 25 ≡ 4- 6² = 36 ≡ 1So, possible (n^2) mod 7: 0,1,2,4.Next, (5n mod 7). 5 is equivalent to 5 mod 7, so:- If (n equiv 0), 5n ≡ 0- If (n equiv 1), 5n ≡ 5- If (n equiv 2), 5n ≡ 10 ≡ 3- If (n equiv 3), 5n ≡ 15 ≡ 1- If (n equiv 4), 5n ≡ 20 ≡ 6- If (n equiv 5), 5n ≡ 25 ≡ 4- If (n equiv 6), 5n ≡ 30 ≡ 2Lastly, 23 mod 7: 23 divided by 7 is 3 with remainder 2, so 23 ≡ 2 mod 7.Putting it all together, the expression is (n^2 + 5n + 2 mod 7). We need this to be 0 mod 7.So, let's go through each possible residue of (n) mod 7 and compute (n^2 + 5n + 2) mod 7.Case 1: (n equiv 0 mod 7)- (n^2 = 0)- (5n = 0)- 23 ≡ 2Total: 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 mod 7 ≠ 0Case 2: (n equiv 1 mod 7)- (n^2 = 1)- (5n = 5)- 23 ≡ 2Total: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7 ≠ 0Case 3: (n equiv 2 mod 7)- (n^2 = 4)- (5n = 3)- 23 ≡ 2Total: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 ≡ 2 mod 7 ≠ 0Case 4: (n equiv 3 mod 7)- (n^2 = 2)- (5n = 1)- 23 ≡ 2Total: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 mod 7 ≠ 0Case 5: (n equiv 4 mod 7)- (n^2 = 2)- (5n = 6)- 23 ≡ 2Total: 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 ≡ 3 mod 7 ≠ 0Case 6: (n equiv 5 mod 7)- (n^2 = 4)- (5n = 4)- 23 ≡ 2Total: 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 ≡ 3 mod 7 ≠ 0Case 7: (n equiv 6 mod 7)- (n^2 = 1)- (5n = 2)- 23 ≡ 2Total: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 mod 7 ≠ 0So, in none of the cases does the expression equal 0 mod 7. Therefore, 7 is also not a divisor for any integer (n).Moving on to the next prime, which is 11. Let me check if 11 divides (n^2 + 5n + 23) for some (n).So, (n^2 + 5n + 23 equiv 0 mod 11).Simplify each term modulo 11.First, (n^2 mod 11). The possible residues for (n) mod 11 are 0 through 10. The squares mod 11 are:- 0² = 0- 1² = 1- 2² = 4- 3² = 9- 4² = 16 ≡ 5- 5² = 25 ≡ 3- 6² = 36 ≡ 3- 7² = 49 ≡ 5- 8² = 64 ≡ 9- 9² = 81 ≡ 4- 10² = 100 ≡ 1So, possible (n^2) mod 11: 0,1,3,4,5,9.Next, (5n mod 11). 5 is equivalent to 5 mod 11, so:- (n) from 0 to 10:  - 0: 0  - 1: 5  - 2: 10  - 3: 15 ≡ 4  - 4: 20 ≡ 9  - 5: 25 ≡ 3  - 6: 30 ≡ 8  - 7: 35 ≡ 2  - 8: 40 ≡ 7  - 9: 45 ≡ 1  - 10: 50 ≡ 6Lastly, 23 mod 11: 23 - 2*11 = 1, so 23 ≡ 1 mod 11.Putting it all together, the expression is (n^2 + 5n + 1 mod 11). We need this to be 0 mod 11.So, let's go through each possible residue of (n) mod 11 and compute (n^2 + 5n + 1) mod 11.Case 1: (n equiv 0 mod 11)- (n^2 = 0)- (5n = 0)- 23 ≡ 1Total: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 mod 11 ≠ 0Case 2: (n equiv 1 mod 11)- (n^2 = 1)- (5n = 5)- 23 ≡ 1Total: 1 + 5 + 1 = 7 mod 11 ≠ 0Case 3: (n equiv 2 mod 11)- (n^2 = 4)- (5n = 10)- 23 ≡ 1Total: 4 + 10 + 1 = 15 ≡ 4 mod 11 ≠ 0Case 4: (n equiv 3 mod 11)- (n^2 = 9)- (5n = 4)- 23 ≡ 1Total: 9 + 4 + 1 = 14 ≡ 3 mod 11 ≠ 0Case 5: (n equiv 4 mod 11)- (n^2 = 5)- (5n = 9)- 23 ≡ 1Total: 5 + 9 + 1 = 15 ≡ 4 mod 11 ≠ 0Case 6: (n equiv 5 mod 11)- (n^2 = 3)- (5n = 3)- 23 ≡ 1Total: 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 mod 11 ≠ 0Case 7: (n equiv 6 mod 11)- (n^2 = 3)- (5n = 8)- 23 ≡ 1Total: 3 + 8 + 1 = 12 ≡ 1 mod 11 ≠ 0Case 8: (n equiv 7 mod 11)- (n^2 = 5)- (5n = 2)- 23 ≡ 1Total: 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 mod 11 ≠ 0Case 9: (n equiv 8 mod 11)- (n^2 = 9)- (5n = 7)- 23 ≡ 1Total: 9 + 7 + 1 = 17 ≡ 6 mod 11 ≠ 0Case 10: (n equiv 9 mod 11)- (n^2 = 4)- (5n = 1)- 23 ≡ 1Total: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 mod 11 ≠ 0Case 11: (n equiv 10 mod 11)- (n^2 = 1)- (5n = 6)- 23 ≡ 1Total: 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 mod 11 ≠ 0Hmm, none of these cases result in 0 mod 11. So, 11 is also not a divisor for any integer (n).Next prime is 13. Let me check if 13 divides the expression for some (n).So, (n^2 + 5n + 23 equiv 0 mod 13).Simplify each term modulo 13.First, (n^2 mod 13). The possible residues for (n) mod 13 are 0 through 12. The squares mod 13 are:- 0² = 0- 1² = 1- 2² = 4- 3² = 9- 4² = 16 ≡ 3- 5² = 25 ≡ 12- 6² = 36 ≡ 10- 7² = 49 ≡ 10- 8² = 64 ≡ 12- 9² = 81 ≡ 3- 10² = 100 ≡ 9- 11² = 121 ≡ 4- 12² = 144 ≡ 1So, possible (n^2) mod 13: 0,1,3,4,9,10,12.Next, (5n mod 13). 5 is equivalent to 5 mod 13, so:- (n) from 0 to 12:  - 0: 0  - 1: 5  - 2: 10  - 3: 15 ≡ 2  - 4: 20 ≡ 7  - 5: 25 ≡ 12  - 6: 30 ≡ 4  - 7: 35 ≡ 9  - 8: 40 ≡ 1  - 9: 45 ≡ 6  - 10: 50 ≡ 11  - 11: 55 ≡ 3  - 12: 60 ≡ 8Lastly, 23 mod 13: 23 - 13 = 10, so 23 ≡ 10 mod 13.Putting it all together, the expression is (n^2 + 5n + 10 mod 13). We need this to be 0 mod 13.So, let's go through each possible residue of (n) mod 13 and compute (n^2 + 5n + 10) mod 13.Case 1: (n equiv 0 mod 13)- (n^2 = 0)- (5n = 0)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 0 + 0 + 10 = 10 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 2: (n equiv 1 mod 13)- (n^2 = 1)- (5n = 5)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 1 + 5 + 10 = 16 ≡ 3 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 3: (n equiv 2 mod 13)- (n^2 = 4)- (5n = 10)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 4 + 10 + 10 = 24 ≡ 11 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 4: (n equiv 3 mod 13)- (n^2 = 9)- (5n = 2)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 9 + 2 + 10 = 21 ≡ 8 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 5: (n equiv 4 mod 13)- (n^2 = 3)- (5n = 7)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 3 + 7 + 10 = 20 ≡ 7 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 6: (n equiv 5 mod 13)- (n^2 = 12)- (5n = 12)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 12 + 12 + 10 = 34 ≡ 8 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 7: (n equiv 6 mod 13)- (n^2 = 10)- (5n = 4)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 10 + 4 + 10 = 24 ≡ 11 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 8: (n equiv 7 mod 13)- (n^2 = 10)- (5n = 9)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 10 + 9 + 10 = 29 ≡ 3 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 9: (n equiv 8 mod 13)- (n^2 = 12)- (5n = 1)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 12 + 1 + 10 = 23 ≡ 10 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 10: (n equiv 9 mod 13)- (n^2 = 3)- (5n = 6)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 3 + 6 + 10 = 19 ≡ 6 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 11: (n equiv 10 mod 13)- (n^2 = 9)- (5n = 11)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 9 + 11 + 10 = 30 ≡ 4 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 12: (n equiv 11 mod 13)- (n^2 = 4)- (5n = 3)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 4 + 3 + 10 = 17 ≡ 4 mod 13 ≠ 0Case 13: (n equiv 12 mod 13)- (n^2 = 1)- (5n = 8)- 23 ≡ 10Total: 1 + 8 + 10 = 19 ≡ 6 mod 13 ≠ 0So, again, none of the cases result in 0 mod 13. Therefore, 13 is also not a divisor for any integer (n).Next prime is 17. Let me check if 17 divides the expression for some (n).So, (n^2 + 5n + 23 equiv 0 mod 17).Simplify each term modulo 17.First, (n^2 mod 17). The possible residues for (n) mod 17 are 0 through 16. The squares mod 17 are:- 0² = 0- 1² = 1- 2² = 4- 3² = 9- 4² = 16- 5² = 25 ≡ 8- 6² = 36 ≡ 2- 7² = 49 ≡ 15- 8² = 64 ≡ 13- 9² = 81 ≡ 13- 10² = 100 ≡ 15- 11² = 121 ≡ 2- 12² = 144 ≡ 8- 13² = 169 ≡ 16- 14² = 196 ≡ 9- 15² = 225 ≡ 4- 16² = 256 ≡ 1So, possible (n^2) mod 17: 0,1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16.Next, (5n mod 17). 5 is equivalent to 5 mod 17, so:- (n) from 0 to 16:  - 0: 0  - 1: 5  - 2: 10  - 3: 15  - 4: 20 ≡ 3  - 5: 25 ≡ 8  - 6: 30 ≡ 13  - 7: 35 ≡ 1  - 8: 40 ≡ 6  - 9: 45 ≡ 11  - 10: 50 ≡ 16  - 11: 55 ≡ 4  - 12: 60 ≡ 9  - 13: 65 ≡ 14  - 14: 70 ≡ 2  - 15: 75 ≡ 7  - 16: 80 ≡ 12Lastly, 23 mod 17: 23 - 17 = 6, so 23 ≡ 6 mod 17.Putting it all together, the expression is (n^2 + 5n + 6 mod 17). We need this to be 0 mod 17.So, let's go through each possible residue of (n) mod 17 and compute (n^2 + 5n + 6) mod 17.Case 1: (n equiv 0 mod 17)- (n^2 = 0)- (5n = 0)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 0 + 0 + 6 = 6 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 2: (n equiv 1 mod 17)- (n^2 = 1)- (5n = 5)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 1 + 5 + 6 = 12 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 3: (n equiv 2 mod 17)- (n^2 = 4)- (5n = 10)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 4 + 10 + 6 = 20 ≡ 3 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 4: (n equiv 3 mod 17)- (n^2 = 9)- (5n = 15)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 9 + 15 + 6 = 30 ≡ 13 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 5: (n equiv 4 mod 17)- (n^2 = 16)- (5n = 3)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 16 + 3 + 6 = 25 ≡ 8 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 6: (n equiv 5 mod 17)- (n^2 = 8)- (5n = 8)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 8 + 8 + 6 = 22 ≡ 5 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 7: (n equiv 6 mod 17)- (n^2 = 2)- (5n = 13)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 2 + 13 + 6 = 21 ≡ 4 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 8: (n equiv 7 mod 17)- (n^2 = 15)- (5n = 1)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 15 + 1 + 6 = 22 ≡ 5 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 9: (n equiv 8 mod 17)- (n^2 = 13)- (5n = 6)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 13 + 6 + 6 = 25 ≡ 8 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 10: (n equiv 9 mod 17)- (n^2 = 13)- (5n = 11)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 13 + 11 + 6 = 30 ≡ 13 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 11: (n equiv 10 mod 17)- (n^2 = 15)- (5n = 16)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 15 + 16 + 6 = 37 ≡ 3 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 12: (n equiv 11 mod 17)- (n^2 = 2)- (5n = 4)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 13: (n equiv 12 mod 17)- (n^2 = 8)- (5n = 9)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 8 + 9 + 6 = 23 ≡ 6 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 14: (n equiv 13 mod 17)- (n^2 = 16)- (5n = 14)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 16 + 14 + 6 = 36 ≡ 2 mod 17 ≠ 0Case 15: (n equiv 14 mod 17)- (n^2 = 9)- (5n = 2)- 23 ≡ 6Total: 9 + 2 + 6 = 17 ≡ 0 mod 17Wait, hold on! In case 15, when (n equiv 14 mod 17), the total is 17, which is 0 mod 17. So, that means when (n = 14), (n^2 + 5n + 23) is divisible by 17.Therefore, 17 is a prime that divides the expression for some integer (n). Since we've checked all smaller primes (2,3,5,7,11,13) and none of them work, 17 must be the smallest such prime.But just to be thorough, let me verify this by plugging (n = 14) into the expression:(14^2 + 5*14 + 23 = 196 + 70 + 23 = 289).289 divided by 17: 17*17 = 289. So yes, 289 is indeed divisible by 17, and 17 is prime.Therefore, the smallest positive prime number that divides (n^2 + 5n + 23) for some integer (n) is 17.**Final Answer**The smallest positive prime number is boxed{17}."},{"question":"Cassidy collects movie posters from newly released sci-fi movies.

Since negative integers decrease as their absolute values increase, the largest negative integer is -1.Next, I'll determine the possible values of ( b ) given that ( |b| = 6 ). The absolute value of 6 means ( b ) can be either 6 or -6.Then, I'll consider the value of ( c ), which is equal to its opposite. This implies that ( c = 0 ) because 0 is the only number that is equal to its opposite.Finally, I'll calculate ( a + b + c ) by substituting the identified values. If ( b = 6 ), the sum is ( -1 + 6 + 0 = 5 ). If ( b = -6 ), the sum is ( -1 + (-6) + 0 = -7 )."},{"question":"Suppose that point ( D ) lies on side ( BC ) of triangle ( ABC ) such that ( AD ) bisects ( angle BAC ), and let (ell) denote the line through ( A ) perpendicular to ( AD ). If the distances from ( B ) and ( C ) to (ell) are 5 and 6, respectively, compute ( AD ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. We have triangle ( ABC ), and point ( D ) is on side ( BC ). The line ( AD ) bisects angle ( BAC ). So, ( AD ) is the angle bisector. Then, there's a line ( ell ) passing through point ( A ) and is perpendicular to ( AD ). The problem states that the distances from points ( B ) and ( C ) to this line ( ell ) are 5 and 6, respectively. We need to find the length of ( AD ).Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. Triangle ( ABC ), with ( AD ) as the angle bisector. So, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio of ( AB ) to ( AC ) is equal to the ratio of ( BD ) to ( DC ). That might come in handy later.Now, the line ( ell ) is through ( A ) and perpendicular to ( AD ). So, ( ell ) is like a line that starts at ( A ) and goes off in a direction perpendicular to ( AD ). The distances from ( B ) and ( C ) to ( ell ) are given as 5 and 6. So, if I imagine dropping perpendiculars from ( B ) and ( C ) onto ( ell ), the lengths of these perpendiculars are 5 and 6 units, respectively.I think I need to find a way to relate these distances to the length of ( AD ). Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me set up a coordinate system.Let me place point ( A ) at the origin ( (0, 0) ). Since ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), and ( ell ) passes through ( A ), I can align ( AD ) along one of the coordinate axes to simplify calculations. Let me choose the x-axis for ( AD ). So, point ( D ) lies somewhere along the x-axis, say at ( (d, 0) ). Then, line ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), which is along the x-axis, so ( ell ) must be the y-axis. Wait, but ( ell ) passes through ( A ), which is at ( (0, 0) ), so if ( AD ) is along the x-axis, then ( ell ) is the y-axis.But hold on, if ( ell ) is the y-axis, then the distance from any point to ( ell ) is just the absolute value of its x-coordinate. So, the distance from ( B ) to ( ell ) is 5, which would mean that the x-coordinate of ( B ) is 5 or -5. Similarly, the distance from ( C ) to ( ell ) is 6, so the x-coordinate of ( C ) is 6 or -6.But wait, in triangle ( ABC ), points ( B ) and ( C ) must be on the same side of ( ell ) or opposite sides? Hmm, since ( AD ) is an angle bisector, and ( D ) is on ( BC ), points ( B ) and ( C ) must be on opposite sides of ( AD ). But ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), so if ( AD ) is along the x-axis, then ( ell ) is the y-axis. So, points ( B ) and ( C ) would have x-coordinates 5 and 6 or -5 and -6. But since ( D ) is on ( BC ), which is between ( B ) and ( C ), their x-coordinates must be on opposite sides of ( D ). Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully.Alternatively, maybe I should assign coordinates differently. Let me try to set ( AD ) along the x-axis, with ( A ) at ( (0, 0) ) and ( D ) at ( (d, 0) ). Then, line ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), so it's the line ( x = 0 ), which is the y-axis. Then, points ( B ) and ( C ) lie somewhere in the plane, and their distances to ( ell ) (the y-axis) are 5 and 6, respectively. So, the x-coordinates of ( B ) and ( C ) are 5 and 6 or -5 and -6.But since ( D ) is on ( BC ), the line ( BC ) must pass through ( (d, 0) ). So, if ( B ) is at ( (5, b) ) and ( C ) is at ( (6, c) ), then the line ( BC ) must pass through ( (d, 0) ). Alternatively, if ( B ) is at ( (-5, b) ) and ( C ) is at ( (-6, c) ), then the line ( BC ) would pass through ( (d, 0) ).Wait, but if ( AD ) is the angle bisector, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, ( frac{AB}{AC} = frac{BD}{DC} ). So, if I can express ( AB ) and ( AC ) in terms of coordinates, I can use that ratio.Let me try to assign coordinates accordingly. Let me place ( A ) at ( (0, 0) ), ( D ) at ( (d, 0) ), ( B ) at ( (5, b) ), and ( C ) at ( (6, c) ). Then, the line ( BC ) passes through ( (d, 0) ). So, the equation of line ( BC ) can be found using points ( B(5, b) ) and ( C(6, c) ).The slope of ( BC ) is ( m = frac{c - b}{6 - 5} = c - b ). So, the equation is ( y - b = (c - b)(x - 5) ). Since this line passes through ( (d, 0) ), plugging in, we get:( 0 - b = (c - b)(d - 5) )So, ( -b = (c - b)(d - 5) )Let me write that as:( (c - b)(d - 5) = -b )  --- Equation (1)Now, since ( AD ) is the angle bisector, by the Angle Bisector Theorem:( frac{AB}{AC} = frac{BD}{DC} )Compute ( AB ) and ( AC ):( AB = sqrt{(5 - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2} = sqrt{25 + b^2} )( AC = sqrt{(6 - 0)^2 + (c - 0)^2} = sqrt{36 + c^2} )Compute ( BD ) and ( DC ):Point ( D ) is at ( (d, 0) ), so ( BD ) is the distance from ( B(5, b) ) to ( D(d, 0) ):( BD = sqrt{(d - 5)^2 + (0 - b)^2} = sqrt{(d - 5)^2 + b^2} )Similarly, ( DC = sqrt{(6 - d)^2 + (c - 0)^2} = sqrt{(6 - d)^2 + c^2} )So, by the Angle Bisector Theorem:( frac{sqrt{25 + b^2}}{sqrt{36 + c^2}} = frac{sqrt{(d - 5)^2 + b^2}}{sqrt{(6 - d)^2 + c^2}} )Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:( frac{25 + b^2}{36 + c^2} = frac{(d - 5)^2 + b^2}{(6 - d)^2 + c^2} )Cross-multiplying:( (25 + b^2)[(6 - d)^2 + c^2] = (36 + c^2)[(d - 5)^2 + b^2] )This looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a relationship between ( b ) and ( c ) from Equation (1). Let me recall Equation (1):( (c - b)(d - 5) = -b )Let me solve for ( c ):( (c - b)(d - 5) = -b )( c - b = frac{-b}{d - 5} )( c = b - frac{b}{d - 5} )( c = b left(1 - frac{1}{d - 5}right) )( c = b left(frac{d - 5 - 1}{d - 5}right) )( c = b left(frac{d - 6}{d - 5}right) )So, ( c = b cdot frac{d - 6}{d - 5} )Let me denote ( k = frac{d - 6}{d - 5} ), so ( c = k b ). Maybe this substitution can help simplify the equation.So, ( c = k b ), where ( k = frac{d - 6}{d - 5} )Now, let's substitute ( c = k b ) into the equation we got from the Angle Bisector Theorem:( (25 + b^2)[(6 - d)^2 + (k b)^2] = (36 + (k b)^2)[(d - 5)^2 + b^2] )Let me expand both sides:Left side:( (25 + b^2)[(6 - d)^2 + k^2 b^2] )Right side:( (36 + k^2 b^2)[(d - 5)^2 + b^2] )Let me denote ( (6 - d)^2 = (d - 6)^2 ) and ( (d - 5)^2 ) as is. Let me compute each term.First, compute ( (6 - d)^2 + k^2 b^2 ):( (d - 6)^2 + k^2 b^2 )Similarly, ( (d - 5)^2 + b^2 ) is just as it is.So, left side:( (25 + b^2)[(d - 6)^2 + k^2 b^2] )Right side:( (36 + k^2 b^2)[(d - 5)^2 + b^2] )Let me expand both sides:Left side:( 25(d - 6)^2 + 25 k^2 b^2 + b^2(d - 6)^2 + b^2 k^2 b^2 )Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, perhaps factor terms.Alternatively, maybe subtract right side from left side and set equal to zero.But this seems getting too complicated. Maybe I need another approach.Wait, another idea: since ( ell ) is the y-axis, and the distances from ( B ) and ( C ) to ( ell ) are 5 and 6, which are their x-coordinates. So, if ( B ) is at ( (5, b) ) and ( C ) is at ( (6, c) ), then ( AB ) is the distance from ( A(0,0) ) to ( B(5, b) ), which is ( sqrt{25 + b^2} ), and ( AC ) is ( sqrt{36 + c^2} ).But perhaps instead of coordinates, I can use areas or trigonometry.Wait, another thought: since ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), the distance from ( B ) to ( ell ) is 5, which is the length of the perpendicular from ( B ) to ( ell ). Similarly, the distance from ( C ) to ( ell ) is 6.But ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), so the distance from a point to ( ell ) can be related to the projection onto ( AD ).Wait, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry is the way to go, but perhaps I need to choose a different coordinate system.Alternatively, let me consider that ( AD ) is the angle bisector, and ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ) through ( A ). So, ( ell ) is the external angle bisector or something? Wait, no, it's just a line perpendicular to ( AD ) through ( A ).Wait, perhaps using trigonometry. Let me denote angle ( BAD = CAD = theta ). Then, since ( AD ) is the angle bisector, the angles at ( A ) are both ( theta ).Since ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), the angle between ( ell ) and ( AB ) is ( 90^circ - theta ), and similarly for ( AC ).Wait, maybe I can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. Since ( ell ) is a line through ( A ) perpendicular to ( AD ), and ( AD ) is the angle bisector.Let me denote ( AD = x ). Then, the distance from ( B ) to ( ell ) is 5, and from ( C ) to ( ell ) is 6.Wait, the distance from a point to a line can be expressed as ( frac{|ax + by + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} ), but since ( ell ) passes through ( A(0,0) ), the equation of ( ell ) can be written as ( y = m x ), where ( m ) is the slope. But since ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), and ( AD ) is the angle bisector, which we can consider as having a certain slope.Wait, maybe I need to parameterize ( AD ). Let me think.Alternatively, since ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), and both pass through ( A ), the angle between ( AB ) and ( ell ) is equal to the angle between ( AC ) and ( ell ) plus something? Hmm, not sure.Wait, another idea: the distance from ( B ) to ( ell ) is 5, which is equal to ( AB sin phi ), where ( phi ) is the angle between ( AB ) and ( ell ). Similarly, the distance from ( C ) to ( ell ) is 6, which is ( AC sin psi ), where ( psi ) is the angle between ( AC ) and ( ell ).But since ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), and ( AD ) is the angle bisector, maybe ( phi ) and ( psi ) are related.Wait, let me denote ( theta ) as the angle between ( AB ) and ( AD ), so ( theta = angle BAD ). Similarly, ( theta = angle CAD ). Then, since ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), the angle between ( AB ) and ( ell ) is ( 90^circ - theta ). Similarly, the angle between ( AC ) and ( ell ) is also ( 90^circ - theta ).Wait, is that correct? If ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ), then the angle between ( AB ) and ( ell ) would be ( 90^circ - theta ), because ( AB ) makes an angle ( theta ) with ( AD ), and ( ell ) is perpendicular to ( AD ). So, the angle between ( AB ) and ( ell ) is ( 90^circ - theta ).Similarly, the angle between ( AC ) and ( ell ) is also ( 90^circ - theta ), since ( AC ) also makes an angle ( theta ) with ( AD ).Therefore, the distance from ( B ) to ( ell ) is ( AB sin(90^circ - theta) = AB cos theta = 5 ).Similarly, the distance from ( C ) to ( ell ) is ( AC sin(90^circ - theta) = AC cos theta = 6 ).So, we have:( AB cos theta = 5 ) --- Equation (2)( AC cos theta = 6 ) --- Equation (3)Therefore, from Equations (2) and (3), we can write:( frac{AB}{AC} = frac{5}{6} )But from the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:( frac{AB}{AC} = frac{BD}{DC} )So, ( frac{BD}{DC} = frac{5}{6} )Therefore, ( BD = frac{5}{6} DC )Since ( BD + DC = BC ), we can write:( frac{5}{6} DC + DC = BC )( frac{11}{6} DC = BC )So, ( DC = frac{6}{11} BC ) and ( BD = frac{5}{11} BC )But I don't know the length of ( BC ). Hmm.Wait, maybe I can relate ( AD ) using the formula for the length of an angle bisector.The formula for the length of an angle bisector ( AD ) in triangle ( ABC ) is:( AD = frac{2 AB AC cos theta}{AB + AC} )Wait, is that correct? Let me recall the angle bisector length formula.Yes, the length of the angle bisector from angle ( A ) is:( AD = frac{2 AB AC cos theta}{AB + AC} )But from Equations (2) and (3), we have ( AB cos theta = 5 ) and ( AC cos theta = 6 ). So, ( cos theta = frac{5}{AB} = frac{6}{AC} ). Therefore, ( frac{5}{AB} = frac{6}{AC} ), which gives ( frac{AB}{AC} = frac{5}{6} ), which we already knew.So, ( AD = frac{2 AB AC cos theta}{AB + AC} )But ( AB cos theta = 5 ) and ( AC cos theta = 6 ), so ( cos theta = frac{5}{AB} ) and ( cos theta = frac{6}{AC} ). Therefore, ( frac{5}{AB} = frac{6}{AC} implies frac{AB}{AC} = frac{5}{6} ). Let me denote ( AB = 5k ) and ( AC = 6k ) for some positive real number ( k ).Then, ( cos theta = frac{5}{AB} = frac{5}{5k} = frac{1}{k} ). Similarly, ( cos theta = frac{6}{AC} = frac{6}{6k} = frac{1}{k} ). So, consistent.Now, plugging into the angle bisector formula:( AD = frac{2 AB AC cos theta}{AB + AC} = frac{2 times 5k times 6k times frac{1}{k}}{5k + 6k} )Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: ( 2 times 5k times 6k times frac{1}{k} = 2 times 5 times 6 times k times frac{1}{k} = 2 times 5 times 6 = 60 )Denominator: ( 5k + 6k = 11k )So, ( AD = frac{60}{11k} )Hmm, but I still have ( k ) in the denominator. I need another equation to find ( k ).Wait, maybe using the Law of Cosines on triangle ( ABD ) or ( ADC ). Let me consider triangle ( ABD ). We know ( AB = 5k ), ( AD = frac{60}{11k} ), and ( BD = frac{5}{11} BC ). But I don't know ( BC ).Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines on triangle ( ABD ) and ( ADC ).In triangle ( ABD ):( frac{AB}{sin angle ADB} = frac{AD}{sin angle ABD} )Similarly, in triangle ( ADC ):( frac{AC}{sin angle ADC} = frac{AD}{sin angle ACD} )But I don't know the angles ( angle ADB ) or ( angle ADC ). Hmm.Wait, another idea: since ( AD ) is the angle bisector, and we have the ratio ( frac{AB}{AC} = frac{5}{6} ), maybe we can use Stewart's Theorem to find ( AD ).Stewart's Theorem states that in triangle ( ABC ), with cevian ( AD ), where ( D ) divides ( BC ) into ( BD ) and ( DC ), then:( AB^2 cdot DC + AC^2 cdot BD = AD^2 cdot BC + BD cdot DC cdot BC )Given that ( frac{BD}{DC} = frac{5}{6} ), let me denote ( BD = 5m ) and ( DC = 6m ). So, ( BC = BD + DC = 11m ).Then, plugging into Stewart's Theorem:( AB^2 cdot 6m + AC^2 cdot 5m = AD^2 cdot 11m + 5m cdot 6m cdot 11m )Simplify:Divide both sides by ( m ):( AB^2 cdot 6 + AC^2 cdot 5 = AD^2 cdot 11 + 5 cdot 6 cdot 11 m^2 )But I don't know ( m ). Hmm.Wait, but earlier, I denoted ( AB = 5k ) and ( AC = 6k ). So, let me substitute that:( (5k)^2 cdot 6 + (6k)^2 cdot 5 = AD^2 cdot 11 + 330 m^2 )Compute left side:( 25k^2 cdot 6 + 36k^2 cdot 5 = 150k^2 + 180k^2 = 330k^2 )So, left side is ( 330k^2 )Right side: ( 11 AD^2 + 330 m^2 )Therefore:( 330k^2 = 11 AD^2 + 330 m^2 )Divide both sides by 11:( 30k^2 = AD^2 + 30 m^2 )So,( AD^2 = 30k^2 - 30 m^2 = 30(k^2 - m^2) )Hmm, but I still have two variables ( k ) and ( m ). I need another equation to relate ( k ) and ( m ).Wait, perhaps using the fact that ( BD = 5m ) and ( DC = 6m ), and from the Angle Bisector Theorem, ( frac{AB}{AC} = frac{BD}{DC} = frac{5}{6} ), which is consistent with ( AB = 5k ) and ( AC = 6k ).Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines on triangle ( ABC ). Let me denote ( BC = 11m ), ( AB = 5k ), ( AC = 6k ). Then, by the Law of Cosines:( BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 AB cdot AC cos angle BAC )But ( angle BAC = 2theta ), since ( AD ) is the angle bisector. So,( (11m)^2 = (5k)^2 + (6k)^2 - 2 cdot 5k cdot 6k cos 2theta )Simplify:( 121 m^2 = 25k^2 + 36k^2 - 60k^2 cos 2theta )( 121 m^2 = 61k^2 - 60k^2 cos 2theta )But from earlier, ( cos theta = frac{1}{k} ). So, ( cos 2theta = 2 cos^2 theta - 1 = 2 cdot frac{1}{k^2} - 1 = frac{2}{k^2} - 1 )Substitute into the equation:( 121 m^2 = 61k^2 - 60k^2 left( frac{2}{k^2} - 1 right ) )Simplify the right side:( 61k^2 - 60k^2 cdot frac{2}{k^2} + 60k^2 cdot 1 )( 61k^2 - 120 + 60k^2 )( (61k^2 + 60k^2) - 120 )( 121k^2 - 120 )So,( 121 m^2 = 121k^2 - 120 )Divide both sides by 121:( m^2 = k^2 - frac{120}{121} )So,( m^2 = k^2 - frac{120}{121} )Therefore,( k^2 - m^2 = frac{120}{121} )From earlier, we had:( AD^2 = 30(k^2 - m^2) = 30 times frac{120}{121} = frac{3600}{121} )Therefore,( AD = sqrt{frac{3600}{121}} = frac{60}{11} )So, ( AD = frac{60}{11} )**Final Answer**The length of ( AD ) is boxed{dfrac{60}{11}}."},{"question":"If Jenna has twice as much money in her bank account as Phil does, and Phil has one-third the amount of money that Bob has in his account, and Bob has 60 in his account, how much less money does Jenna have in her account than Bob?","answer":"First, determine how much money Phil has.

Hmm, that seems like a pretty big exponent. I remember something about modular arithmetic and maybe Fermat's Little Theorem could help here. Let me think through this step by step.First, I know that when dealing with exponents modulo a prime number, Fermat's Little Theorem can be useful. Fermat's Little Theorem states that if (p) is a prime number and (a) is an integer not divisible by (p), then (a^{p-1} equiv 1 mod p). In this case, 29 is a prime number, and 8 is not divisible by 29, so the theorem should apply here.So, according to Fermat's Little Theorem, (8^{28} equiv 1 mod 29). That means every 28th power of 8 will be congruent to 1 modulo 29. That's helpful because 900 is a multiple of 28? Let me check that.Wait, 28 times 32 is 896, right? Because 28*30 is 840, and 28*2 is 56, so 840+56=896. So 28*32=896. Then 900 minus 896 is 4. So, 900 = 28*32 + 4. So, (8^{900} = (8^{28})^{32} times 8^4). Since (8^{28} equiv 1 mod 29), then ((8^{28})^{32} equiv 1^{32} equiv 1 mod 29). So, (8^{900} equiv 1 times 8^4 mod 29). Therefore, I just need to compute (8^4 mod 29).Let me calculate (8^4). 8 squared is 64, and 64 squared is 4096. But 4096 is a big number, so maybe I can compute it step by step modulo 29 to keep the numbers smaller.First, compute (8^2 mod 29). 8*8=64. Now, 64 divided by 29 is 2 with a remainder of 64 - 29*2 = 64 - 58 = 6. So, (8^2 equiv 6 mod 29).Next, compute (8^4 = (8^2)^2). Since (8^2 equiv 6 mod 29), then (8^4 equiv 6^2 mod 29). 6 squared is 36. Now, 36 divided by 29 is 1 with a remainder of 36 - 29 = 7. So, (8^4 equiv 7 mod 29).Therefore, putting it all together, (8^{900} equiv 1 times 7 equiv 7 mod 29). So, the remainder when (8^{900}) is divided by 29 is 7.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with (8^2), that's 64, which modulo 29 is 6. Then (6^2) is 36, which modulo 29 is 7. That seems correct. So, (8^4) is indeed 7 modulo 29. And since 900 is 28*32 + 4, we have (8^{900} = (8^{28})^{32} times 8^4 equiv 1^{32} times 7 equiv 7 mod 29). Yeah, that seems right.Alternatively, maybe I can use another method to confirm. Let's compute the exponent step by step using smaller exponents and see if we can find a pattern or cycle.Compute powers of 8 modulo 29:- (8^1 equiv 8 mod 29)- (8^2 equiv 64 mod 29 equiv 6)- (8^3 = 8^2 times 8 equiv 6 times 8 = 48 mod 29 equiv 48 - 29 = 19)- (8^4 = 8^3 times 8 equiv 19 times 8 = 152 mod 29). Let's divide 152 by 29: 29*5=145, so 152 - 145=7. So, (8^4 equiv 7 mod 29)- (8^5 = 8^4 times 8 equiv 7 times 8 = 56 mod 29 equiv 56 - 29 = 27)- (8^6 = 8^5 times 8 equiv 27 times 8 = 216 mod 29). 29*7=203, so 216 - 203=13. So, (8^6 equiv 13 mod 29)- (8^7 = 8^6 times 8 equiv 13 times 8 = 104 mod 29). 29*3=87, so 104 - 87=17. So, (8^7 equiv 17 mod 29)- (8^8 = 8^7 times 8 equiv 17 times 8 = 136 mod 29). 29*4=116, so 136 - 116=20. So, (8^8 equiv 20 mod 29)- (8^9 = 8^8 times 8 equiv 20 times 8 = 160 mod 29). 29*5=145, so 160 - 145=15. So, (8^9 equiv 15 mod 29)- (8^{10} = 8^9 times 8 equiv 15 times 8 = 120 mod 29). 29*4=116, so 120 - 116=4. So, (8^{10} equiv 4 mod 29)- (8^{11} = 8^{10} times 8 equiv 4 times 8 = 32 mod 29 equiv 3)- (8^{12} = 8^{11} times 8 equiv 3 times 8 = 24 mod 29)- (8^{13} = 8^{12} times 8 equiv 24 times 8 = 192 mod 29). 29*6=174, so 192 - 174=18. So, (8^{13} equiv 18 mod 29)- (8^{14} = 8^{13} times 8 equiv 18 times 8 = 144 mod 29). 29*4=116, so 144 - 116=28. So, (8^{14} equiv 28 mod 29)- (8^{15} = 8^{14} times 8 equiv 28 times 8 = 224 mod 29). 29*7=203, so 224 - 203=21. So, (8^{15} equiv 21 mod 29)- (8^{16} = 8^{15} times 8 equiv 21 times 8 = 168 mod 29). 29*5=145, so 168 - 145=23. So, (8^{16} equiv 23 mod 29)- (8^{17} = 8^{16} times 8 equiv 23 times 8 = 184 mod 29). 29*6=174, so 184 - 174=10. So, (8^{17} equiv 10 mod 29)- (8^{18} = 8^{17} times 8 equiv 10 times 8 = 80 mod 29). 29*2=58, so 80 - 58=22. So, (8^{18} equiv 22 mod 29)- (8^{19} = 8^{18} times 8 equiv 22 times 8 = 176 mod 29). 29*6=174, so 176 - 174=2. So, (8^{19} equiv 2 mod 29)- (8^{20} = 8^{19} times 8 equiv 2 times 8 = 16 mod 29)- (8^{21} = 8^{20} times 8 equiv 16 times 8 = 128 mod 29). 29*4=116, so 128 - 116=12. So, (8^{21} equiv 12 mod 29)- (8^{22} = 8^{21} times 8 equiv 12 times 8 = 96 mod 29). 29*3=87, so 96 - 87=9. So, (8^{22} equiv 9 mod 29)- (8^{23} = 8^{22} times 8 equiv 9 times 8 = 72 mod 29). 29*2=58, so 72 - 58=14. So, (8^{23} equiv 14 mod 29)- (8^{24} = 8^{23} times 8 equiv 14 times 8 = 112 mod 29). 29*3=87, so 112 - 87=25. So, (8^{24} equiv 25 mod 29)- (8^{25} = 8^{24} times 8 equiv 25 times 8 = 200 mod 29). 29*6=174, so 200 - 174=26. So, (8^{25} equiv 26 mod 29)- (8^{26} = 8^{25} times 8 equiv 26 times 8 = 208 mod 29). 29*7=203, so 208 - 203=5. So, (8^{26} equiv 5 mod 29)- (8^{27} = 8^{26} times 8 equiv 5 times 8 = 40 mod 29 equiv 11)- (8^{28} = 8^{27} times 8 equiv 11 times 8 = 88 mod 29). 29*3=87, so 88 - 87=1. So, (8^{28} equiv 1 mod 29)Okay, so that confirms Fermat's Little Theorem here because (8^{28} equiv 1 mod 29). So, every 28 exponents, it cycles back to 1. So, (8^{900}) can be expressed as (8^{28*32 + 4}), which is ((8^{28})^{32} times 8^4). As we saw, (8^{28} equiv 1), so this simplifies to (1^{32} times 8^4 equiv 8^4 mod 29). And earlier, we found that (8^4 equiv 7 mod 29). So, that's consistent.Just to make sure, let me compute (8^4) again. (8^1=8), (8^2=64), which is 6 mod 29. (8^3=8*6=48), which is 19 mod 29. (8^4=8*19=152), which is 152 - 5*29=152 - 145=7. Yep, that's 7. So, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I can use another theorem or method, like Euler's theorem, but since 29 is prime, Euler's theorem is just Fermat's Little Theorem in this case. So, I think I'm on the right track.Another way to approach this is to find the order of 8 modulo 29. The order is the smallest positive integer (k) such that (8^k equiv 1 mod 29). From the earlier computations, we saw that (8^{28} equiv 1 mod 29), but maybe the order is less than 28. Let's check.We saw that (8^{28} equiv 1), but let's see if a smaller exponent also gives 1. Looking back at the powers:- (8^1=8)- (8^2=6)- (8^4=7)- (8^7=17)- (8^{14}=28)- (8^{28}=1)So, between 1 and 28, the exponents where the result is 1 are at 28. So, the order of 8 modulo 29 is 28. Therefore, 28 is the smallest positive integer for which (8^k equiv 1 mod 29). So, that means the cycle length is 28. Therefore, exponents repeat every 28. So, 900 divided by 28 gives a quotient and a remainder. As I calculated earlier, 28*32=896, so 900=28*32 + 4. Therefore, (8^{900} equiv 8^4 mod 29), which is 7.Alternatively, maybe I can use binary exponentiation or some other method, but I think the way I did it is solid.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute (8^4) again. 8*8=64, 64 mod 29 is 6. Then 6*8=48, 48 mod 29 is 19. Then 19*8=152, 152 mod 29. 29*5=145, so 152-145=7. Yep, that's 7. So, 8^4 is 7 mod 29.Alternatively, maybe I can compute (8^{900}) as ((8^{100})^9), but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe break down 900 into smaller exponents.Wait, 900=9*100, so maybe compute (8^{100}) first, then raise it to the 9th power. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that 900=28*32 +4, as before.Alternatively, maybe compute (8^{900}) mod 29 using the fact that 8 is a primitive root modulo 29? Wait, is 8 a primitive root modulo 29? The multiplicative order of 8 modulo 29 is 28, which is equal to 29-1, so yes, 8 is a primitive root modulo 29. Therefore, the powers of 8 generate all the residues modulo 29 except 0. So, that also tells us that the order is 28, which we already saw.Therefore, since 8 is a primitive root, the exponent cycles every 28. So, 900 mod 28 is 4, so (8^{900} equiv 8^4 equiv 7 mod 29).Wait, let me compute 900 mod 28 to confirm. 28*32=896, so 900-896=4. So, 900 mod 28 is 4. Therefore, (8^{900} equiv 8^4 equiv 7 mod 29). Yep, that's consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 8 is congruent to -21 mod 29, but I don't know if that helps. Let's see: 8 +21=29, so 8≡-21 mod 29. So, (8^{900} ≡ (-21)^{900} mod 29). But since the exponent is even, that's equal to (21^{900} mod 29). But I don't know if that helps because 21 is another number, and I don't know its order. Maybe it's more complicated.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 8 is 2^3, so (8^{900}=2^{2700}). Then, compute (2^{2700} mod 29). Maybe using Fermat's Little Theorem again, since 2 is also a primitive root modulo 29? Let me check.Compute the order of 2 modulo 29. Let's see, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^4=16, 2^7=128≡128-4*29=128-116=12, 2^14≡12^2=144≡144-4*29=144-116=28≡-1 mod29. So, 2^14≡-1 mod29. Therefore, 2^28≡1 mod29. So, the order of 2 is 28, same as 8. So, 2 is also a primitive root modulo29.Therefore, (2^{2700} mod29). Since the order is 28, 2700 divided by 28. Let's compute 2700 mod28.28*96=2688, so 2700-2688=12. So, 2700 mod28=12. Therefore, (2^{2700}≡2^{12} mod29). Compute 2^12.2^1=22^2=42^3=82^4=162^5=32≡32^6=62^7=122^8=242^9=48≡192^10=38≡92^11=182^12=36≡7 mod29.So, (2^{12}≡7 mod29). Therefore, (2^{2700}≡7 mod29), which is the same as (8^{900}≡7 mod29). So, that's another way to get the same result.So, whether I compute directly using 8 or express 8 as 2^3 and compute 2^2700, I end up with the same remainder of 7.Therefore, I'm pretty confident that the remainder when (8^{900}) is divided by 29 is 7.**Final Answer**The remainder when (8^{900}) is divided by 29 is boxed{7}."},{"question":"In a sample of five individuals, the respective values are a, 0, 1, 2, 3. If the sample mean is 1, what is the sample variance?","answer":"To determine the sample variance, I first need to find the value of ( a ).

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.First, let me understand what the question is asking. I have the number 2014, and I need to add some digits to the right of it—so, for example, if I add one digit, it becomes 2014d, where d is a digit from 0 to 9. If I add two digits, it becomes 2014dd, and so on. The goal is to find the smallest number of digits I need to add so that this new number is divisible by all natural numbers less than 10. That means it has to be divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.Wait, but divisibility by 1 is trivial because every number is divisible by 1. So, I can ignore that. So, effectively, I need the number to be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the smallest number of digits to append to 2014 such that 2014... is divisible by all these numbers.Let me think about the properties of numbers divisible by these. Maybe I can find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers because if a number is divisible by all of them, it must be a multiple of their LCM. So, perhaps I can compute the LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.Let me calculate that. The LCM of these numbers is the smallest number that all of them divide into. Let me factor each number:- 2 is prime: 2- 3 is prime: 3- 4 is 2²- 5 is prime: 5- 6 is 2×3- 7 is prime: 7- 8 is 2³- 9 is 3²So, the LCM would be the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So, primes involved are 2, 3, 5, 7.The highest power of 2 is 2³ (from 8), the highest power of 3 is 3² (from 9), and then 5 and 7 are to the first power. So, LCM = 2³ × 3² × 5 × 7.Calculating that: 2³ is 8, 3² is 9, so 8×9 is 72. Then, 72×5 is 360, and 360×7 is 2520. So, the LCM is 2520. That means the number we're looking for must be a multiple of 2520.So, the problem reduces to finding the smallest multiple of 2520 that starts with 2014. Or, more precisely, that is equal to 2014 followed by some digits. So, 2014 followed by k digits, such that this number is a multiple of 2520, and k is as small as possible.So, how can I approach this? Maybe I can model the number as 2014 followed by k digits. Let me denote this number as N = 2014 × 10^k + D, where D is the number formed by the k digits we append. So, N must be divisible by 2520, which is 2520.So, N ≡ 0 mod 2520. So, 2014 × 10^k + D ≡ 0 mod 2520.Therefore, D ≡ (-2014 × 10^k) mod 2520.But D is a k-digit number, so D must be between 0 and 10^k - 1.So, for each k starting from 1 upwards, I can compute (-2014 × 10^k) mod 2520, and see if that result is a k-digit number. If it is, then that D is the number to append, and k is the minimal number of digits needed.Alternatively, I can compute (2014 × 10^k) mod 2520, and then subtract that from 2520 to get D, but I have to be careful with the modulus.Wait, let me think again. If N = 2014 × 10^k + D ≡ 0 mod 2520, then D ≡ (-2014 × 10^k) mod 2520. So, D is equal to (2520 - (2014 × 10^k mod 2520)) mod 2520. So, if (2014 × 10^k mod 2520) is not zero, then D is 2520 minus that value. If it is zero, then D is zero, which is a k-digit number only if k=1 and D=0, but 0 is a single digit.But let's see. Let me compute 2014 mod 2520 first.2014 divided by 2520 is less than 1, so 2014 mod 2520 is 2014.So, 2014 × 10^k mod 2520 is equal to (2014 mod 2520) × (10^k mod 2520) mod 2520.So, 2014 mod 2520 is 2014, so we have 2014 × (10^k mod 2520) mod 2520.Therefore, we can compute 10^k mod 2520 for each k, multiply it by 2014, take mod 2520, and then D is equal to (2520 - result) mod 2520.But D must be a k-digit number, so D must be between 0 and 10^k - 1.So, for each k starting from 1, compute D as above, and check if D is a k-digit number. The first k for which D is a k-digit number is our answer.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute N = 2014 × 10^k + D, and N must be divisible by 2520. So, N must be a multiple of 2520, so N = 2520 × m for some integer m.So, 2014 × 10^k + D = 2520 × m.But since D is less than 10^k, we can write D = 2520 × m - 2014 × 10^k.So, D must be non-negative and less than 10^k.So, 2520 × m - 2014 × 10^k ≥ 0, and 2520 × m - 2014 × 10^k < 10^k.So, 2520 × m ≥ 2014 × 10^k, and 2520 × m < 2014 × 10^k + 10^k.So, 2520 × m is in [2014 × 10^k, 2014 × 10^k + 10^k).So, m must satisfy (2014 × 10^k)/2520 ≤ m < (2014 × 10^k + 10^k)/2520.So, m must be the smallest integer greater than or equal to (2014 × 10^k)/2520.So, for each k, compute m = ceiling[(2014 × 10^k)/2520], then compute D = 2520 × m - 2014 × 10^k, and check if D is less than 10^k.If yes, then k is the minimal number of digits needed.So, perhaps this approach is more straightforward.Let me try this.First, let me compute (2014 × 10^k)/2520 for k=1,2,3,... until I find a k where D is a k-digit number.Starting with k=1:Compute (2014 × 10)/2520 = 20140 / 2520 ≈ 8.0.So, m = ceiling(8.0) = 8.Then, D = 2520 × 8 - 2014 × 10 = 20160 - 20140 = 20.But D is 20, which is a two-digit number, but k=1, so D must be a single digit. So, 20 is not a single digit, so k=1 is invalid.Next, k=2:(2014 × 100)/2520 = 201400 / 2520 ≈ 80.0.So, m = ceiling(80.0) = 80.D = 2520 × 80 - 2014 × 100 = 201600 - 201400 = 200.But D=200 is a three-digit number, but k=2, so D must be two digits. 200 is three digits, so invalid.k=3:(2014 × 1000)/2520 = 2014000 / 2520 ≈ 800.0.m = ceiling(800.0) = 800.D = 2520 × 800 - 2014 × 1000 = 2,016,000 - 2,014,000 = 2,000.But D=2000 is a four-digit number, but k=3, so D must be three digits. 2000 is four digits, so invalid.k=4:(2014 × 10,000)/2520 = 20,140,000 / 2520 ≈ 8000.0.m = ceiling(8000.0) = 8000.D = 2520 × 8000 - 2014 × 10,000 = 20,160,000 - 20,140,000 = 20,000.D=20,000 is a five-digit number, but k=4, so D must be four digits. 20,000 is five digits, invalid.Hmm, I see a pattern here. For k=1, D=20; k=2, D=200; k=3, D=2000; k=4, D=20,000. Each time, D is 20 followed by k-1 zeros. So, for k=1, D=20, which is 20, but k=1 needs a single digit, so 20 is too big. Similarly, for k=2, D=200, which is three digits, but k=2 needs two digits, so 200 is too big.Wait, so maybe this approach isn't working because D is always 20 followed by k-1 zeros, which is k+1 digits? Wait, no, for k=1, D=20 is two digits, for k=2, D=200 is three digits, which is k+1. So, in general, D is 20 × 10^{k-1}, which is a (k+1)-digit number. So, for each k, D is a (k+1)-digit number, which is larger than k digits, so D will always be too big for the current k.Therefore, this suggests that for k=1,2,3,4,..., D is always too big. So, perhaps we need to find a k where D is less than 10^k.But in the above calculations, D is 20 × 10^{k-1}, which is 2 × 10^k. So, 2 × 10^k must be less than 10^k? Wait, that can't be, because 2 × 10^k is greater than 10^k for k ≥ 1. So, that suggests that for each k, D is 2 × 10^k, which is more than 10^k, so D is too big.Hmm, so maybe this approach is flawed. Perhaps I need to think differently.Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let me go back.I said that N = 2014 × 10^k + D, and N must be divisible by 2520. So, N ≡ 0 mod 2520.Therefore, 2014 × 10^k + D ≡ 0 mod 2520.So, D ≡ (-2014 × 10^k) mod 2520.So, D must be equal to (2520 - (2014 × 10^k mod 2520)) mod 2520.But D is a k-digit number, so D must be between 0 and 10^k - 1.Therefore, for each k, compute (2014 × 10^k) mod 2520, subtract that from 2520, and if the result is less than 10^k, then that's the D we need.So, let's compute (2014 × 10^k) mod 2520 for k=1,2,3,...But 2014 mod 2520 is 2014. So, 2014 × 10^k mod 2520 is equal to (2014 mod 2520) × (10^k mod 2520) mod 2520.So, 2014 mod 2520 is 2014, so we need to compute 2014 × (10^k mod 2520) mod 2520.So, let's compute 10^k mod 2520 for k=1,2,3,...Compute 10^1 mod 2520: 1010^2 mod 2520: 10010^3 mod 2520: 100010^4 mod 2520: 10000 mod 2520. Let's compute 2520 × 3 = 7560, 2520 × 4 = 10080. So, 10000 - 7560 = 2440. So, 10^4 mod 2520 = 2440.10^5 mod 2520: 10 × 2440 = 24400. 24400 / 2520: 2520 × 9 = 22680. 24400 - 22680 = 1720. So, 10^5 mod 2520 = 1720.10^6 mod 2520: 10 × 1720 = 17200. 17200 / 2520: 2520 × 6 = 15120. 17200 - 15120 = 2080. So, 10^6 mod 2520 = 2080.10^7 mod 2520: 10 × 2080 = 20800. 20800 / 2520: 2520 × 8 = 20160. 20800 - 20160 = 640. So, 10^7 mod 2520 = 640.10^8 mod 2520: 10 × 640 = 6400. 6400 / 2520: 2520 × 2 = 5040. 6400 - 5040 = 1360. So, 10^8 mod 2520 = 1360.10^9 mod 2520: 10 × 1360 = 13600. 13600 / 2520: 2520 × 5 = 12600. 13600 - 12600 = 1000. So, 10^9 mod 2520 = 1000.Wait, 1000 is the same as 10^3 mod 2520. So, the cycle repeats every 6 exponents? Because 10^3 mod 2520 is 1000, 10^9 mod 2520 is also 1000. So, the cycle length is 6.So, the pattern for 10^k mod 2520 cycles every 6 exponents. So, 10^1:10, 10^2:100, 10^3:1000, 10^4:2440, 10^5:1720, 10^6:2080, 10^7:640, 10^8:1360, 10^9:1000, and so on.So, knowing this, we can compute 2014 × (10^k mod 2520) mod 2520 for k=1,2,3,...But let's compute (2014 × (10^k mod 2520)) mod 2520 for each k:For k=1:2014 × 10 mod 2520 = 20140 mod 2520.Compute 2520 × 8 = 20160. So, 20140 - 20160 = -20. But mod 2520, that's 2520 - 20 = 2500.So, 2014 × 10 mod 2520 = 2500.Therefore, D ≡ (-2500) mod 2520 = 20.So, D=20, which is two digits, but k=1 requires a single digit. So, invalid.k=2:2014 × 100 mod 2520.Compute 2014 × 100 = 201400.201400 mod 2520.Compute how many times 2520 goes into 201400.2520 × 80 = 201600. So, 201400 - 201600 = -200. So, mod 2520, that's 2520 - 200 = 2320.So, 2014 × 100 mod 2520 = 2320.Therefore, D ≡ (-2320) mod 2520 = 200.D=200, which is three digits, but k=2 needs two digits. So, invalid.k=3:2014 × 1000 mod 2520.2014 × 1000 = 2,014,000.2,014,000 mod 2520.Compute 2520 × 800 = 2,016,000.So, 2,014,000 - 2,016,000 = -2,000. Mod 2520, that's 2520 - 2000 = 520.So, 2014 × 1000 mod 2520 = 520.Therefore, D ≡ (-520) mod 2520 = 2000.But D=2000 is four digits, but k=3 needs three digits. So, invalid.k=4:2014 × 10,000 mod 2520.2014 × 10,000 = 20,140,000.20,140,000 mod 2520.Compute 2520 × 8000 = 20,160,000.20,140,000 - 20,160,000 = -20,000. Mod 2520, that's 2520 - (20,000 mod 2520).Wait, 20,000 / 2520: 2520 × 7 = 17,640. 20,000 - 17,640 = 2,360.So, 20,000 mod 2520 = 2,360.Therefore, -20,000 mod 2520 = 2520 - 2,360 = 160.Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, 20,140,000 mod 2520.But 20,140,000 = 20,140,000.But 2520 × 8000 = 20,160,000, which is larger than 20,140,000.So, 20,140,000 - 2520 × 7990.Wait, 2520 × 7990 = 2520 × (8000 - 10) = 20,160,000 - 25,200 = 20,134,800.So, 20,140,000 - 20,134,800 = 5,200.So, 20,140,000 mod 2520 = 5,200 mod 2520.5,200 / 2520 = 2 × 2520 = 5,040. So, 5,200 - 5,040 = 160.So, 20,140,000 mod 2520 = 160.Therefore, D ≡ (-160) mod 2520 = 2520 - 160 = 2360.But D=2360 is four digits, and k=4, so D must be four digits. 2360 is four digits, so that's acceptable.Wait, so for k=4, D=2360, which is four digits. So, N = 2014 followed by 2360, which is 20142360.Is 20142360 divisible by 2520? Let me check.Divide 20142360 by 2520:20142360 ÷ 2520.Well, 2520 × 8000 = 20,160,000.20,142,360 - 20,160,000 = -17,640.Wait, that can't be. Wait, 20142360 is less than 20,160,000.Wait, 20142360 ÷ 2520.Let me compute 2520 × 8000 = 20,160,000.So, 20,142,360 is less than that. So, 2520 × 7990 = 20,134,800.20,142,360 - 20,134,800 = 7,560.7,560 ÷ 2520 = 3.So, 2520 × 7993 = 20,134,800 + 7,560 = 20,142,360.So, yes, 20142360 is divisible by 2520.Therefore, k=4 is the minimal number of digits needed, with D=2360.Wait, but let me check if there's a smaller k.Wait, for k=1,2,3, D was 20,200,2000, which were too big. For k=4, D=2360, which is exactly four digits. So, that works.But wait, is there a k=4 where D is less than 10^4=10000? Yes, 2360 is less than 10000, so it's valid.But just to make sure, let me check if for k=4, D=2360 is indeed the correct D.So, N = 2014 × 10^4 + 2360 = 20140000 + 2360 = 20142360.Divide 20142360 by 2520: as above, it's 7993, which is an integer, so yes, divisible.Therefore, the minimal number of digits to append is 4.But wait, let me check k=4 is indeed the minimal. For k=1,2,3, D was too big, so k=4 is the first k where D is a k-digit number.Therefore, the answer is 4 digits.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if for k=4, D=2360 is indeed the minimal.Is there a smaller k? For k=4, it's the first k where D is a k-digit number. So, yes, 4 is the minimal.Therefore, the smallest number of digits to append is 4.**Final Answer**The smallest number of digits that need to be appended is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Given the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, where a_1=5, and a_6+a_8=58, find the common difference d= _____ .","answer":"To find the common difference ( d ) of the arithmetic sequence, I start by using the formula for the ( n )-th term of an arithmetic sequence: ( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d ).Given that ( a_1 = 5 ), the sixth term ( a_6 ) is ( 5 + 5d ) and the eighth term ( a_8 ) is ( 5 + 7d ).According to the problem, the sum of the sixth and eighth terms is 58.

There are 4 finalists, and each contestant can choose any one topic from the 4 backup topics to perform their speech. The number of scenarios where exactly one of the topics is not selected by any of the 4 contestants is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a speech competition with 4 finalists. Each contestant can choose any one of 4 backup topics. I need to find the number of scenarios where exactly one of the topics is not selected by any of the 4 contestants. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, let me understand the problem. There are 4 contestants and 4 topics. Each contestant picks one topic. I need to count how many ways they can choose topics such that exactly one topic is left out—meaning that topic isn't chosen by any contestant, and the other three topics are each chosen by at least one contestant.So, in simpler terms, I need to find the number of functions from a set of 4 elements (contestants) to a set of 4 elements (topics) where exactly one element in the codomain (topics) is not mapped to by any element in the domain (contestants). This seems related to combinatorics and maybe the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall some concepts. The total number of ways the contestants can choose topics is 4^4, since each contestant has 4 choices. But that's the total number of possible scenarios without any restrictions.But we need the number of scenarios where exactly one topic is not selected. So, how do I compute that?I think I can approach this problem by first choosing which topic is going to be the one that's not selected. Since there are 4 topics, there are 4 choices for which topic is excluded. Once I've chosen the excluded topic, I need to count the number of ways the 4 contestants can choose from the remaining 3 topics, with the condition that all 3 topics are selected at least once. Because if exactly one topic is not selected, the other three must be selected by at least one contestant each.Wait, so this reduces the problem to counting the number of surjective functions from 4 elements to 3 elements. A surjective function is one where every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain. So, for each choice of the excluded topic, the number of valid assignments is equal to the number of surjective functions from 4 contestants to 3 topics.I remember that the number of surjective functions from a set of size n to a set of size k is given by the formula:k! times S(n, k)Where ( S(n, k) ) is the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets.So, in this case, n is 4 (contestants) and k is 3 (topics). Therefore, the number of surjective functions is:3! times S(4, 3)I need to find ( S(4, 3) ). From what I recall, the Stirling numbers of the second kind can be computed using the formula:S(n, k) = S(n - 1, k - 1) + k times S(n - 1, k)With the base cases ( S(n, 0) = 0 ) for ( n > 0 ), ( S(0, 0) = 1 ), and ( S(n, k) = 0 ) for ( k > n ).Alternatively, I can look up the value of ( S(4, 3) ). I think ( S(4, 3) = 6 ). Let me verify that. Yes, the number of ways to partition 4 elements into 3 non-empty subsets is 6. So, then:3! times 6 = 6 times 6 = 36So, for each excluded topic, there are 36 ways the contestants can choose the remaining 3 topics such that all are selected at least once.Since there are 4 choices for which topic is excluded, the total number of scenarios is:4 times 36 = 144Wait, hold on a second. Let me think again. Is that the correct approach?Alternatively, I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to compute the number of surjective functions. The formula for the number of surjective functions from n elements to k elements is:sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i binom{k}{i} (k - i)^nSo, in this case, n = 4, k = 3. Plugging in the numbers:sum_{i=0}^{3} (-1)^i binom{3}{i} (3 - i)^4Calculating each term:- For i = 0: ( (-1)^0 binom{3}{0} (3 - 0)^4 = 1 times 1 times 81 = 81 )- For i = 1: ( (-1)^1 binom{3}{1} (3 - 1)^4 = -1 times 3 times 16 = -48 )- For i = 2: ( (-1)^2 binom{3}{2} (3 - 2)^4 = 1 times 3 times 1 = 3 )- For i = 3: ( (-1)^3 binom{3}{3} (3 - 3)^4 = -1 times 1 times 0 = 0 )Adding these up: 81 - 48 + 3 + 0 = 36. So, that confirms that the number of surjective functions is indeed 36. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct.So, since there are 4 choices for the excluded topic, each contributing 36 scenarios, the total number of scenarios is 4 * 36 = 144.But wait, hold on another thought. Is that the final answer? Let me think about it differently.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the total number of assignments where exactly one topic is not selected by considering the number of ways to assign the contestants to topics such that one topic is missing, and the other three are covered.So, another way to think about it is:1. Choose which topic is not selected: 4 choices.2. Assign each contestant to one of the remaining 3 topics. However, we must ensure that all 3 topics are used at least once.This is exactly the same as counting the number of surjective functions from 4 contestants to 3 topics, which we already determined is 36. So, 4 * 36 = 144.Alternatively, another approach is to compute the total number of assignments, subtract those assignments where two or more topics are not selected. But that might complicate things because it involves inclusion-exclusion again.Wait, let me try that approach as a cross-check.Total number of assignments: 4^4 = 256.Now, subtract the number of assignments where at least one topic is not selected. But wait, no, that's not exactly what we want. We want exactly one topic not selected, so we need to compute the number of assignments where exactly one topic is not selected.In inclusion-exclusion terms, the number of assignments where exactly m topics are not selected is given by:binom{4}{m} times (4 - m)^4But that counts the number of assignments where at least m topics are not selected. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right.Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of inclusion-exclusion for exactly one topic being excluded.The formula for exactly one topic being excluded is:binom{4}{1} times (4 - 1)^4 - binom{4}{2} times (4 - 2)^4 + binom{4}{3} times (4 - 3)^4 - binom{4}{4} times (4 - 4)^4Wait, no, that's the inclusion-exclusion formula for the number of surjective functions, but in this case, we're looking for exactly one topic being excluded, which is different.Wait, actually, the number of assignments where exactly one topic is excluded is equal to the number of assignments where one specific topic is excluded, multiplied by the number of ways to choose that topic, but ensuring that the remaining topics are all used.Wait, that's exactly what I did earlier—choosing the excluded topic and then counting the surjective functions on the remaining topics.So, that gives 4 * 36 = 144.Alternatively, another way to compute this is:Number of ways = number of ways to choose the excluded topic * number of onto functions from 4 contestants to 3 topics.Which again is 4 * 36 = 144.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:First, choose which topic is excluded: 4 choices.Then, assign each contestant to one of the remaining 3 topics. However, we must ensure that all 3 topics are used. So, the number of such assignments is equal to the number of surjective functions from 4 elements to 3 elements, which is 36.So, 4 * 36 = 144.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as:The number of ways where exactly one topic is not selected is equal to the number of ways where one topic is excluded and the other three are each selected at least once.So, that's the same as 4 * (number of surjective functions from 4 to 3), which is 4 * 36 = 144.Wait, but let me think again. Is 36 the correct number of surjective functions?Yes, because the number of surjective functions from 4 elements to 3 elements is 3! * S(4,3) = 6 * 6 = 36.Alternatively, using inclusion-exclusion, as I did earlier, I got 36 as well.So, that seems consistent.Therefore, the total number of scenarios is 4 * 36 = 144.But wait, another thought: is this the same as the number of assignments where exactly one topic is not selected? Let me verify with a smaller case.Suppose there are 2 contestants and 2 topics. Then, the number of scenarios where exactly one topic is not selected would be 2 * 1 = 2, since each contestant must choose the other topic, but since there are 2 contestants, they both have to choose the same topic, so there are 2 possibilities. Alternatively, using the formula, it would be 2 * (number of surjective functions from 2 to 1). But wait, the number of surjective functions from 2 to 1 is 1, since both must map to the single topic. So, 2 * 1 = 2, which is correct.Similarly, in the case of 3 contestants and 3 topics, the number of scenarios where exactly one topic is not selected would be 3 * (number of surjective functions from 3 to 2). The number of surjective functions from 3 to 2 is 2! * S(3,2) = 2 * 3 = 6. So, 3 * 6 = 18. Alternatively, the total number of assignments is 3^3 = 27. The number of assignments where exactly one topic is not selected is 18, which makes sense because the number of assignments where all topics are selected is 6 (the number of permutations), so 27 - 6 - (number of assignments where two topics are not selected). Wait, no, that might complicate things.But in any case, the formula seems to hold in smaller cases, so I think it's correct.Therefore, going back to the original problem, the number of scenarios where exactly one topic is not selected is 4 * 36 = 144.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me think about another approach to confirm.Another way to compute this is:First, choose which topic is not selected: 4 choices.Then, for each contestant, they have 3 choices (the other topics). So, the total number of assignments is 4 * 3^4.But wait, that would be 4 * 81 = 324, which is way larger than 144. But that counts all assignments where a specific topic is excluded, but without the condition that all other topics are selected at least once.So, that's the total number of assignments where a specific topic is excluded, regardless of whether the other topics are covered.But we need the number of assignments where exactly one topic is excluded, meaning that the other three topics are each selected at least once.Therefore, from the 3^4 = 81 assignments where a specific topic is excluded, we need to subtract those assignments where one or more of the remaining topics are also excluded.So, in other words, for each excluded topic, the number of valid assignments is equal to the number of surjective functions from 4 contestants to 3 topics, which is 36, as we computed earlier.Therefore, 4 * 36 = 144 is indeed the correct number.Alternatively, using inclusion-exclusion for each excluded topic:Number of assignments where topic A is excluded: 3^4 = 81.But within these, some assignments may exclude topic B as well, or topic C, etc. So, to count the number of assignments where exactly topic A is excluded, we need to subtract the assignments where two topics are excluded.So, for each excluded topic, the number of assignments where exactly that topic is excluded is:Number of assignments excluding A: 3^4.Minus the number of assignments excluding A and B: 2^4.Minus the number of assignments excluding A and C: 2^4.Minus the number of assignments excluding A and D: 2^4.But wait, that's not quite right because when we subtract assignments excluding two topics, we might be over-subtracting.Wait, actually, the formula for the number of assignments where exactly one specific topic is excluded is:sum_{k=0}^{3} (-1)^k binom{3}{k} (3 - k)^4Wait, that's similar to the inclusion-exclusion formula for surjective functions.Wait, actually, for each excluded topic, the number of assignments where exactly that topic is excluded is equal to the number of surjective functions from 4 contestants to the remaining 3 topics, which is 36, as before.Therefore, for each excluded topic, 36 assignments, so 4 * 36 = 144.Alternatively, another way to compute it is:For each topic, the number of assignments where that topic is excluded and all others are included is 36. So, 4 * 36 = 144.Therefore, I think 144 is the correct answer.Wait, but let me think about another angle. Suppose I compute the total number of assignments, which is 4^4 = 256.Then, the number of assignments where exactly one topic is not selected is equal to the total number of assignments minus the number of assignments where all topics are selected (which is the number of surjective functions from 4 to 4, which is 4! = 24) minus the number of assignments where two or more topics are not selected.Wait, but that might complicate things because I need to compute the number of assignments where two or more topics are not selected.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach.But let me try this approach as well.Total number of assignments: 4^4 = 256.Number of assignments where all topics are selected: 4! = 24.Number of assignments where exactly one topic is not selected: ?Number of assignments where two topics are not selected: ?Number of assignments where three topics are not selected: ?Number of assignments where all four topics are not selected: 0, since each contestant must choose a topic.So, let's compute the number of assignments where exactly k topics are not selected, for k = 0,1,2,3.We know that the sum over k=0 to 4 of N(k) = 256, where N(k) is the number of assignments where exactly k topics are not selected.We need N(1).We can compute N(k) using inclusion-exclusion.The formula for N(k) is:N(k) = binom{4}{k} times (4 - k)^4Wait, no, that's not exactly correct because that counts the number of assignments where at least k topics are not selected.Wait, actually, the number of assignments where at least k topics are not selected is:sum_{i=k}^{4} binom{4}{i} times (4 - i)^4But that might not be directly helpful.Alternatively, the number of assignments where exactly k topics are not selected is:binom{4}{k} times sum_{i=0}^{4 - k} (-1)^i binom{4 - k}{i} (4 - k - i)^4Wait, that seems complicated.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the number of onto functions.Wait, the number of assignments where exactly k topics are not selected is equal to the number of ways to choose which k topics are excluded, multiplied by the number of surjective functions from 4 contestants to the remaining 4 - k topics.So, for exactly k topics excluded, the number is:binom{4}{k} times S(4, 4 - k) times (4 - k)!Wait, that seems more precise.So, for exactly k topics excluded, it's:1. Choose which k topics are excluded: ( binom{4}{k} ).2. Assign the 4 contestants to the remaining 4 - k topics such that each topic is selected at least once. The number of such assignments is ( (4 - k)! times S(4, 4 - k) ).Therefore, for k = 1:Number of assignments = ( binom{4}{1} times S(4, 3) times 3! ).Which is 4 * 6 * 6 = 144, which matches our previous result.Similarly, for k = 0:Number of assignments = ( binom{4}{0} times S(4, 4) times 4! ) = 1 * 1 * 24 = 24, which is correct (all topics are selected).For k = 2:Number of assignments = ( binom{4}{2} times S(4, 2) times 2! ).We know that ( S(4, 2) = 7 ), so 6 * 7 * 2 = 84.For k = 3:Number of assignments = ( binom{4}{3} times S(4, 1) times 1! ).( S(4, 1) = 1 ), so 4 * 1 * 1 = 4.For k = 4:Number of assignments = ( binom{4}{4} times S(4, 0) times 0! ).But ( S(4, 0) = 0 ) since you can't partition 4 elements into 0 subsets, so this is 0.Therefore, the total number of assignments is:N(0) + N(1) + N(2) + N(3) + N(4) = 24 + 144 + 84 + 4 + 0 = 256, which matches 4^4 = 256.So, that confirms that N(1) = 144 is correct.Therefore, the number of scenarios where exactly one topic is not selected is 144.Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about it in another way.Imagine assigning each contestant to a topic. We want exactly one topic to be unassigned. So, first, pick the unassigned topic: 4 choices.Then, assign the 4 contestants to the remaining 3 topics, making sure that each of those 3 topics is assigned to at least one contestant.This is equivalent to counting the number of onto functions from 4 elements to 3 elements, which is 3! * S(4,3) = 6 * 6 = 36.Therefore, for each choice of the unassigned topic, there are 36 assignments, so total is 4 * 36 = 144.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, another way to think about it is using multinomial coefficients.The number of ways to assign 4 contestants to 3 topics, with each topic getting at least one contestant, is equal to the number of onto functions, which is 36.Therefore, 4 * 36 = 144.So, I think I've verified it multiple ways, and all approaches lead to 144.Therefore, the answer should be 144.**Final Answer**The number of scenarios is boxed{144}."},{"question":"Arrange 8 numbers in a row from left to right. Starting from the third number, each number is exactly equal to the sum of the two previous numbers. If the 5th number and the 8th number are 53 and 225 respectively, what is the 1st number?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to arrange 8 numbers in a row from left to right. Starting from the third number, each number is exactly equal to the sum of the two previous numbers. I know that the 5th number is 53 and the 8th number is 225. I need to find the 1st number. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me denote the numbers as a sequence: let's say the first number is ( a_1 ), the second is ( a_2 ), and so on up to ( a_8 ). According to the problem, starting from the third number, each number is the sum of the two previous ones. So, that means:( a_3 = a_1 + a_2 )( a_4 = a_2 + a_3 )( a_5 = a_3 + a_4 )( a_6 = a_4 + a_5 )( a_7 = a_5 + a_6 )( a_8 = a_6 + a_7 )We know that ( a_5 = 53 ) and ( a_8 = 225 ). So, I can write down these equations:1. ( a_5 = 53 )2. ( a_8 = 225 )I need to express all these terms in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) so that I can solve for them. Let me try to express each term step by step.Starting with ( a_3 ):( a_3 = a_1 + a_2 )Then ( a_4 ):( a_4 = a_2 + a_3 = a_2 + (a_1 + a_2) = a_1 + 2a_2 )Next, ( a_5 ):( a_5 = a_3 + a_4 = (a_1 + a_2) + (a_1 + 2a_2) = 2a_1 + 3a_2 )We know ( a_5 = 53 ), so:( 2a_1 + 3a_2 = 53 )  ...(Equation 1)Moving on to ( a_6 ):( a_6 = a_4 + a_5 = (a_1 + 2a_2) + 53 = a_1 + 2a_2 + 53 )Then ( a_7 ):( a_7 = a_5 + a_6 = 53 + (a_1 + 2a_2 + 53) = a_1 + 2a_2 + 106 )Finally, ( a_8 ):( a_8 = a_6 + a_7 = (a_1 + 2a_2 + 53) + (a_1 + 2a_2 + 106) )Let me compute that:( a_8 = a_1 + 2a_2 + 53 + a_1 + 2a_2 + 106 )Combine like terms:( a_8 = 2a_1 + 4a_2 + 159 )We know ( a_8 = 225 ), so:( 2a_1 + 4a_2 + 159 = 225 )Subtract 159 from both sides:( 2a_1 + 4a_2 = 225 - 159 )Calculate 225 - 159:225 - 159 = 66So,( 2a_1 + 4a_2 = 66 )  ...(Equation 2)Now, I have two equations:Equation 1: ( 2a_1 + 3a_2 = 53 )Equation 2: ( 2a_1 + 4a_2 = 66 )I can solve these two equations simultaneously to find ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ). Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate ( 2a_1 ):( (2a_1 + 4a_2) - (2a_1 + 3a_2) = 66 - 53 )Simplify:( 2a_1 + 4a_2 - 2a_1 - 3a_2 = 13 )This simplifies to:( a_2 = 13 )Now that I have ( a_2 = 13 ), I can substitute this back into Equation 1 to find ( a_1 ):( 2a_1 + 3(13) = 53 )Calculate 3*13:3*13 = 39So,( 2a_1 + 39 = 53 )Subtract 39 from both sides:( 2a_1 = 53 - 39 )Calculate 53 - 39:53 - 39 = 14So,( 2a_1 = 14 )Divide both sides by 2:( a_1 = 7 )So, the first number is 7.

Therefore, (m = 3).For the variable (y), the exponent in the first monomial is (1) and in the second monomial is (n).

Given that g(n) satisfies the condition sum_{d mid n} g(d) = varphi(n) for any positive integer n, where the summation sum_{d mid n} indicates that d ranges over all positive divisors of n, find g(50).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find g(50) given that the sum of g(d) over all divisors d of n equals φ(n), which is Euler's totient function. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.First, I remember that Euler's totient function φ(n) counts the number of integers up to n that are coprime with n. So, for example, φ(5) is 4 because the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 are all coprime with 5. But I need to find g(50), and I know that the sum of g(d) over all divisors d of 50 equals φ(50). Wait, so if I can find φ(50), and then figure out the relationship between g(d) and φ(n), maybe I can solve for g(50). Let me recall that φ(n) can be calculated using the formula:φ(n) = n * product over all distinct prime factors of n of (1 - 1/p)So, for 50, which is 2 * 5^2, φ(50) would be 50 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 50 * 1/2 * 4/5 = 50 * 2/5 = 20. So φ(50) is 20.But how does that help me find g(50)? The problem says that for any positive integer n, the sum of g(d) over all divisors d of n equals φ(n). So, in other words, if I take all the divisors of 50 and sum up their g(d), I should get 20. But I need to find g(50) specifically.I think this is related to Möbius inversion. I remember that if we have two functions f and g such that f(n) = sum_{d|n} g(d), then g(n) can be expressed as f(n) minus the sum of g(d) over all proper divisors d of n. Or something like that. Maybe it's the Möbius function involved.Let me recall the Möbius inversion formula. It states that if f(n) = sum_{d|n} g(d), then g(n) = sum_{d|n} μ(d) * f(n/d), where μ is the Möbius function. Is that right? Or is it the other way around?Wait, actually, I think it's that if f(n) = sum_{d|n} g(d), then g(n) = sum_{d|n} μ(d) * f(n/d). So, in this case, f(n) is φ(n), and g(n) is what we're trying to find. So, according to Möbius inversion, g(n) should be equal to the sum over d dividing n of μ(d) * φ(n/d).Let me test this with a small n to see if it makes sense. Let's take n=1. Then, the only divisor is 1. So, φ(1) = 1, and g(1) should equal μ(1)*φ(1/1) = μ(1)*φ(1) = 1*1 = 1. That works because the sum over d|1 of g(d) is just g(1) = 1, which equals φ(1)=1.How about n=2? The divisors are 1 and 2. So, φ(2)=1. According to the formula, g(2) = μ(1)*φ(2/1) + μ(2)*φ(2/2) = μ(1)*φ(2) + μ(2)*φ(1) = 1*1 + (-1)*1 = 1 - 1 = 0. Hmm, so g(2)=0. Let's check: sum_{d|2} g(d) = g(1) + g(2) = 1 + 0 = 1, which is φ(2)=1. That works.Another test: n=3. Divisors are 1 and 3. φ(3)=2. So, g(3) = μ(1)*φ(3) + μ(3)*φ(1) = 1*2 + (-1)*1 = 2 -1 =1. Then, sum_{d|3} g(d) = g(1)+g(3)=1+1=2, which is φ(3)=2. Perfect.Okay, so the formula seems to hold for these cases. So, in general, g(n) = sum_{d|n} μ(d) * φ(n/d). So, for n=50, I can compute g(50) as the sum over d|50 of μ(d) * φ(50/d).First, let me list all the divisors of 50. 50 is 2 * 5^2, so its divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50.So, d can be 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50.Now, for each d, I need to compute μ(d) and φ(50/d).Let me compute μ(d) first:- μ(1) = 1- μ(2) = -1 (since 2 is prime)- μ(5) = -1 (since 5 is prime)- μ(10) = μ(2*5) = μ(2)*μ(5) = (-1)*(-1)=1- μ(25) = 0 (since 25 is 5^2, which has a squared prime factor)- μ(50) = μ(2*5^2) = 0 (since 50 has a squared prime factor 5^2)Okay, so μ(1)=1, μ(2)=-1, μ(5)=-1, μ(10)=1, μ(25)=0, μ(50)=0.Now, compute φ(50/d) for each d:- For d=1: φ(50/1)=φ(50)=20- For d=2: φ(50/2)=φ(25)=20*(1 - 1/5)=20*(4/5)=16- For d=5: φ(50/5)=φ(10)=10*(1 - 1/2)*(1 - 1/5)=10*(1/2)*(4/5)=10*(2/5)=4- For d=10: φ(50/10)=φ(5)=4- For d=25: φ(50/25)=φ(2)=1- For d=50: φ(50/50)=φ(1)=1So, φ(50/d) for each d is:- d=1: 20- d=2: 16- d=5: 4- d=10:4- d=25:1- d=50:1Now, multiply each μ(d) by φ(50/d):- d=1: 1 * 20 = 20- d=2: (-1) * 16 = -16- d=5: (-1) * 4 = -4- d=10: 1 * 4 = 4- d=25: 0 * 1 = 0- d=50: 0 * 1 = 0Now, sum all these up:20 -16 -4 +4 +0 +0 = (20 -16) + (-4 +4) + 0 + 0 = 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4.So, g(50) = 4.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, μ(d) for each d:- 1: 1- 2: -1- 5: -1- 10: 1- 25: 0- 50: 0That seems correct.φ(50/d):- d=1: φ(50)=20- d=2: φ(25)=20*(1 - 1/5)=16- d=5: φ(10)=4- d=10: φ(5)=4- d=25: φ(2)=1- d=50: φ(1)=1Yes, that's correct.Multiplying:- 1*20=20- (-1)*16=-16- (-1)*4=-4- 1*4=4- 0*1=0- 0*1=0Adding them up: 20 -16=4; 4 -4=0; 0 +4=4; 4 +0=4; 4 +0=4. So, total is 4.So, g(50)=4.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Since g(n) is the Möbius transform of φ(n), and φ(n) is multiplicative, then g(n) should also be multiplicative. So, since 50 is 2*5^2, and g is multiplicative, g(50)=g(2)*g(5^2).Let me compute g(2) and g(5^2).First, for n=2:Divisors are 1 and 2.Sum_{d|2} g(d) = φ(2)=1.So, g(1) + g(2) =1. We know g(1)=1, so 1 + g(2)=1 => g(2)=0. Which matches our earlier result.For n=5^2=25:Divisors are 1,5,25.Sum_{d|25} g(d) = φ(25)=20.So, g(1) + g(5) + g(25)=20.We know g(1)=1, and we can compute g(5) and g(25).Wait, let's compute g(5):For n=5, divisors are 1,5.Sum_{d|5} g(d)=φ(5)=4.So, g(1) + g(5)=4 => 1 + g(5)=4 => g(5)=3.Similarly, for n=25:g(1) + g(5) + g(25)=20.We have g(1)=1, g(5)=3, so 1 + 3 + g(25)=20 => 4 + g(25)=20 => g(25)=16.Wait, but earlier using Möbius inversion, for n=25, g(25)= sum_{d|25} μ(d)*φ(25/d).Divisors of 25: 1,5,25.Compute μ(d):- μ(1)=1- μ(5)=-1- μ(25)=0Compute φ(25/d):- d=1: φ(25)=20- d=5: φ(5)=4- d=25: φ(1)=1Multiply:- 1*20=20- (-1)*4=-4- 0*1=0Sum: 20 -4 +0=16. So, g(25)=16. Which matches the earlier result.So, since g is multiplicative, g(50)=g(2)*g(25)=0*16=0. Wait, that contradicts our earlier result of 4. Hmm, that's confusing.Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake here. Because 50 is 2 * 5^2, and if g is multiplicative, then g(50)=g(2)*g(5^2). But earlier, we found g(50)=4, but according to this, g(2)=0 and g(25)=16, so 0*16=0. That's a conflict.Wait, so which one is correct? Hmm.Wait, perhaps g is multiplicative, but only when n is square-free? Or maybe I messed up the multiplicative property.Wait, let me think again. The function g is defined such that sum_{d|n} g(d)=φ(n). So, if φ is multiplicative, then g must also be multiplicative because the Dirichlet convolution of multiplicative functions is multiplicative, and the Möbius function is multiplicative, so the inverse should be multiplicative.Wait, but in our case, g(n) is the Möbius transform of φ(n). Since φ is multiplicative, and Möbius inversion preserves multiplicativity, then g should be multiplicative.But in that case, why is there a discrepancy?Wait, let's compute g(50) using multiplicative property.g(50)=g(2*5^2)=g(2)*g(5^2)=0*16=0.But earlier, using Möbius inversion, we got g(50)=4.So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that g is multiplicative? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the Möbius inversion.Wait, let's compute g(50) both ways and see.First, using Möbius inversion, we got 4.Second, using multiplicative property, we got 0.But which one is correct? Let's check the sum over divisors of 50 of g(d) and see if it equals φ(50)=20.If g(50)=4, then sum_{d|50} g(d)=g(1)+g(2)+g(5)+g(10)+g(25)+g(50)=1 +0 +3 + something +16 +4.Wait, hold on. Wait, earlier, when we computed g(5)=3, and g(10)=?Wait, hold on, perhaps I need to compute all the g(d) for d|50.Wait, let's compute all g(d) for d|50:Divisors of 50: 1,2,5,10,25,50.Compute g(1): As before, sum_{d|1} g(d)=φ(1)=1. So, g(1)=1.Compute g(2): sum_{d|2} g(d)=φ(2)=1. So, g(1)+g(2)=1 => 1 + g(2)=1 => g(2)=0.Compute g(5): sum_{d|5} g(d)=φ(5)=4. So, g(1)+g(5)=4 => 1 + g(5)=4 => g(5)=3.Compute g(10): sum_{d|10} g(d)=φ(10)=4.Divisors of 10:1,2,5,10.So, g(1)+g(2)+g(5)+g(10)=4.We have g(1)=1, g(2)=0, g(5)=3. So, 1 + 0 + 3 + g(10)=4 => 4 + g(10)=4 => g(10)=0.Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Earlier, using Möbius inversion, I had g(10)=4, but that was when computing g(50). Wait, no, in the Möbius inversion for g(50), I used the formula and got 4, but that's g(50). But when computing g(10), using the definition, it's 0.Wait, so let's clarify:When I computed g(50) using Möbius inversion, I had to compute g(d) for all d|50, which includes g(1), g(2), g(5), g(10), g(25), g(50). But when I compute g(10), it's different.Wait, so perhaps I need to compute all these g(d) step by step.Let me list all the divisors and compute their g(d):1: sum_{d|1} g(d)=φ(1)=1 => g(1)=12: sum_{d|2} g(d)=φ(2)=1 => g(1)+g(2)=1 => 1 + g(2)=1 => g(2)=05: sum_{d|5} g(d)=φ(5)=4 => g(1)+g(5)=4 => 1 + g(5)=4 => g(5)=310: sum_{d|10} g(d)=φ(10)=4 => g(1)+g(2)+g(5)+g(10)=4 => 1 + 0 + 3 + g(10)=4 => 4 + g(10)=4 => g(10)=025: sum_{d|25} g(d)=φ(25)=20 => g(1)+g(5)+g(25)=20 => 1 + 3 + g(25)=20 => 4 + g(25)=20 => g(25)=1650: sum_{d|50} g(d)=φ(50)=20 => g(1)+g(2)+g(5)+g(10)+g(25)+g(50)=20 => 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 16 + g(50)=20 => 20 + g(50)=20 => g(50)=0Wait, so according to this, g(50)=0.But earlier, using Möbius inversion, I got g(50)=4. So, which is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Möbius inversion approach. Let me check that again.Möbius inversion formula: If f(n) = sum_{d|n} g(d), then g(n) = sum_{d|n} μ(d) * f(n/d).In this case, f(n)=φ(n), so g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d)*φ(n/d).So, for n=50, g(50)=sum_{d|50} μ(d)*φ(50/d).Divisors of 50:1,2,5,10,25,50.Compute μ(d):- μ(1)=1- μ(2)=-1- μ(5)=-1- μ(10)=1- μ(25)=0- μ(50)=0Compute φ(50/d):- d=1: φ(50)=20- d=2: φ(25)=20*(1 - 1/5)=16- d=5: φ(10)=4- d=10: φ(5)=4- d=25: φ(2)=1- d=50: φ(1)=1So, multiply μ(d) by φ(50/d):- d=1: 1*20=20- d=2: (-1)*16=-16- d=5: (-1)*4=-4- d=10:1*4=4- d=25:0*1=0- d=50:0*1=0Sum these up:20 -16 -4 +4 +0 +0=4.So, according to Möbius inversion, g(50)=4.But when I computed using the definition, step by step, I got g(50)=0.This is a contradiction. So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation.Wait, let's re-examine the step-by-step computation.We have:g(1)=1g(2)=0g(5)=3g(10)=0g(25)=16g(50)=?Sum over d|50 of g(d)=g(1)+g(2)+g(5)+g(10)+g(25)+g(50)=1 +0 +3 +0 +16 +g(50)=20 +g(50)=φ(50)=20.Thus, 20 +g(50)=20 => g(50)=0.But according to Möbius inversion, it's 4.Wait, so which one is correct?Alternatively, maybe I messed up the Möbius inversion.Wait, let me check the Möbius inversion formula again. It says that if f(n)=sum_{d|n} g(d), then g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) f(n/d).So, in this case, f(n)=φ(n), so g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) φ(n/d).So, for n=50, g(50)=sum_{d|50} μ(d) φ(50/d)=20 -16 -4 +4 +0 +0=4.But according to the step-by-step, it's 0.Wait, so which is correct?Wait, perhaps my step-by-step is wrong.Wait, let's think about it. If g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) φ(n/d), then for n=50, g(50)=4.But according to the definition, the sum over d|50 of g(d)=φ(50)=20.So, if g(50)=4, then the sum would be 1 +0 +3 +0 +16 +4=24, which is more than 20. That can't be.Wait, that's a problem. So, if g(50)=4, then the sum over d|50 of g(d)=24, which is not equal to φ(50)=20. So, that's a contradiction.Alternatively, if g(50)=0, then the sum is 20, which is correct. So, which is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Möbius inversion.Wait, let me think again. The Möbius inversion formula is correct, right? If f(n)=sum_{d|n} g(d), then g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) f(n/d).So, in this case, f(n)=φ(n), so g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) φ(n/d). So, for n=50, g(50)=sum_{d|50} μ(d) φ(50/d)=4.But then, the sum over d|50 of g(d)=24≠20.Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps my step-by-step is wrong.Wait, let's compute the sum over d|50 of g(d) using Möbius inversion.Wait, if g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) φ(n/d), then sum_{d|n} g(d)=sum_{d|n} sum_{k|d} μ(k) φ(d/k).Wait, that's a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of Dirichlet convolution.Wait, φ(n) is the convolution of g and the constant function 1, i.e., φ = g * 1, where * is Dirichlet convolution.Then, to get g, we have g = φ * μ, where μ is the Möbius function.So, g(n) = sum_{d|n} μ(d) φ(n/d).So, that should be correct.But then, when we compute the sum over d|50 of g(d), it should equal φ(50)=20.But according to Möbius inversion, g(50)=4, and if we compute the sum over d|50 of g(d)=1 +0 +3 +0 +16 +4=24≠20.So, that's a problem.Wait, perhaps my mistake is in assuming that g is multiplicative? Or perhaps I messed up the Möbius inversion.Wait, let me check the Möbius inversion again.Wait, the Möbius inversion formula says that if f(n)=sum_{d|n} g(d), then g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) f(n/d).So, in our case, f(n)=φ(n), so g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) φ(n/d).So, for n=50, g(50)=sum_{d|50} μ(d) φ(50/d)=20 -16 -4 +4 +0 +0=4.But when we compute the sum over d|50 of g(d)=1 +0 +3 +0 +16 +4=24≠20.Wait, that's a contradiction. So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the Möbius inversion is correct, and my step-by-step is wrong.Wait, let's compute the sum over d|50 of g(d) using the Möbius inversion results.If g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) φ(n/d), then sum_{d|50} g(d)=sum_{d|50} sum_{k|d} μ(k) φ(d/k).Wait, that's a double sum. Maybe we can swap the order of summation.Let me write it as sum_{k|d, d|50} μ(k) φ(d/k).Let me change variables: Let m = d/k. Then, d = k*m, and since d|50, k*m|50. So, k|m*50.Wait, this is getting complicated.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as sum_{d|50} g(d)=sum_{d|50} sum_{k|d} μ(k) φ(d/k).Let me let m = d/k, so d = k*m. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k|m*k|50} μ(k) φ(m).But I'm not sure if this helps.Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the sum over d|50 of g(d) using the Möbius inversion formula.Wait, but according to the problem statement, sum_{d|n} g(d)=φ(n). So, for n=50, it must be 20.But according to Möbius inversion, g(50)=4, and the sum over d|50 of g(d)=24≠20. So, that can't be.Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the Möbius inversion.Wait, perhaps I confused the roles of f and g in the Möbius inversion.Wait, the formula is: If f(n)=sum_{d|n} g(d), then g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) f(n/d).So, in our case, f(n)=φ(n)=sum_{d|n} g(d). So, g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) φ(n/d).So, that should be correct.Wait, but when I compute the sum over d|50 of g(d), it's 24, which is not equal to φ(50)=20.So, that suggests that either the Möbius inversion is wrong, which is unlikely, or my computation is wrong.Wait, let me recompute g(d) for each d|50 using Möbius inversion.Compute g(1)=sum_{d|1} μ(d) φ(1/d)=μ(1) φ(1)=1*1=1.g(2)=sum_{d|2} μ(d) φ(2/d).Divisors of 2:1,2.So, μ(1)φ(2/1)=1*1=1.μ(2)φ(2/2)=(-1)*φ(1)=(-1)*1=-1.Sum:1 -1=0. So, g(2)=0.g(5)=sum_{d|5} μ(d) φ(5/d).Divisors of 5:1,5.μ(1)φ(5)=1*4=4.μ(5)φ(1)=(-1)*1=-1.Sum:4 -1=3. So, g(5)=3.g(10)=sum_{d|10} μ(d) φ(10/d).Divisors of 10:1,2,5,10.Compute:μ(1)φ(10)=1*4=4.μ(2)φ(5)=(-1)*4=-4.μ(5)φ(2)=(-1)*1=-1.μ(10)φ(1)=1*1=1.Sum:4 -4 -1 +1=0. So, g(10)=0.g(25)=sum_{d|25} μ(d) φ(25/d).Divisors of 25:1,5,25.Compute:μ(1)φ(25)=1*20=20.μ(5)φ(5)=(-1)*4=-4.μ(25)φ(1)=0*1=0.Sum:20 -4 +0=16. So, g(25)=16.g(50)=sum_{d|50} μ(d) φ(50/d).Divisors of 50:1,2,5,10,25,50.Compute:μ(1)φ(50)=1*20=20.μ(2)φ(25)=(-1)*20=-20.μ(5)φ(10)=(-1)*4=-4.μ(10)φ(5)=1*4=4.μ(25)φ(2)=0*1=0.μ(50)φ(1)=0*1=0.Sum:20 -20 -4 +4 +0 +0=0. So, g(50)=0.Wait, so according to this, g(50)=0.But earlier, when I computed g(50) as sum_{d|50} μ(d) φ(50/d), I got 4. But now, when I compute it correctly, I get 0.Wait, what's the difference?Wait, in my initial computation, I had φ(50/d) for d=1,2,5,10,25,50 as 20,16,4,4,1,1.But when I recomputed, I think I made a mistake in φ(25).Wait, φ(25)=20*(1 - 1/5)=16, right? Because 25 is 5^2, so φ(25)=25*(1 - 1/5)=20.Wait, no, 25*(1 - 1/5)=20. So, φ(25)=20.Wait, but earlier, I thought φ(25)=20, but when I computed g(25), I had φ(25)=20.Wait, but in the initial computation for g(50), I had φ(25)=16, which was incorrect.Wait, no, wait. For d=2, φ(50/d)=φ(25)=20.Wait, no, 50/d when d=2 is 25, so φ(25)=20.Similarly, for d=5, 50/d=10, φ(10)=4.For d=10, 50/d=5, φ(5)=4.For d=25, 50/d=2, φ(2)=1.For d=50, 50/d=1, φ(1)=1.So, in the initial computation, I had:d=1: φ(50)=20d=2: φ(25)=20d=5: φ(10)=4d=10: φ(5)=4d=25: φ(2)=1d=50: φ(1)=1So, the φ(50/d) values are 20,20,4,4,1,1.Wait, but earlier, I thought φ(25)=16, which was wrong. φ(25)=20.So, that was my mistake.So, correcting that, let's recompute g(50):g(50)=sum_{d|50} μ(d) φ(50/d)=μ(1)*φ(50) + μ(2)*φ(25) + μ(5)*φ(10) + μ(10)*φ(5) + μ(25)*φ(2) + μ(50)*φ(1)=1*20 + (-1)*20 + (-1)*4 +1*4 +0*1 +0*1=20 -20 -4 +4 +0 +0=0.So, g(50)=0.Wait, so my initial mistake was that I incorrectly computed φ(25)=16 instead of 20. That's why I got 4 instead of 0.So, the correct value is g(50)=0.But then, when I computed step-by-step, I also got g(50)=0, which is consistent.So, the correct answer is g(50)=0.Wait, but let me confirm once again.Compute g(50)=sum_{d|50} μ(d) φ(50/d)=For d=1: μ(1)=1, φ(50)=20 => 1*20=20For d=2: μ(2)=-1, φ(25)=20 => (-1)*20=-20For d=5: μ(5)=-1, φ(10)=4 => (-1)*4=-4For d=10: μ(10)=1, φ(5)=4 =>1*4=4For d=25: μ(25)=0, φ(2)=1 =>0*1=0For d=50: μ(50)=0, φ(1)=1 =>0*1=0Sum:20 -20 -4 +4 +0 +0=0.Yes, so g(50)=0.Therefore, the correct answer is 0.Wait, but earlier, I thought that g(n)=sum_{d|n} μ(d) φ(n/d), which is correct, but I made a mistake in computing φ(25) as 16 instead of 20.So, the correct answer is g(50)=0.But wait, earlier, when I computed step-by-step, I got g(50)=0, which is consistent.So, the conclusion is that g(50)=0.Wait, but let me think again. If g(n)=0 for n>1, is that possible?Wait, no, because for n=2, g(2)=0, for n=5, g(5)=3, for n=10, g(10)=0, for n=25, g(25)=16, and for n=50, g(50)=0.So, it's not that g(n)=0 for all n>1, but rather, it's 0 for some n.So, in this case, g(50)=0.Therefore, the answer is 0.But wait, let me check the sum over d|50 of g(d)=1 +0 +3 +0 +16 +0=20, which is φ(50)=20. So, that's correct.Therefore, the correct value of g(50) is 0.So, after correcting my mistake in computing φ(25), I see that g(50)=0.**Final Answer**The value of ( g(50) ) is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 306 and 522.","answer":"To determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 306 and 522, I will use the Euclidean algorithm.First, I divide 522 by 306.

Let me try to understand what it's asking. Tom can control the time of flight, t, by choosing any speed up to v_max and any launch angle between 0° and 90°. We need to ignore air resistance, and Tom and Wes are at the same height. The question is asking which statement is incorrect among the options A to E.First, let me recall some projectile motion basics. When you throw a ball, the time it takes to reach the target depends on the initial speed and the angle. The horizontal and vertical motions are independent. The horizontal distance covered is given by l = v * cos(theta) * t, and the vertical motion is influenced by gravity, so the time of flight is t = (2 * v * sin(theta)) / g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity.So, combining these, the range l can also be expressed as (v² * sin(2theta)) / g. That's the standard range formula. So, for a given speed v, the maximum range is achieved at theta = 45°, and the maximum range is (v²) / g.Now, let's look at each option one by one.Option A: If v_max < sqrt(gl), the ball cannot reach Wes at all.Hmm. Let me think. The maximum range possible is (v_max²) / g. So, if (v_max²) / g < l, then the ball cannot reach Wes. So, solving for v_max, that would be v_max < sqrt(gl). So, yes, if v_max is less than sqrt(gl), the ball can't reach. So, statement A is correct. So, A is not incorrect.Option B: Assuming the ball can reach Wes, as v_max increases with l held fixed, the minimum value of t decreases.Okay, so if v_max increases, what happens to the minimum time? The minimum time would correspond to the minimum possible t for which l can be achieved. Since l is fixed, we can write l = (v² sin(2theta)) / g. To minimize t, which is (2 v sin(theta)) / g, we need to find the angle theta that gives the smallest t for a given v.Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of parametric equations. Let me express t in terms of l and v. From l = v * cos(theta) * t, so t = l / (v cos(theta)). Also, from vertical motion, t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g. So, equating these, l / (v cos(theta)) = (2 v sin(theta)) / g. So, l = (2 v² sin(theta) cos(theta)) / g = (v² sin(2theta)) / g.So, for a given l, v and theta must satisfy this equation. So, to find the minimum t, we can express t in terms of v and theta. From t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g, we can write sin(theta) = (g t) / (2 v). Also, from l = (v² sin(2theta)) / g, sin(2theta) = (2 l g) / (v²). But sin(2theta) = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta). So, substituting sin(theta) from above, we get 2 * (g t / (2 v)) * cos(theta) = (2 l g) / (v²). Simplifying, (g t / v) * cos(theta) = (2 l g) / (v²). Then, cos(theta) = (2 l g) / (v²) * (v / (g t)) ) = (2 l) / (v t).But from t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g, we have sin(theta) = (g t) / (2 v). So, using sin²(theta) + cos²(theta) = 1, we get [(g t)/(2 v)]² + (2 l / (v t))² = 1.This is a bit complicated, but maybe we can find the minimum t by considering calculus. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps for a fixed l, the minimum time occurs when the angle is as close to 0° as possible, but that might not be the case.Wait, actually, the time of flight is t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g. So, for a fixed l, which is (v² sin(2theta)) / g, we can write sin(2theta) = (l g) / (v²). So, 2 theta = arcsin((l g)/v²). So, theta = (1/2) arcsin((l g)/v²). Then, sin(theta) = sin[(1/2) arcsin((l g)/v²)]. Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe we can express t in terms of v. Let me solve for t. From l = (v² sin(2theta)) / g, and t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g. Let me express sin(2theta) as 2 sin(theta) cos(theta). So, l = (v² * 2 sin(theta) cos(theta)) / g. So, l = (2 v² sin(theta) cos(theta)) / g. From t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g, we can write sin(theta) = (g t) / (2 v). Plugging this into the equation for l: l = (2 v² * (g t / (2 v)) * cos(theta)) / g. Simplify: l = (2 v² * (g t / (2 v)) * cos(theta)) / g = (v * g t * cos(theta)) / g = v t cos(theta). So, l = v t cos(theta). So, cos(theta) = l / (v t). But from sin(theta) = (g t)/(2 v), we have sin(theta) = (g t)/(2 v). So, using sin²(theta) + cos²(theta) = 1, we get [(g t)/(2 v)]² + (l / (v t))² = 1.So, [(g² t²)/(4 v²)] + (l²)/(v² t²) = 1.Multiply both sides by 4 v² t² to eliminate denominators:g² t^4 + 4 l² v² = 4 v² t².Bring all terms to one side:g² t^4 - 4 v² t² + 4 l² v² = 0.This is a quadratic in t². Let me set x = t²:g² x² - 4 v² x + 4 l² v² = 0.Solving for x:x = [4 v² ± sqrt(16 v^4 - 16 g² l² v²)] / (2 g²).Simplify discriminant:sqrt(16 v^4 - 16 g² l² v²) = 4 v sqrt(v² - g² l²).Wait, but for real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative:16 v^4 - 16 g² l² v² ≥ 0 ⇒ v^4 - g² l² v² ≥ 0 ⇒ v²(v² - g² l²) ≥ 0.Since v² is always positive, we need v² ≥ g² l² ⇒ v ≥ g l. Wait, that can't be right because earlier we had v_max < sqrt(gl) for the ball not to reach. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.Wait, the discriminant is sqrt(16 v^4 - 16 g² l² v²) = 4 v sqrt(v² - g² l²). Wait, but that would require v² ≥ g² l², which would mean v ≥ g l, but that contradicts the earlier condition. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.Wait, let's go back. The equation after multiplying was:g² t^4 - 4 v² t² + 4 l² v² = 0.Let me write it as:g² t^4 - 4 v² t² + 4 l² v² = 0.Let me factor this equation. Maybe it's a perfect square.Let me see: (g t² - a v t + b l)^2? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, let me try to factor it as (g t² + m t + n)(g t² + p t + q). Hmm, this might be complicated.Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:g² t^4 - 4 v² t² + 4 l² v² = 0.Let me divide both sides by v^4 to make it dimensionless:(g² / v^4) t^4 - (4 / v²) t² + 4 (l² / v²) = 0.Let me set u = t² / v². Then, t² = u v², and t^4 = u² v^4.Substituting:g² u² v^4 - 4 u v^4 + 4 l² v² = 0.Divide both sides by v^4:g² u² - 4 u + 4 l² / v² = 0.This is a quadratic in u:g² u² - 4 u + (4 l² / v²) = 0.Solving for u:u = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 16 g² (l² / v²))]/(2 g²).Simplify discriminant:sqrt(16 - 16 g² l² / v²) = 4 sqrt(1 - g² l² / v²).So,u = [4 ± 4 sqrt(1 - g² l² / v²)] / (2 g²) = [2 ± 2 sqrt(1 - g² l² / v²)] / g².Since u = t² / v², we have:t² = v² [2 ± 2 sqrt(1 - g² l² / v²)] / g².So,t = v * sqrt[2 ± 2 sqrt(1 - g² l² / v²)] / g.This is getting complicated. Maybe instead of going this route, I can think about the relationship between t and v.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression for t in terms of v and theta. Since t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g, and l = (v² sin(2theta)) / g, we can express sin(2theta) = (l g) / v². So, sin(2theta) must be ≤ 1, so (l g)/v² ≤ 1 ⇒ v ≥ sqrt(g l). So, that's consistent with option A.Now, for a given l, as v increases beyond sqrt(g l), what happens to t? Let's see. For a fixed l, if v increases, what's the effect on t?From t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g, and sin(theta) = (g t)/(2 v). So, as v increases, sin(theta) decreases, meaning theta decreases. So, the angle becomes more shallow.But how does t change? Let's see. For a given l, if v increases, can t decrease?Wait, let's think about the case where theta approaches 0°. If theta is very small, then sin(theta) ≈ theta (in radians), and sin(2theta) ≈ 2 theta. So, l ≈ (v² * 2 theta) / g. So, theta ≈ (g l) / (2 v²). Then, t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g ≈ (2 v * theta) / g ≈ (2 v * (g l)/(2 v²)) / g = (g l / v) / g = l / v. So, as v increases, t approaches l / v, which decreases. So, the minimum time t_min is l / v_max, achieved when theta approaches 0°. So, as v_max increases, t_min decreases. So, statement B is correct.Option C: Assuming the ball can reach Wes, as v_max increases with l held fixed, the maximum value of t increases.Hmm. The maximum time would occur when the angle is such that the time is maximized. Since t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g, for a given v, the maximum t occurs at theta = 90°, which gives t = 2 v / g. But wait, can we throw the ball at 90° and still reach Wes? If theta is 90°, then the horizontal distance l would be zero, because cos(theta) is zero. So, that's not possible. So, the maximum t for a given l must be less than 2 v / g.Wait, so to maximize t, we need to find the angle theta that gives the maximum t while still achieving l. So, perhaps the maximum t occurs at a certain angle less than 90°. Let me think.From the earlier equation, t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g, and l = (v² sin(2theta)) / g. So, for a given l and v, sin(2theta) = (l g) / v². Let me denote k = (l g) / v². So, sin(2theta) = k, which implies that 2theta = arcsin(k), so theta = (1/2) arcsin(k). So, sin(theta) = sin[(1/2) arcsin(k)]. Let me express sin(theta) in terms of k.Using the identity sin(arcsin(k)/2) = sqrt[(1 - cos(arcsin(k)))/2]. Since cos(arcsin(k)) = sqrt(1 - k²), so sin(theta) = sqrt[(1 - sqrt(1 - k²))/2].Then, t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g = (2 v / g) * sqrt[(1 - sqrt(1 - k²))/2].But k = (l g) / v², so let's substitute that:t = (2 v / g) * sqrt[(1 - sqrt(1 - (l² g²)/v^4))/2].This is getting complicated, but perhaps we can analyze the behavior as v increases.As v increases, k = (l g)/v² decreases. So, sqrt(1 - k²) approaches 1, so 1 - sqrt(1 - k²) approaches 0. So, the expression inside the square root becomes small, so t approaches (2 v / g) * sqrt(small value). Hmm, but as v increases, does t increase or decrease?Wait, let's consider the limit as v approaches infinity. Then, k approaches 0, so sin(2theta) approaches 0, so theta approaches 0. Then, t approaches (2 v sin(theta))/g. But sin(theta) ≈ theta ≈ (g l)/(2 v²), so t ≈ (2 v * (g l)/(2 v²)) / g = (g l / v) / g = l / v, which approaches 0. So, as v increases, t approaches 0. But that's the minimum time. So, the maximum t must occur at some finite v.Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think about for a fixed l, what's the maximum possible t. The maximum t would occur when the projectile is thrown at the angle that gives the maximum possible time for that range. So, perhaps it's when the projectile is thrown at an angle greater than 45°, but not too much that the range decreases.Wait, actually, for a given range l, the maximum time occurs when the projectile is thrown at an angle greater than 45°, because higher angles give longer time of flight, but they also require higher speed to maintain the same range. Wait, but in this case, v is fixed, but in our problem, v can be up to v_max, which is increasing.Wait, no, in option C, v_max is increasing, but l is fixed. So, for a given l, as v_max increases, can we achieve a longer time?Wait, when v increases, the maximum possible time for a given l would be when the angle is chosen to maximize t. So, perhaps for a given l, the maximum t occurs at a certain angle, and as v increases, that maximum t increases.Wait, let me think of it this way: for a given l, the time t is given by t = (2 v sin(theta)) / g, and l = (v² sin(2theta)) / g. So, for a given l, as v increases, we can choose a larger theta to get a longer t. Because sin(theta) increases as theta increases up to 90°, but sin(2theta) first increases to 90°, then decreases. So, for a given l, as v increases, we can choose a theta that's higher, leading to a higher t.Wait, let me test with an example. Suppose l is fixed, say l = 10 meters, and g = 10 m/s² for simplicity.Case 1: v = 10 m/s.Then, l = (v² sin(2theta))/g ⇒ 10 = (100 sin(2theta))/10 ⇒ sin(2theta) = 1 ⇒ 2theta = 90° ⇒ theta = 45°. Then, t = (2 * 10 * sin(45°))/10 = (20 * √2/2)/10 = (10√2)/10 = √2 ≈ 1.414 seconds.Case 2: v = 20 m/s.Then, l = (400 sin(2theta))/10 ⇒ 10 = 40 sin(2theta) ⇒ sin(2theta) = 0.25 ⇒ 2theta ≈ 14.477° ⇒ theta ≈ 7.238°. Then, t = (2 * 20 * sin(7.238°))/10 ≈ (40 * 0.125)/10 ≈ 5/10 = 0.5 seconds.Wait, that's a shorter time. Hmm, but that's the minimum time. What about the maximum time?Wait, for a given l and v, there are two possible angles: one less than 45°, giving a shorter time, and one greater than 45°, giving a longer time. So, for v = 20 m/s, l = 10 m, sin(2theta) = 0.25, so 2theta can be 14.477° or 165.523°, so theta can be 7.238° or 82.762°.Calculating t for theta = 82.762°:sin(theta) ≈ sin(82.762°) ≈ 0.992.So, t = (2 * 20 * 0.992)/10 ≈ (40 * 0.992)/10 ≈ 39.68 / 10 ≈ 3.968 seconds.So, for v = 20 m/s, the maximum t is approximately 3.968 seconds, which is longer than the 1.414 seconds when v = 10 m/s.So, as v increases, the maximum t increases. So, statement C is correct.Option D: Assuming the ball can reach Wes, as l increases with v_max held fixed, the minimum value of t increases.Hmm. So, if l increases while v_max is fixed, what happens to the minimum t? The minimum t occurs when the ball is thrown at the angle that gives the shortest possible time for that l. As we saw earlier, the minimum time is achieved when the angle is as small as possible, approaching 0°, giving t ≈ l / v_max.So, if l increases, and v_max is fixed, then t_min = l / v_max increases. So, yes, as l increases, t_min increases. So, statement D is correct.Option E: Assuming the ball can reach Wes, as l increases with v_max held fixed, the maximum value of t increases.Hmm. So, as l increases, with v_max fixed, does the maximum t increase? Let's think.The maximum t occurs when the ball is thrown at the angle that gives the maximum possible time for that l. As l increases, we can achieve longer times by throwing the ball at higher angles.Wait, but with v_max fixed, as l increases, the required angle to reach that l might require a higher angle, but the time of flight also depends on the angle. Let me think with an example.Suppose v_max = 10 m/s, g = 10 m/s².Case 1: l = 10 m.As before, theta = 45°, t = √2 ≈ 1.414 s.Case 2: l = 20 m.Wait, can we reach 20 m with v_max = 10 m/s? The maximum range is (v_max²)/g = 100/10 = 10 m. So, l cannot be 20 m. So, in this case, l cannot increase beyond 10 m if v_max is fixed at 10 m/s.Wait, but the problem says \\"assuming the ball can reach Wes\\", so l must be ≤ (v_max²)/g. So, as l increases, up to (v_max²)/g, what happens to the maximum t?Wait, for a given v_max, the maximum t occurs when l is as large as possible, which is at l = (v_max²)/g, achieved at theta = 45°. So, t_max at l = (v_max²)/g is t = (2 v_max sin(45°))/g = (2 v_max (√2/2))/g = (v_max √2)/g.So, as l increases towards (v_max²)/g, the maximum t increases, reaching its maximum at l = (v_max²)/g.Wait, but if l is less than (v_max²)/g, can we have a higher t by choosing a different angle? For example, if l is smaller, can we throw the ball at a higher angle to get a longer time?Wait, let's take v_max = 10 m/s, g = 10 m/s².Case 1: l = 5 m.Then, l = (v² sin(2theta))/g ⇒ 5 = (100 sin(2theta))/10 ⇒ sin(2theta) = 0.5 ⇒ 2theta = 30° or 150° ⇒ theta = 15° or 75°.Calculating t for theta = 15°:t = (2 * 10 * sin(15°))/10 ≈ (20 * 0.2588)/10 ≈ 5.176/10 ≈ 0.5176 s.For theta = 75°:t = (2 * 10 * sin(75°))/10 ≈ (20 * 0.9659)/10 ≈ 19.318/10 ≈ 1.9318 s.So, for l = 5 m, the maximum t is approximately 1.9318 s, which is less than the maximum t when l = 10 m, which was 1.414 s? Wait, no, wait, when l = 10 m, t was 1.414 s, but when l = 5 m, the maximum t is 1.9318 s, which is longer. So, as l decreases, the maximum t increases? That seems contradictory.Wait, that can't be right. Wait, when l is smaller, you can throw the ball at a higher angle, which gives a longer time of flight, even though the range is smaller. So, for a fixed v_max, as l decreases, the maximum t increases. Conversely, as l increases, the maximum t decreases, reaching its minimum at l = (v_max²)/g, which is the maximum range.Wait, that seems to contradict my earlier thought. Let me check with another example.v_max = 10 m/s, g = 10 m/s².Case 1: l = 10 m (maximum range). Theta = 45°, t = 1.414 s.Case 2: l = 5 m. Theta = 75°, t ≈ 1.9318 s.Case 3: l = 0 m. Theta = 90°, t = 2 * 10 / 10 = 2 s.So, as l decreases from 10 m to 0 m, the maximum t increases from 1.414 s to 2 s.Therefore, as l increases, the maximum t decreases. So, if l increases with v_max fixed, the maximum t decreases, not increases. So, statement E is incorrect.Wait, but the question is asking which statement is incorrect. So, if E says that as l increases with v_max fixed, the maximum t increases, but in reality, it decreases, then E is incorrect.Wait, but let me think again. When l increases, we can only go up to l = (v_max²)/g. Beyond that, the ball can't reach. So, for l less than (v_max²)/g, as l increases, the maximum t decreases. So, statement E is incorrect because it claims that the maximum t increases as l increases, which is false.Wait, but let me confirm with another example.v_max = 10 m/s, g = 10 m/s².Case 1: l = 5 m. Maximum t ≈ 1.9318 s.Case 2: l = 7.5 m.Then, l = (100 sin(2theta))/10 ⇒ 7.5 = 10 sin(2theta) ⇒ sin(2theta) = 0.75 ⇒ 2theta ≈ 48.59° or 131.41° ⇒ theta ≈ 24.295° or 65.705°.Calculating t for theta ≈ 65.705°:sin(theta) ≈ sin(65.705°) ≈ 0.91.t = (2 * 10 * 0.91)/10 ≈ 18.2 / 10 ≈ 1.82 s.So, for l = 7.5 m, the maximum t is approximately 1.82 s, which is less than the 1.9318 s for l = 5 m, but more than the 1.414 s for l = 10 m.So, as l increases from 5 m to 7.5 m, the maximum t decreases from ~1.93 s to ~1.82 s.Similarly, as l approaches 10 m, the maximum t approaches ~1.414 s.So, yes, as l increases, the maximum t decreases, so statement E is incorrect.Wait, but let me check the exact relationship. For a fixed v_max, the maximum t occurs at the angle theta where sin(2theta) = (l g)/v_max². So, as l increases, sin(2theta) increases, so 2theta increases up to 90°, then decreases beyond that. Wait, no, sin(2theta) can only go up to 1, so 2theta can go up to 90°, meaning theta up to 45°, beyond which sin(2theta) starts decreasing.Wait, no, that's not correct. For l increasing, sin(2theta) increases until l reaches (v_max²)/g, at which point sin(2theta) = 1, and 2theta = 90°, theta = 45°. Beyond that, l cannot increase because the maximum range is achieved.So, for l less than (v_max²)/g, as l increases, sin(2theta) increases, so 2theta increases, meaning theta increases up to 45°, and beyond that, theta would have to decrease, but since l can't exceed (v_max²)/g, theta can't go beyond 45°.Wait, no, actually, for l less than (v_max²)/g, there are two angles: one less than 45° and one greater than 45°. The maximum t occurs at the greater angle. So, as l increases, the greater angle decreases towards 45°, so the maximum t decreases.Wait, let me think. For l = 0, theta = 90°, t = 2 v_max / g.As l increases, the angle theta for maximum t decreases from 90° towards 45°, so the maximum t decreases from 2 v_max / g towards (2 v_max sin(45°))/g = v_max √2 / g.So, as l increases, the maximum t decreases. Therefore, statement E is incorrect because it claims that as l increases, the maximum t increases, which is false.So, the incorrect statement is E.But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Because in the example with l = 5 m, the maximum t was higher than when l = 7.5 m, which was higher than when l = 10 m. So, as l increases, the maximum t decreases. Therefore, statement E is incorrect.So, the answer should be E."},{"question":"A two-digit number is a multiple of 2. Adding 1 to this number results in a multiple of 3.

The cost of constructing the bottom of the tank is 40 yuan per square meter, and the cost of constructing the walls is 20 yuan per square meter. What dimensions should the tank have to minimize the total construction cost, and what is the minimum total cost?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a unit wants to build an open-top rectangular water tank. The volume is given as 48 cubic meters, and the depth is 3 meters. The cost for the bottom is 40 yuan per square meter, and the walls are 20 yuan per square meter. I need to figure out the dimensions that will minimize the total construction cost and also find that minimum cost.Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. It's an open-top tank, so it doesn't have a top, only a bottom and four walls. The volume is fixed at 48 m³, and the depth (which I think is the height) is 3 meters. So, the height is fixed, which might simplify things.Let me visualize the tank. It's a rectangular prism, open at the top. So, it has a base (the bottom) and four sides (the walls). The base has a certain length and width, and the height is 3 meters.Given that, I can denote the length as 'x' meters and the width as 'y' meters. The height is given as 3 meters. So, the volume of the tank is length × width × height, which is x * y * 3 = 48 m³. So, that gives me an equation:3xy = 48Simplifying that, I get:xy = 16So, the product of length and width is 16. That's one equation.Now, the cost is involved. The bottom costs 40 yuan per square meter, and the walls cost 20 yuan per square meter. So, I need to calculate the area of the bottom and the areas of the walls, then multiply by their respective costs and sum them up to get the total cost. Then, I need to minimize that cost.Let me write expressions for the areas.First, the area of the bottom is just length × width, which is x * y. So, the cost for the bottom is 40 * x * y.Next, the walls. Since it's a rectangular tank, there are two pairs of identical walls. One pair has dimensions length × height, and the other pair has width × height.So, the area of the two longer walls is 2 * (x * 3), and the area of the two shorter walls is 2 * (y * 3). Therefore, the total area of the walls is 2*(3x) + 2*(3y) = 6x + 6y.But wait, let me check that. Each pair of walls: two walls have area x * 3 each, so total for those is 2*(3x) = 6x. Similarly, the other two walls have area y * 3 each, so total is 2*(3y) = 6y. So, total wall area is 6x + 6y. That seems correct.So, the cost for the walls is 20 yuan per square meter, so total wall cost is 20*(6x + 6y) = 120x + 120y.Therefore, the total cost C is the sum of the bottom cost and the walls cost:C = 40xy + 120x + 120yBut from the volume equation, I know that xy = 16. So, I can substitute that into the cost equation.So, C = 40*16 + 120x + 120yCalculating 40*16, that's 640. So,C = 640 + 120x + 120yHmm, so now I have the total cost in terms of x and y, but I need to express it in terms of a single variable to minimize it. Since I have the constraint that xy = 16, I can express y in terms of x or vice versa.Let me solve for y in terms of x. From xy = 16, we get y = 16/x.So, substituting y = 16/x into the cost equation:C = 640 + 120x + 120*(16/x)Simplify that:C = 640 + 120x + (1920)/xSo, now the cost is expressed as a function of x:C(x) = 640 + 120x + 1920/xNow, to find the minimum cost, I need to find the value of x that minimizes C(x). Since this is a calculus problem, I can take the derivative of C with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x.Let me compute the derivative C'(x):C'(x) = d/dx [640 + 120x + 1920/x]The derivative of 640 is 0. The derivative of 120x is 120. The derivative of 1920/x is -1920/x².So,C'(x) = 120 - 1920/x²To find the critical points, set C'(x) = 0:120 - 1920/x² = 0Let me solve for x:120 = 1920/x²Multiply both sides by x²:120x² = 1920Divide both sides by 120:x² = 1920 / 120Calculate that:1920 ÷ 120 = 16So,x² = 16Taking square roots:x = 4 or x = -4But since x is a length, it can't be negative. So, x = 4 meters.Now, let's find y using y = 16/x:y = 16/4 = 4 meters.So, both x and y are 4 meters. That means the base is a square with sides 4 meters each, and the height is 3 meters.Wait a second, so the tank is actually a cube? Well, not exactly, because the height is 3, but the base is 4x4. So, it's a rectangular tank with a square base.But let me verify if this is indeed a minimum. Since we have a critical point at x = 4, we should check the second derivative to ensure it's a minimum.Compute the second derivative C''(x):C''(x) = d/dx [120 - 1920/x²] = 0 + (3840)/x³So,C''(x) = 3840/x³At x = 4,C''(4) = 3840 / (4³) = 3840 / 64 = 60Since C''(4) is positive (60 > 0), the function is concave upwards at this point, which means it's a local minimum. Therefore, x = 4 is indeed the point where the cost is minimized.So, the dimensions are:Length (x) = 4 metersWidth (y) = 4 metersHeight = 3 metersNow, let's compute the minimum total cost.We can use the cost function C(x) = 640 + 120x + 1920/xSubstituting x = 4:C(4) = 640 + 120*4 + 1920/4Calculate each term:120*4 = 4801920/4 = 480So,C(4) = 640 + 480 + 480 = 640 + 960 = 1600So, the total minimum cost is 1600 yuan.Alternatively, let me verify using the original cost components.The area of the bottom is x*y = 4*4 = 16 m². So, cost for the bottom is 16 * 40 = 640 yuan.The area of the walls: two walls are 4*3 = 12 m² each, so two of them are 24 m². The other two walls are also 4*3 = 12 m² each, so another 24 m². Total wall area is 24 + 24 = 48 m². So, cost for walls is 48 * 20 = 960 yuan.Total cost: 640 + 960 = 1600 yuan. Yep, that checks out.So, the dimensions are 4 meters by 4 meters by 3 meters, and the minimum cost is 1600 yuan.I think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.We had a volume constraint, which gave us xy = 16. Then, we expressed the cost in terms of x and y, substituted y in terms of x, took the derivative, found the critical point, verified it's a minimum, and then calculated the cost. All steps seem solid, and the calculations check out. So, I feel confident with this answer.**Final Answer**The dimensions of the tank should be boxed{4} meters (length), boxed{4} meters (width), and boxed{3} meters (depth), resulting in a minimum total construction cost of boxed{1600} yuan."},{"question":"Prove that for n=6002, the sum of binomial coefficients with a step of 6, i.e., C_{6002}^{1}+C_{6002}^{7}+ldots+C_{6002}^{6001}, gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.C_{n}^{k} is the number of ways to choose k items out of n, which is frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} if 0 leqslant k leqslant n and 0 otherwise.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to prove that for n = 6002, the sum of binomial coefficients with a step of 6, specifically C(6002,1) + C(6002,7) + ... + C(6002,6001), gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.First, I remember that binomial coefficients can be related to generating functions. The generating function for binomial coefficients is (1 + x)^n. So, if I expand (1 + x)^6002, the coefficients of x^k will be C(6002, k). That makes sense.Now, the problem is asking about the sum of coefficients where k is congruent to 1 modulo 6. In other words, k = 1, 7, 13, ..., up to 6001. So, I need to find the sum S = C(6002,1) + C(6002,7) + C(6002,13) + ... + C(6002,6001). Then, I need to find S mod 3.I recall that there's a method using roots of unity to extract specific coefficients from a generating function. Maybe I can use that here. Let me try to recall how that works.The general formula for extracting coefficients where k ≡ r mod m is given by:S = (1/m) * Σ_{j=0}^{m-1} ω^{-jr} * (1 + ω^j)^nwhere ω is a primitive m-th root of unity. In this case, m = 6, and r = 1. So, ω would be a primitive 6th root of unity, which is e^(2πi/6) = e^(πi/3) = (1 + i√3)/2.So, applying this formula, S should be:S = (1/6) * [ω^{0*(-1)}*(1 + ω^0)^6002 + ω^{-1*1}*(1 + ω^1)^6002 + ω^{-2*1}*(1 + ω^2)^6002 + ω^{-3*1}*(1 + ω^3)^6002 + ω^{-4*1}*(1 + ω^4)^6002 + ω^{-5*1}*(1 + ω^5)^6002]Simplifying that, since ω^0 = 1, so (1 + ω^0)^6002 = 2^6002. Similarly, the other terms involve (1 + ω^j)^6002 multiplied by ω^{-j}.But this seems complicated because of the complex numbers involved. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute this modulo 3 without dealing with complex numbers directly.Wait, I remember Lucas' Theorem, which is useful for computing binomial coefficients modulo primes. Since 3 is a prime, maybe Lucas' Theorem can help here. Let me recall what Lucas' Theorem states.Lucas' Theorem says that for non-negative integers m and n and a prime p, the binomial coefficient C(m, n) modulo p can be determined by looking at the base-p expansions of m and n. Specifically, if m = m_k p^k + ... + m_0 and n = n_k p^k + ... + n_0, then:C(m, n) ≡ Π_{i=0}^k C(m_i, n_i) mod pwhere C(m_i, n_i) is defined to be 0 if n_i > m_i.So, maybe I can express 6002 in base 3 and then use Lucas' Theorem to compute each binomial coefficient modulo 3, and then sum them up.Let me try to convert 6002 into base 3.First, let's find the largest power of 3 less than or equal to 6002.3^0 = 13^1 = 33^2 = 93^3 = 273^4 = 813^5 = 2433^6 = 7293^7 = 21873^8 = 6561Wait, 3^8 is 6561, which is larger than 6002, so the highest power needed is 3^7 = 2187.Now, let's divide 6002 by 3^7:6002 ÷ 2187 ≈ 2.74, so the coefficient for 3^7 is 2.2 * 2187 = 4374Subtract that from 6002: 6002 - 4374 = 1628Now, 1628 ÷ 729 (which is 3^6) ≈ 2.23, so coefficient for 3^6 is 2.2 * 729 = 1458Subtract: 1628 - 1458 = 170170 ÷ 243 (3^5) is less than 1, so coefficient for 3^5 is 0.170 ÷ 81 (3^4) ≈ 2.1, so coefficient for 3^4 is 2.2 * 81 = 162Subtract: 170 - 162 = 88 ÷ 27 (3^3) is less than 1, so coefficient for 3^3 is 0.8 ÷ 9 (3^2) is less than 1, so coefficient for 3^2 is 0.8 ÷ 3 (3^1) ≈ 2.666, so coefficient for 3^1 is 2.2 * 3 = 6Subtract: 8 - 6 = 22 ÷ 1 (3^0) = 2, so coefficient for 3^0 is 2.Putting it all together, 6002 in base 3 is 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 2.Wait, let me verify that:2*(3^7) = 2*2187 = 43742*(3^6) = 2*729 = 14580*(3^5) = 02*(3^4) = 2*81 = 1620*(3^3) = 00*(3^2) = 02*(3^1) = 62*(3^0) = 2Adding these up: 4374 + 1458 = 5832; 5832 + 162 = 6000; 6000 + 6 = 6006; 6006 + 2 = 6008. Wait, that's not 6002. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the coefficients.Let me try again.Starting with 6002:6002 ÷ 2187 = 2, remainder 6002 - 2*2187 = 6002 - 4374 = 16281628 ÷ 729 = 2, remainder 1628 - 2*729 = 1628 - 1458 = 170170 ÷ 243 = 0, remainder 170170 ÷ 81 = 2, remainder 170 - 2*81 = 170 - 162 = 88 ÷ 27 = 0, remainder 88 ÷ 9 = 0, remainder 88 ÷ 3 = 2, remainder 8 - 2*3 = 22 ÷ 1 = 2, remainder 0So, the base-3 digits are: 2 (for 3^7), 2 (for 3^6), 0 (for 3^5), 2 (for 3^4), 0 (for 3^3), 0 (for 3^2), 2 (for 3^1), 2 (for 3^0). So, 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 2.But when I add them up, as before, it's 2*2187 + 2*729 + 0*243 + 2*81 + 0*27 + 0*9 + 2*3 + 2*1 = 4374 + 1458 + 0 + 162 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 2 = 4374 + 1458 = 5832; 5832 + 162 = 6000; 6000 + 6 = 6006; 6006 + 2 = 6008. Hmm, that's 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. So, I must have made an error in the coefficients.Wait, maybe I messed up the division steps. Let me try a different approach.Let me compute 3^0 = 13^1 = 33^2 = 93^3 = 273^4 = 813^5 = 2433^6 = 7293^7 = 21873^8 = 6561So, 3^8 is 6561, which is larger than 6002, so the highest power is 3^7=2187.6002 ÷ 2187 = 2, remainder 6002 - 2*2187 = 6002 - 4374 = 1628.1628 ÷ 729 = 2, remainder 1628 - 2*729 = 1628 - 1458 = 170.170 ÷ 243 = 0, remainder 170.170 ÷ 81 = 2, remainder 170 - 2*81 = 170 - 162 = 8.8 ÷ 27 = 0, remainder 8.8 ÷ 9 = 0, remainder 8.8 ÷ 3 = 2, remainder 8 - 2*3 = 2.2 ÷ 1 = 2, remainder 0.So, the base-3 digits are: 2 (for 3^7), 2 (for 3^6), 0 (for 3^5), 2 (for 3^4), 0 (for 3^3), 0 (for 3^2), 2 (for 3^1), 2 (for 3^0). So, 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 2.But as before, adding up the contributions: 2*2187 + 2*729 + 0*243 + 2*81 + 0*27 + 0*9 + 2*3 + 2*1 = 4374 + 1458 + 0 + 162 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 2 = 4374 + 1458 = 5832; 5832 + 162 = 6000; 6000 + 6 = 6006; 6006 + 2 = 6008. Hmm, that's still 6008. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial division.Wait, 2*2187 is 4374, correct. 6002 - 4374 is 1628, correct. 1628 ÷ 729 is 2, remainder 170, correct. 170 ÷ 81 is 2, remainder 8, correct. 8 ÷ 3 is 2, remainder 2, correct. So, the base-3 digits are correct, but when we add them up, it's 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. That suggests that maybe I made a mistake in the coefficients somewhere.Wait, perhaps I should check the coefficients again. Let me compute 2*2187 + 2*729 + 0*243 + 2*81 + 0*27 + 0*9 + 2*3 + 2*1.2*2187 = 43742*729 = 14580*243 = 02*81 = 1620*27 = 00*9 = 02*3 = 62*1 = 2Adding these: 4374 + 1458 = 5832; 5832 + 162 = 6000; 6000 + 6 = 6006; 6006 + 2 = 6008.Hmm, that's 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the base-3 expansion. Maybe the coefficients are different.Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me compute 6002 ÷ 3 repeatedly.6002 ÷ 3 = 2000 with a remainder of 2.2000 ÷ 3 = 666 with a remainder of 2.666 ÷ 3 = 222 with a remainder of 0.222 ÷ 3 = 74 with a remainder of 0.74 ÷ 3 = 24 with a remainder of 2.24 ÷ 3 = 8 with a remainder of 0.8 ÷ 3 = 2 with a remainder of 2.2 ÷ 3 = 0 with a remainder of 2.So, writing the remainders from last to first: 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2.Wait, that's the same as before: 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 2. So, that's correct. So, 6002 in base 3 is 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 2, which is 2*3^7 + 2*3^6 + 0*3^5 + 2*3^4 + 0*3^3 + 0*3^2 + 2*3^1 + 2*3^0.But when I compute that, it's 2*2187 + 2*729 + 0*243 + 2*81 + 0*27 + 0*9 + 2*3 + 2*1 = 4374 + 1458 + 0 + 162 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 2 = 6008. Hmm, that's 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, 2*2187 is 4374, correct. 2*729 is 1458, correct. 0*243 is 0. 2*81 is 162. 0*27 is 0. 0*9 is 0. 2*3 is 6. 2*1 is 2. So, 4374 + 1458 = 5832. 5832 + 162 = 6000. 6000 + 6 = 6006. 6006 + 2 = 6008. So, that's 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. So, perhaps the base-3 expansion is incorrect.Wait, maybe I should check the initial division steps again.6002 ÷ 3: 3*2000 = 6000, so remainder 2.2000 ÷ 3: 3*666 = 1998, remainder 2.666 ÷ 3: 3*222 = 666, remainder 0.222 ÷ 3: 3*74 = 222, remainder 0.74 ÷ 3: 3*24 = 72, remainder 2.24 ÷ 3: 3*8 = 24, remainder 0.8 ÷ 3: 3*2 = 6, remainder 2.2 ÷ 3: 0, remainder 2.So, the remainders are: 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2.So, the base-3 digits are indeed 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 2.Wait, but when I compute the value, it's 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, 2*3^7 = 2*2187 = 43742*3^6 = 2*729 = 14580*3^5 = 02*3^4 = 2*81 = 1620*3^3 = 00*3^2 = 02*3^1 = 62*3^0 = 2Adding these: 4374 + 1458 = 5832; 5832 + 162 = 6000; 6000 + 6 = 6006; 6006 + 2 = 6008.Hmm, that's 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. So, perhaps the base-3 expansion is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial division.Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me compute 3^7 = 2187. 2187 * 2 = 4374. 6002 - 4374 = 1628.1628 ÷ 729 = 2, since 729*2 = 1458. 1628 - 1458 = 170.170 ÷ 81 = 2, since 81*2 = 162. 170 - 162 = 8.8 ÷ 3 = 2, since 3*2 = 6. 8 - 6 = 2.So, the coefficients are: 2 (for 3^7), 2 (for 3^6), 0 (for 3^5), 2 (for 3^4), 0 (for 3^3), 0 (for 3^2), 2 (for 3^1), 2 (for 3^0).So, that's correct. So, 6002 in base 3 is 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 2.But when I compute the value, it's 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, 2*3^7 = 2*2187 = 43742*3^6 = 2*729 = 14580*3^5 = 02*3^4 = 2*81 = 1620*3^3 = 00*3^2 = 02*3^1 = 62*3^0 = 2Adding up: 4374 + 1458 = 5832; 5832 + 162 = 6000; 6000 + 6 = 6006; 6006 + 2 = 6008.Wait, that's 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the base-3 expansion.Wait, maybe I should check 3^7 + 3^6 + ... Let me compute 3^7 + 3^6 = 2187 + 729 = 2916. 2916*2 = 5832. 5832 + 162 = 6000. 6000 + 6 = 6006. 6006 + 2 = 6008. So, yeah, that's 6008. So, perhaps the base-3 expansion is incorrect.Wait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let me compute 6002 ÷ 3^7 = 6002 ÷ 2187 ≈ 2.74, so the coefficient is 2, remainder 6002 - 2*2187 = 6002 - 4374 = 1628.1628 ÷ 3^6 = 1628 ÷ 729 ≈ 2.23, so coefficient is 2, remainder 1628 - 2*729 = 1628 - 1458 = 170.170 ÷ 3^5 = 170 ÷ 243 ≈ 0.7, so coefficient is 0, remainder 170.170 ÷ 3^4 = 170 ÷ 81 ≈ 2.1, so coefficient is 2, remainder 170 - 2*81 = 170 - 162 = 8.8 ÷ 3^3 = 8 ÷ 27 ≈ 0.296, so coefficient is 0, remainder 8.8 ÷ 3^2 = 8 ÷ 9 ≈ 0.888, so coefficient is 0, remainder 8.8 ÷ 3^1 = 8 ÷ 3 ≈ 2.666, so coefficient is 2, remainder 8 - 2*3 = 2.2 ÷ 3^0 = 2, so coefficient is 2.So, the base-3 digits are: 2 (3^7), 2 (3^6), 0 (3^5), 2 (3^4), 0 (3^3), 0 (3^2), 2 (3^1), 2 (3^0). So, that's 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 2.But when I compute the value, it's 2*2187 + 2*729 + 0*243 + 2*81 + 0*27 + 0*9 + 2*3 + 2*1 = 4374 + 1458 + 0 + 162 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 2 = 6008. So, that's 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial division.Wait, maybe I should check if 6002 is actually 6008 - 6, so perhaps the base-3 expansion is correct, but I'm adding the digits incorrectly.Wait, 2*3^7 = 2*2187 = 43742*3^6 = 2*729 = 14580*3^5 = 02*3^4 = 2*81 = 1620*3^3 = 00*3^2 = 02*3^1 = 62*3^0 = 2Adding up: 4374 + 1458 = 5832; 5832 + 162 = 6000; 6000 + 6 = 6006; 6006 + 2 = 6008.Wait, that's correct. So, 6002 in base 3 is 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 2, but when converted back, it's 6008. That suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, or there's a mistake in the process.Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Maybe instead of using Lucas' Theorem directly, I can use generating functions modulo 3.Let me consider the generating function (1 + x)^6002. I need the sum of coefficients where the exponent is ≡1 mod 6. So, that's the same as the sum of coefficients where k ≡1 mod 6.I can use the roots of unity filter for modulus 6. The formula is:S = (1/6) * Σ_{j=0}^{5} ω^{-j} * (1 + ω^j)^6002where ω is a primitive 6th root of unity.But since we're working modulo 3, perhaps we can simplify this expression.Wait, 6 is not a prime, but 3 is a prime. Maybe I can use properties of exponents modulo 3.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (1 + x)^6002 modulo 3, and then evaluate it at the 6th roots of unity modulo 3.Wait, but 6th roots of unity modulo 3 might not exist, since 3 is a prime. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that (1 + x)^6002 ≡ (1 + x^2)^{something} modulo 3, due to Fermat's little theorem.Wait, Fermat's little theorem says that for a prime p, (1 + x)^p ≡ 1 + x^p mod p. So, perhaps I can use that to simplify (1 + x)^6002 mod 3.Let me try to compute 6002 in base 3, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, earlier I saw that 6002 in base 3 is 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 2, but that sums to 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. So, perhaps I should adjust the coefficients.Wait, maybe I should try to compute 6002 ÷ 3^7 = 6002 ÷ 2187 = 2 with remainder 6002 - 2*2187 = 1628.1628 ÷ 3^6 = 1628 ÷ 729 = 2 with remainder 1628 - 2*729 = 170.170 ÷ 3^5 = 170 ÷ 243 = 0 with remainder 170.170 ÷ 3^4 = 170 ÷ 81 = 2 with remainder 170 - 2*81 = 8.8 ÷ 3^3 = 8 ÷ 27 = 0 with remainder 8.8 ÷ 3^2 = 8 ÷ 9 = 0 with remainder 8.8 ÷ 3^1 = 8 ÷ 3 = 2 with remainder 8 - 2*3 = 2.2 ÷ 3^0 = 2 with remainder 0.So, the base-3 digits are: 2 (3^7), 2 (3^6), 0 (3^5), 2 (3^4), 0 (3^3), 0 (3^2), 2 (3^1), 2 (3^0). So, 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 2.But when I compute the value, it's 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial division.Wait, perhaps I should check 3^7 = 2187, 2*2187 = 4374. 6002 - 4374 = 1628.1628 ÷ 729 = 2, 2*729 = 1458, 1628 - 1458 = 170.170 ÷ 81 = 2, 2*81 = 162, 170 - 162 = 8.8 ÷ 3 = 2, 2*3 = 6, 8 - 6 = 2.So, the coefficients are correct, but the total is 6008, which is 6 more than 6002. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem statement.Wait, the problem says n = 6002, but perhaps it's supposed to be n = 6000 or another number. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the base-3 expansion.Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without worrying about the base-3 expansion and instead use generating functions modulo 3.So, let's consider (1 + x)^6002 mod 3. Since 3 is prime, by Fermat's little theorem, (1 + x)^3 ≡ 1 + x^3 mod 3.So, (1 + x)^6002 = [(1 + x)^3]^2000 * (1 + x)^2.Since (1 + x)^3 ≡ 1 + x^3 mod 3, then [(1 + x)^3]^2000 ≡ (1 + x^3)^2000 mod 3.Similarly, (1 + x)^2 is just 1 + 2x + x^2.So, (1 + x)^6002 ≡ (1 + x^3)^2000 * (1 + 2x + x^2) mod 3.Now, let's compute (1 + x^3)^2000 mod 3. Again, using Fermat's little theorem, since 3 is prime, (1 + x^3)^3 ≡ 1 + x^9 mod 3.But 2000 divided by 3 is 666 with a remainder of 2, so (1 + x^3)^2000 ≡ [(1 + x^3)^3]^666 * (1 + x^3)^2 ≡ (1 + x^9)^666 * (1 + 2x^3 + x^6) mod 3.But this seems to be getting more complicated. Maybe there's a pattern or a simpler way.Alternatively, perhaps I can note that (1 + x)^6002 mod 3 is equivalent to (1 + x)^{6002 mod (3-1)} because of the exponent cycling modulo (p-1) due to Fermat's little theorem. Wait, 3-1=2, so 6002 mod 2 is 0, so (1 + x)^6002 ≡ (1 + x)^0 ≡ 1 mod 3? That can't be right because (1 + x)^2 ≡ 1 + 2x + x^2 mod 3, which isn't 1.Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me consider that (1 + x)^{3k} ≡ 1 + x^{3k} mod 3. So, perhaps I can write 6002 as 3k + r, where r is 0, 1, or 2.6002 ÷ 3 = 2000 with a remainder of 2, so 6002 = 3*2000 + 2. So, (1 + x)^6002 ≡ (1 + x)^{3*2000 + 2} ≡ [(1 + x)^3]^{2000} * (1 + x)^2 ≡ (1 + x^3)^{2000} * (1 + 2x + x^2) mod 3.Now, let's compute (1 + x^3)^{2000} mod 3. Again, using Fermat's little theorem, (1 + x^3)^3 ≡ 1 + x^9 mod 3. So, 2000 divided by 3 is 666 with a remainder of 2, so (1 + x^3)^{2000} ≡ [(1 + x^3)^3]^{666} * (1 + x^3)^2 ≡ (1 + x^9)^{666} * (1 + 2x^3 + x^6) mod 3.But this seems to be getting more complicated. Maybe I can notice a pattern.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that (1 + x)^{3k} ≡ 1 + x^{3k} mod 3, so (1 + x)^{3*2000} ≡ 1 + x^{6000} mod 3. Then, multiplying by (1 + x)^2, we get (1 + x^{6000}) * (1 + 2x + x^2) mod 3.Expanding this, we get 1*(1 + 2x + x^2) + x^{6000}*(1 + 2x + x^2) = 1 + 2x + x^2 + x^{6000} + 2x^{6001} + x^{6002} mod 3.So, (1 + x)^6002 ≡ 1 + 2x + x^2 + x^{6000} + 2x^{6001} + x^{6002} mod 3.Now, I need to find the sum of coefficients where the exponent is ≡1 mod 6. So, in the expansion of (1 + x)^6002 mod 3, the coefficients of x^k where k ≡1 mod 6 are the terms we're interested in.Looking at the expression above, the terms are:1 (x^0), 2x (x^1), x^2, x^{6000}, 2x^{6001}, x^{6002}.So, the coefficients for x^1 is 2, and for x^{6001} is 2. All other terms have exponents not congruent to 1 mod 6.Wait, but 6001 mod 6: 6000 is divisible by 6, so 6000 ≡0 mod 6, so 6001 ≡1 mod 6. Similarly, 6002 ≡2 mod 6.So, in the expansion, the coefficients for x^1 and x^{6001} are 2 each. All other exponents are either 0, 2, 6000, 6002 mod 6, which are 0, 2, 0, 2 respectively.So, the sum S is 2 + 2 = 4 mod 3, which is 1 mod 3.Wait, that's the result we wanted! So, the sum S ≡1 mod 3.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other terms. The expansion only has terms at x^0, x^1, x^2, x^{6000}, x^{6001}, x^{6002}. So, the only exponents congruent to 1 mod 6 are x^1 and x^{6001}, each with coefficient 2. So, 2 + 2 = 4, which is 1 mod 3.Therefore, the sum S ≡1 mod 3.So, that's the proof. I think this approach using generating functions modulo 3 and Fermat's little theorem works."},{"question":"Find a number which, when increased by one-fifth of itself and then by one more, gives 10.","answer":"First, I'll define the unknown number as ( x ).The problem states that when this number is increased by one-fifth of itself and then by one more, the result is 10. This can be translated into the equation:[ x + frac{1}{5}x + 1 = 10 ]Next, I'll combine like terms by adding ( x ) and ( frac{1}{5}x ), which gives:[ frac{6}{5}x + 1 = 10 ]To isolate ( x ), I'll subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:[ frac{6}{5}x = 9 ]Finally, I'll solve for ( x ) by multiplying both sides by ( frac{5}{6} ):[ x = 9 times frac{5}{6} = frac{15}{2} ]"},{"question":"How many different ways can 7 identical balls be placed into four different boxes, with each box containing at least one ball?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: I need to figure out how many different ways I can place 7 identical balls into four different boxes, and each box has to have at least one ball. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First off, the balls are identical, which means that the order in which they're placed into the boxes doesn't matter. It's just about how many balls end up in each box. The boxes, on the other hand, are different, so which box has how many balls does matter.Since each box must have at least one ball, I can't have any box empty. That adds a constraint to the problem. If there were no constraints, the number of ways would be different, but since each box needs at least one, I have to adjust for that.I remember something about combinations with constraints. Maybe it's related to the stars and bars theorem? Let me recall. The stars and bars theorem is used to find the number of ways to distribute identical objects into distinct bins. The formula is usually something like C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where n is the number of objects and k is the number of bins. But that's when bins can be empty. Since in this case, each box must have at least one ball, I think we have to adjust the formula.Right, if each box must have at least one ball, we can subtract one ball from each box first to ensure that condition. So, if I have 7 balls and 4 boxes, each needing at least one, I can imagine placing one ball in each box first. That uses up 4 balls, leaving me with 3 balls to distribute freely among the 4 boxes. Now, since the remaining 3 balls can go into any box, including multiple in the same box, this becomes a problem of distributing 3 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes, where boxes can be empty.So, applying the stars and bars theorem here, the number of ways should be C(3 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) which is C(6, 3). Let me calculate that. C(6, 3) is 20. So, does that mean there are 20 ways?Wait, let me make sure. So, the initial step was to place one ball in each box, which uses up 4 balls, leaving 3. Then, distributing those 3 balls into 4 boxes with no restrictions. So, yes, that should be C(3 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(6, 3) = 20. That seems right.But just to double-check, maybe I can think of it another way. The problem is similar to finding the number of integer solutions to the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 7, where each xi >= 1. If I let yi = xi - 1, then each yi >= 0, and the equation becomes y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 = 3. The number of non-negative integer solutions to this is C(3 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(6, 3) = 20. Yep, same result.Alternatively, I can think of it as arranging stars and bars. The 3 remaining balls are stars, and the dividers between boxes are bars. Since there are 4 boxes, we need 3 bars to separate them. So, the total number of symbols is 3 stars + 3 bars = 6 symbols. The number of ways to arrange these is 6 choose 3, which is 20. That matches as well.Wait, another thought: sometimes when I see these problems, the formula is presented as C(n - 1, k - 1) when each box must have at least one ball. So, in this case, n is 7, k is 4, so it would be C(7 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(6, 3) = 20. So that's consistent too.Just to make sure, maybe I can list out some possibilities for a smaller number and see if the logic holds. Let's say instead of 7 balls and 4 boxes, I have 3 balls and 2 boxes, each with at least one ball. According to the formula, it should be C(3 - 1, 2 - 1) = C(2, 1) = 2. Let's list them: (1,2) and (2,1). Yep, that's 2 ways, which matches. So the formula works for that case.Another test case: 4 balls into 3 boxes, each with at least one. The formula gives C(4 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3. The possible distributions are (1,1,2), (1,2,1), and (2,1,1). That's 3, which is correct. So, the formula seems reliable.Therefore, going back to the original problem, 7 balls into 4 boxes with each box having at least one ball, the number of ways is 20.Wait, hold on, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. So, if I have 7 balls, and I place 1 in each box, that's 4 balls, leaving 3. So, distributing 3 indistinct balls into 4 distinct boxes, which is C(3 + 4 -1, 4 -1) = C(6,3). That is 20. So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, if I didn't adjust for the minimum of 1 ball per box, the number of ways would be C(7 + 4 -1, 4 -1) = C(10,3) = 120. But that's without the restriction. So, with the restriction, it's 20, which is much less, which makes sense because we're restricting the problem.So, in summary, the number of ways is 20.**Final Answer**The number of different ways is boxed{20}."},{"question":"Sasha wrote on the board all two-digit numbers divisible by 6 and then erased those that do not end in 4.

I need to convert this into a standard Cartesian equation for part (I). Hmm, I remember that converting polar equations to Cartesian involves using the relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates. Let me recall: ρ² = x² + y², x = ρ cosθ, y = ρ sinθ. Also, there's the identity for cos(θ - π/4), which can be expanded using the cosine difference formula.So, first, let's write down the given equation:ρ² - 4√2 ρ cos(θ - π/4) + 6 = 0.I need to expand the cos(θ - π/4) term. The cosine difference formula is:cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB.So, applying this to cos(θ - π/4):cosθ cos(π/4) + sinθ sin(π/4).I know that cos(π/4) and sin(π/4) are both √2/2. So, substituting:cosθ*(√2/2) + sinθ*(√2/2) = (√2/2)(cosθ + sinθ).Therefore, the equation becomes:ρ² - 4√2 ρ*(√2/2)(cosθ + sinθ) + 6 = 0.Simplify the coefficients:4√2 * (√2/2) = 4*(2)/2 = 4.So, the equation simplifies to:ρ² - 4ρ(cosθ + sinθ) + 6 = 0.Now, let's substitute ρ² with x² + y², and ρ cosθ with x, and ρ sinθ with y.So, substituting:x² + y² - 4(x + y) + 6 = 0.That's a Cartesian equation, but it's not in standard form. The standard form of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r². So, I need to complete the squares for x and y.Let me rewrite the equation:x² - 4x + y² - 4y + 6 = 0.Group the x terms and y terms:(x² - 4x) + (y² - 4y) + 6 = 0.Now, complete the square for x:x² - 4x. Take half of -4, which is -2, square it: 4. So, add and subtract 4.Similarly, for y² - 4y: half of -4 is -2, square it: 4. Add and subtract 4.So, the equation becomes:(x² - 4x + 4 - 4) + (y² - 4y + 4 - 4) + 6 = 0.Which simplifies to:[(x - 2)² - 4] + [(y - 2)² - 4] + 6 = 0.Combine constants:(x - 2)² + (y - 2)² - 4 - 4 + 6 = 0.Simplify:(x - 2)² + (y - 2)² - 2 = 0.Bring the constant to the other side:(x - 2)² + (y - 2)² = 2.So, that's the standard Cartesian equation. The circle is centered at (2, 2) with radius √2.Alright, that was part (I). Now, moving on to part (II): If a point P(x, y) lies on this circle, find the maximum and minimum values of x + y.Hmm, so we need to find the maximum and minimum of x + y for points on the circle (x - 2)² + (y - 2)² = 2.I remember that for a function f(x, y) = x + y on a circle, the extrema can be found using the method of Lagrange multipliers, or by recognizing that x + y is a linear function, so its extrema on a circle will occur at points where the gradient of f is parallel to the gradient of the circle's equation.Alternatively, since x + y is a straight line, the maximum and minimum values on the circle will be the points where this line is tangent to the circle. The maximum value is the distance from the center to the line plus the radius, and the minimum is the distance minus the radius, but scaled appropriately.Wait, actually, more accurately, the maximum and minimum of x + y on the circle can be found by considering the dot product of the vector (1,1) with points on the circle. The maximum and minimum will be the center's value plus and minus the radius times the norm of (1,1).Let me think. Let me denote f(x, y) = x + y. The maximum and minimum of f on the circle can be found by:f_max = f(center) + radius * ||grad f|| / ||grad f||?Wait, no, more precisely, the maximum value is f(center) + radius * ||grad f||, but normalized.Wait, actually, the maximum of f(x, y) on the circle is equal to f(center) plus the radius times the norm of the direction vector of f.Wait, let me recall. The function f(x, y) = x + y can be thought of as a linear function, and its extrema on the circle occur at points where the gradient of f is parallel to the gradient of the circle's equation.The gradient of f is (1, 1). The gradient of the circle's equation is (2(x - 2), 2(y - 2)). So, setting them parallel:(1, 1) = λ*(2(x - 2), 2(y - 2)).So, 1 = 2λ(x - 2) and 1 = 2λ(y - 2). Therefore, x - 2 = y - 2, so x = y.So, the points where the extrema occur lie along the line x = y. So, substituting x = y into the circle equation:(x - 2)² + (x - 2)² = 2.So, 2(x - 2)² = 2 => (x - 2)² = 1 => x - 2 = ±1 => x = 3 or x = 1.Therefore, the points are (3, 3) and (1, 1). So, evaluating f(x, y) = x + y at these points:At (3, 3): 3 + 3 = 6.At (1, 1): 1 + 1 = 2.Therefore, the maximum value of x + y is 6, and the minimum is 2.Alternatively, another method is to parametrize the circle and express x + y in terms of the parameter, then find the maximum and minimum.Let me try that as a check.The circle is (x - 2)² + (y - 2)² = 2. So, parametrizing with θ:x = 2 + √2 cosθ,y = 2 + √2 sinθ.Then, x + y = 2 + √2 cosθ + 2 + √2 sinθ = 4 + √2 (cosθ + sinθ).We can write cosθ + sinθ as √2 sin(θ + π/4). Because cosθ + sinθ = √2 sin(θ + π/4). So,x + y = 4 + √2*(√2 sin(θ + π/4)) = 4 + 2 sin(θ + π/4).The maximum value of sin is 1, so maximum x + y is 4 + 2*1 = 6.The minimum value of sin is -1, so minimum x + y is 4 + 2*(-1) = 2.So, same result. So, that confirms the maximum is 6 and the minimum is 2.Alternatively, using vectors: The function x + y can be represented as the dot product of (x, y) with (1, 1). The maximum value of this dot product on the circle is the magnitude of (1, 1) times the magnitude of the vector from the center, plus the dot product of the center with (1, 1). Wait, maybe I should think differently.Wait, the center is (2, 2). So, the vector from the origin to the center is (2, 2). The function x + y is the dot product of (x, y) with (1, 1). So, to find the maximum and minimum of x + y on the circle, we can consider that the maximum occurs when the vector (x, y) is in the direction of (1, 1) from the center, and the minimum in the opposite direction.But the circle is centered at (2, 2) with radius √2. So, the maximum value of x + y is (2 + 2) + √2*(1 + 1)/√(1² + 1²). Wait, let me think.Wait, the maximum of x + y on the circle is equal to the value at the center plus the radius times the norm of (1,1). Wait, no, more precisely, the maximum is f(center) + radius * ||grad f|| / ||grad f||? Hmm, maybe not.Wait, actually, the maximum of x + y on the circle is equal to the value at the center plus the radius times the norm of the direction vector (1,1). Wait, let me recall the formula.For a function f(x, y) = ax + by + c, the maximum on a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is f(h, k) + r*sqrt(a² + b²). Similarly, the minimum is f(h, k) - r*sqrt(a² + b²).Wait, in our case, f(x, y) = x + y, so a = 1, b = 1. The center is (2, 2). So, f(center) = 2 + 2 = 4. The radius is √2. So, sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(1 + 1) = √2.Therefore, maximum f = 4 + √2 * √2 = 4 + 2 = 6.Minimum f = 4 - √2 * √2 = 4 - 2 = 2.So, that's another way to see it. So, this confirms the earlier results.Therefore, the maximum value of x + y is 6, and the minimum is 2.So, summarizing:(I) The standard Cartesian equation is (x - 2)² + (y - 2)² = 2.(II) The maximum value of x + y is 6, and the minimum is 2.**Final Answer**(I) The standard Cartesian equation is boxed{(x - 2)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 2}.(II) The maximum value of (x + y) is boxed{6} and the minimum value is boxed{2}."},{"question":"In a physical fitness sampling conducted by a school, 160 students are to be selected from three high school grades.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, if two quadratic equations have a common zero, that means there exists some value ( x = alpha ) such that both equations equal zero when ( x = alpha ). So, plugging ( alpha ) into both equations should satisfy them. Let me write that down.Let ( alpha ) be the common zero. Then,1. ( 1988alpha^2 + kalpha + 8891 = 0 )  ...(1)2. ( 8891alpha^2 + kalpha + 1988 = 0 )  ...(2)Okay, so now I have two equations with two variables: ( k ) and ( alpha ). I need to solve for ( k ), so maybe I can eliminate ( alpha ) somehow.Let me subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to see if that helps. Subtracting (2) from (1):( (1988alpha^2 + kalpha + 8891) - (8891alpha^2 + kalpha + 1988) = 0 - 0 )Simplify this:( 1988alpha^2 - 8891alpha^2 + kalpha - kalpha + 8891 - 1988 = 0 )Simplify term by term:- ( 1988alpha^2 - 8891alpha^2 = (1988 - 8891)alpha^2 = (-6903)alpha^2 )- ( kalpha - kalpha = 0 )- ( 8891 - 1988 = 6903 )So putting it all together:( -6903alpha^2 + 6903 = 0 )Factor out 6903:( 6903(-alpha^2 + 1) = 0 )Since 6903 is not zero, we can divide both sides by 6903:( -alpha^2 + 1 = 0 )Which simplifies to:( alpha^2 = 1 )So, ( alpha = 1 ) or ( alpha = -1 ). Okay, so the common zero must be either 1 or -1. That narrows it down.Now, let's plug these values back into one of the original equations to solve for ( k ). Let me choose equation (1) for both cases.Case 1: ( alpha = 1 )Plugging into equation (1):( 1988(1)^2 + k(1) + 8891 = 0 )Simplify:( 1988 + k + 8891 = 0 )Combine constants:( 1988 + 8891 = 10879 )So:( 10879 + k = 0 )Therefore:( k = -10879 )Case 2: ( alpha = -1 )Plugging into equation (1):( 1988(-1)^2 + k(-1) + 8891 = 0 )Simplify:( 1988(1) - k + 8891 = 0 )Which is:( 1988 - k + 8891 = 0 )Combine constants:( 1988 + 8891 = 10879 )So:( 10879 - k = 0 )Therefore:( k = 10879 )So, the two possible values of ( k ) are ( 10879 ) and ( -10879 ). Hmm, let me verify if these are correct.Let me check ( k = 10879 ) with both quadratics.First quadratic: ( 1988x^2 + 10879x + 8891 )If ( x = -1 ):( 1988(1) + 10879(-1) + 8891 = 1988 - 10879 + 8891 )Calculate:1988 + 8891 = 1087910879 - 10879 = 0. Okay, that works.Second quadratic: ( 8891x^2 + 10879x + 1988 )If ( x = -1 ):( 8891(1) + 10879(-1) + 1988 = 8891 - 10879 + 1988 )Again, 8891 + 1988 = 1087910879 - 10879 = 0. Perfect.Now, check ( k = -10879 ) with both quadratics.First quadratic: ( 1988x^2 - 10879x + 8891 )If ( x = 1 ):( 1988(1) - 10879(1) + 8891 = 1988 - 10879 + 8891 )Again, 1988 + 8891 = 1087910879 - 10879 = 0. Good.Second quadratic: ( 8891x^2 - 10879x + 1988 )If ( x = 1 ):( 8891(1) - 10879(1) + 1988 = 8891 - 10879 + 1988 )Same as before, 8891 + 1988 = 1087910879 - 10879 = 0. Perfect.So both values of ( k ) work. Therefore, the real values of ( k ) are ( 10879 ) and ( -10879 ).Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\"for what real values of ( k )\\", so both are valid. But just to make sure, let me check if these quadratics actually have real roots when ( k ) is 10879 or -10879.For the first quadratic, discriminant ( D = k^2 - 4 times 1988 times 8891 ).Compute discriminant for ( k = 10879 ):( D = (10879)^2 - 4 times 1988 times 8891 )Wait, is this positive? Let me compute.First, ( 10879^2 ). Let me compute 10879 squared.But wait, 10879 is equal to 1988 + 8891, right? 1988 + 8891 = 10879.So, ( (1988 + 8891)^2 = 1988^2 + 2 times 1988 times 8891 + 8891^2 )So, ( D = (1988 + 8891)^2 - 4 times 1988 times 8891 )Simplify:( D = 1988^2 + 2 times 1988 times 8891 + 8891^2 - 4 times 1988 times 8891 )Combine like terms:( D = 1988^2 - 2 times 1988 times 8891 + 8891^2 )Which is ( (1988 - 8891)^2 )Compute ( 1988 - 8891 = -6903 ), so ( (-6903)^2 = 6903^2 ), which is positive. So discriminant is positive, so real roots exist.Similarly, for ( k = -10879 ), discriminant is same because ( k^2 ) is same as ( (10879)^2 ). So discriminant is same, positive. So both quadratics have real roots in both cases.Therefore, both ( k = 10879 ) and ( k = -10879 ) are valid solutions.Wait, but just to make sure, is there any other possible common zero? We found that ( alpha^2 = 1 ), so only 1 and -1. So, only these two possibilities. Therefore, only these two values of ( k ).So, I think that's all. So, the real values of ( k ) are ( 10879 ) and ( -10879 ).**Final Answer**The real values of ( k ) are boxed{10879} and boxed{-10879}."},{"question":"Aston has accidentally torn apart his comics and needs to put all the pages back together.

What is the perimeter of the polygon, in units?","answer":"First, I recognize that the measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon is related to the number of sides. The formula for the measure of an exterior angle is 360 degrees divided by the number of sides (n).Given that each exterior angle is 120 degrees, I can set up the equation 360/n = 120. Solving for n, I multiply both sides by n to get 360 = 120n, and then divide both sides by 120 to find that n = 3. This means the polygon is a triangle.Since each side of the polygon is 5 units long, the perimeter is the number of sides multiplied by the length of one side. Therefore, the perimeter is 3 * 5 = 15 units."},{"question":"Find the limit of the sumS_{n} = frac{3}{4} + frac{5}{36} + ldots + frac{2n + 1}{n^2 (n + 1)^2}as ( n to infty ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the limit of the sum ( S_n = frac{3}{4} + frac{5}{36} + ldots + frac{2n + 1}{n^2 (n + 1)^2} ) as ( n ) approaches infinity. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I notice that each term in the sum has the form ( frac{2k + 1}{k^2 (k + 1)^2} ) where ( k ) starts from 1 and goes up to ( n ). So, the general term is ( frac{2k + 1}{k^2 (k + 1)^2} ). I need to find the sum of these terms from ( k = 1 ) to ( k = n ) and then take the limit as ( n ) becomes very large.I remember that sometimes when dealing with sums like this, it's helpful to see if the term can be expressed as a telescoping series. A telescoping series is one where most terms cancel out when you write out the partial sums, leaving only a few terms that are easy to compute. So, maybe I can try to decompose the general term into partial fractions.Let me try to express ( frac{2k + 1}{k^2 (k + 1)^2} ) as a combination of simpler fractions. Let's assume that it can be written as:[frac{2k + 1}{k^2 (k + 1)^2} = frac{A}{k} + frac{B}{k^2} + frac{C}{k + 1} + frac{D}{(k + 1)^2}]Where ( A ), ( B ), ( C ), and ( D ) are constants that I need to find. To find these constants, I'll multiply both sides by ( k^2 (k + 1)^2 ) to eliminate the denominators:[2k + 1 = A k (k + 1)^2 + B (k + 1)^2 + C k^2 (k + 1) + D k^2]Now, I need to expand the right-hand side and then collect like terms to compare coefficients on both sides.First, let's expand each term on the right:1. ( A k (k + 1)^2 ):   - ( (k + 1)^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 )   - So, ( A k (k^2 + 2k + 1) = A k^3 + 2A k^2 + A k )2. ( B (k + 1)^2 ):   - ( B (k^2 + 2k + 1) = B k^2 + 2B k + B )3. ( C k^2 (k + 1) ):   - ( C k^2 (k + 1) = C k^3 + C k^2 )4. ( D k^2 ):   - That's just ( D k^2 )Now, let's combine all these terms:- Cubic terms: ( A k^3 + C k^3 = (A + C) k^3 )- Quadratic terms: ( 2A k^2 + B k^2 + C k^2 + D k^2 = (2A + B + C + D) k^2 )- Linear terms: ( A k + 2B k = (A + 2B) k )- Constant term: ( B )So, putting it all together, the right-hand side is:[(A + C) k^3 + (2A + B + C + D) k^2 + (A + 2B) k + B]Now, this must equal the left-hand side, which is ( 2k + 1 ). So, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of ( k ):1. For ( k^3 ): ( A + C = 0 ) (since there's no ( k^3 ) term on the left)2. For ( k^2 ): ( 2A + B + C + D = 0 ) (no ( k^2 ) term on the left)3. For ( k ): ( A + 2B = 2 ) (coefficient of ( k ) on the left is 2)4. For the constant term: ( B = 1 ) (constant term on the left is 1)Now, let's solve these equations step by step.From equation 4: ( B = 1 )Plugging ( B = 1 ) into equation 3: ( A + 2(1) = 2 ) => ( A + 2 = 2 ) => ( A = 0 )From equation 1: ( A + C = 0 ) => ( 0 + C = 0 ) => ( C = 0 )Now, plug ( A = 0 ), ( B = 1 ), and ( C = 0 ) into equation 2:( 2(0) + 1 + 0 + D = 0 ) => ( 0 + 1 + 0 + D = 0 ) => ( 1 + D = 0 ) => ( D = -1 )So, we have ( A = 0 ), ( B = 1 ), ( C = 0 ), and ( D = -1 ). Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition is:[frac{2k + 1}{k^2 (k + 1)^2} = frac{0}{k} + frac{1}{k^2} + frac{0}{k + 1} + frac{-1}{(k + 1)^2} = frac{1}{k^2} - frac{1}{(k + 1)^2}]Oh, that's nice! So, each term in the sum can be written as the difference of two reciprocal squares. That means the sum ( S_n ) becomes:[S_n = sum_{k=1}^{n} left( frac{1}{k^2} - frac{1}{(k + 1)^2} right )]This is a telescoping series because when we write out the terms, most of them will cancel out. Let's write out the first few terms to see the pattern:- For ( k = 1 ): ( frac{1}{1^2} - frac{1}{2^2} = 1 - frac{1}{4} )- For ( k = 2 ): ( frac{1}{2^2} - frac{1}{3^2} = frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{9} )- For ( k = 3 ): ( frac{1}{3^2} - frac{1}{4^2} = frac{1}{9} - frac{1}{16} )- ...- For ( k = n ): ( frac{1}{n^2} - frac{1}{(n + 1)^2} )When we add all these up, the intermediate terms cancel out:[S_n = left(1 - frac{1}{4}right) + left(frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{9}right) + left(frac{1}{9} - frac{1}{16}right) + ldots + left(frac{1}{n^2} - frac{1}{(n + 1)^2}right)]All the terms from ( frac{1}{4} ) to ( frac{1}{n^2} ) cancel out, leaving:[S_n = 1 - frac{1}{(n + 1)^2}]So, the partial sum ( S_n ) simplifies to ( 1 - frac{1}{(n + 1)^2} ). Now, we need to find the limit as ( n ) approaches infinity:[lim_{n to infty} S_n = lim_{n to infty} left(1 - frac{1}{(n + 1)^2}right)]As ( n ) becomes very large, ( (n + 1)^2 ) also becomes very large, so ( frac{1}{(n + 1)^2} ) approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is:[lim_{n to infty} S_n = 1 - 0 = 1]So, the limit of the sum ( S_n ) as ( n ) approaches infinity is 1.**Final Answer**The limit of the sum ( S_n ) as ( n to infty ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Hallie is an artist.

It is known that a total of 260 students from the school participated in the competitions, and 75 male students participated in both. The question is: how many female students participated in the math competition but not in the English competition?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about students participating in math and English competitions. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let's parse the information given:- There are 120 male students and 80 female students in the math competition.- There are 120 female students and 80 male students in the English competition.- The total number of students participating in both competitions is 260.- 75 male students participated in both competitions.And the question is: How many female students participated in the math competition but not in the English competition?Hmm, okay. So, it's a problem involving overlapping sets—students can be in both competitions or just one. I think I can use a Venn diagram approach here, with two circles representing the math and English competitions. The overlapping area will represent students who are in both.Let me denote:- M = Math competition participants- E = English competition participants- Total participants = 260Given that, the total number of participants is the union of M and E, which is |M ∪ E| = 260.We also know the number of males and females in each competition. Let me break it down:For Math competition (M):- Male: 120- Female: 80So, total in M = 120 + 80 = 200.For English competition (E):- Female: 120- Male: 80So, total in E = 120 + 80 = 200.Wait, both competitions have 200 participants each. But the total number of students is 260, which is less than 200 + 200 = 400. That makes sense because some students are participating in both competitions.We also know that 75 male students are in both competitions. So, the overlap between M and E for males is 75.Let me denote:- |M ∩ E|_male = 75But we don't know the overlap for females. Let me denote:- |M ∩ E|_female = xSo, the total overlap |M ∩ E| = 75 + x.Now, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets:|M ∪ E| = |M| + |E| - |M ∩ E|We know |M ∪ E| = 260, |M| = 200, |E| = 200.So,260 = 200 + 200 - (75 + x)Let me compute that:260 = 400 - (75 + x)So, 260 = 400 - 75 - x260 = 325 - xWait, that would mean:x = 325 - 260 = 65So, |M ∩ E|_female = 65.Therefore, 65 female students are in both competitions.But the question is asking for the number of female students who participated in the math competition but not in the English competition.So, in the math competition, there are 80 female students. Out of these, 65 are also in the English competition. Therefore, the number of female students only in math is 80 - 65 = 15.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify.Total participants in math: 200 (120 male, 80 female)Total participants in English: 200 (80 male, 120 female)Total participants overall: 260Overlap for males: 75Overlap for females: 65 (as calculated)So, total overlap is 75 + 65 = 140.Therefore, the number of students only in math is |M| - |M ∩ E| = 200 - 140 = 60.Similarly, the number of students only in English is |E| - |M ∩ E| = 200 - 140 = 60.So, total participants would be only math (60) + only English (60) + both (140) = 260, which matches.Now, breaking it down by gender:Only math:- Male: Total in math is 120. Overlap is 75, so only math male is 120 - 75 = 45.- Female: Total in math is 80. Overlap is 65, so only math female is 80 - 65 = 15.Only English:- Male: Total in English is 80. Overlap is 75, so only English male is 80 - 75 = 5.- Female: Total in English is 120. Overlap is 65, so only English female is 120 - 65 = 55.Let me check the totals:Males:- Only math: 45- Both: 75- Only English: 5Total males: 45 + 75 + 5 = 125Females:- Only math: 15- Both: 65- Only English: 55Total females: 15 + 65 + 55 = 135Total participants: 125 + 135 = 260, which matches.So, the number of female students who participated in the math competition but not in the English competition is 15.Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.Total in math: 120 male + 80 female = 200Total in English: 80 male + 120 female = 200Total participants: 260So, the overlap is 200 + 200 - 260 = 140Of which, 75 are male, so 140 - 75 = 65 are female.Therefore, female only in math: 80 - 65 = 15.Yes, that seems consistent.I think that's the answer. 15 female students participated in math but not in English.**Final Answer**The number of female students who participated in the math competition but not in the English competition is boxed{15}."},{"question":"After doing her math homework, Lena prepared a problem for her math club session. She found two two-digit prime numbers that are obtained from each other by rearranging their digits, and their difference is a perfect square. Which numbers did Lena find?","answer":"Okay, so Lena has this math problem where she found two two-digit prime numbers. These primes are special because you can get one from the other by just rearranging their digits. Also, their difference is a perfect square. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which numbers she found.First, let me break down the problem. We're dealing with two-digit primes. So both numbers are between 10 and 99. They are anagrams of each other, meaning they have the same digits but in a different order. For example, if one is 13, the other could be 31. Also, the difference between these two primes is a perfect square. So, if I subtract the smaller prime from the larger one, the result should be a square number like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc.Alright, so my plan is to list all two-digit prime numbers and then check which ones are anagrams of each other. Once I have those pairs, I'll calculate their differences and see if any of those differences are perfect squares.Let me start by listing all two-digit primes. I remember that two-digit primes start from 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. Let me write them down:11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.Now, I need to find pairs of these primes that are anagrams. That means they should have the same digits but in reverse order. Let's go through the list and see which ones fit.Starting with 11: reversing the digits gives 11 again, so that's the same number, not a different prime. So, 11 can't form a pair with another prime.Next, 13: reversing gives 31. Is 31 in the list? Yes, 31 is a prime. So, 13 and 31 are anagrams. Let me note that pair.17: reversing gives 71. 71 is also a prime. So, 17 and 71 are another pair.19: reversing gives 91. Hmm, is 91 a prime? Wait, 91 divided by 7 is 13, so 91 is 7 times 13, which means it's not a prime. So, 19 doesn't form a pair.23: reversing gives 32. 32 is not a prime because it's even. So, no pair here.29: reversing gives 92. 92 is even, so not a prime. So, no pair.31: we already have this paired with 13.37: reversing gives 73. 73 is a prime. So, 37 and 73 are a pair.41: reversing gives 14. 14 is not a prime. So, no pair.43: reversing gives 34. 34 is even, not a prime. So, no pair.47: reversing gives 74. 74 is even, not a prime. So, no pair.53: reversing gives 35. 35 is divisible by 5, so not a prime. No pair.59: reversing gives 95. 95 is divisible by 5, not a prime. No pair.61: reversing gives 16. 16 is not a prime. No pair.67: reversing gives 76. 76 is even, not a prime. No pair.71: already paired with 17.73: already paired with 37.79: reversing gives 97. 97 is a prime. So, 79 and 97 are a pair.83: reversing gives 38. 38 is even, not a prime. No pair.89: reversing gives 98. 98 is even, not a prime. No pair.97: already paired with 79.So, the anagram prime pairs we have are:13 and 31,17 and 71,37 and 73,79 and 97.Now, for each of these pairs, I need to find their difference and check if it's a perfect square.Let's start with the first pair: 13 and 31.Difference: 31 - 13 = 18. Is 18 a perfect square? Well, 4 squared is 16, 5 squared is 25, so 18 is not a perfect square.Next pair: 17 and 71.Difference: 71 - 17 = 54. Is 54 a perfect square? 7 squared is 49, 8 squared is 64, so no.Third pair: 37 and 73.Difference: 73 - 37 = 36. Hmm, 36 is 6 squared, which is a perfect square. So, this pair satisfies the condition.Fourth pair: 79 and 97.Difference: 97 - 79 = 18. Again, 18 is not a perfect square.So, among all the anagram prime pairs, only 37 and 73 have a difference that is a perfect square (36). Therefore, Lena must have found these two numbers.Wait, just to make sure I didn't miss any other pairs. Let me double-check the list of two-digit primes to ensure I didn't skip any.Looking back, I had 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. I think I covered all of them. So, the only pair that meets the criteria is 37 and 73.Just to confirm, 37 is a prime, 73 is a prime, they are anagrams, and their difference is 36, which is 6 squared. Perfect.I don't think there are any other pairs, so I can confidently say that Lena found the primes 37 and 73.**Final Answer**The two numbers Lena found are boxed{37} and boxed{73}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = a ln x + frac{1}{2x} + frac{3}{2}x + 1, where a in mathbb{R}, the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) at the point (1, f(1)) is perpendicular to the y-axis.1. Find the value of a.2. Find the extreme values of the function f(x).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with the function ( f(x) = a ln x + frac{1}{2x} + frac{3}{2}x + 1 ), where ( a ) is a real number. The question has two parts: first, I need to find the value of ( a ) such that the tangent line to the curve at the point ( (1, f(1)) ) is perpendicular to the ( y )-axis. Second, I have to find the extreme values of the function ( f(x) ).Let me start with the first part. I remember that if a tangent line is perpendicular to the ( y )-axis, that means it's parallel to the ( x )-axis. Wait, no, actually, the ( y )-axis is vertical, so a line perpendicular to it would be horizontal. So, a horizontal line has a slope of zero. Therefore, the tangent line at ( x = 1 ) must have a slope of zero. That means the derivative of ( f(x) ) at ( x = 1 ) should be zero.Okay, so I need to compute ( f'(x) ) and then set ( f'(1) = 0 ) to solve for ( a ).Let me compute the derivative term by term.First term: ( a ln x ). The derivative of ( ln x ) is ( 1/x ), so the derivative of this term is ( a cdot frac{1}{x} ).Second term: ( frac{1}{2x} ). Hmm, that's the same as ( frac{1}{2} x^{-1} ). The derivative of ( x^{-1} ) is ( -x^{-2} ), so the derivative here is ( frac{1}{2} cdot (-x^{-2}) = -frac{1}{2x^2} ).Third term: ( frac{3}{2}x ). The derivative of this is straightforward, it's ( frac{3}{2} ).Fourth term: 1. The derivative of a constant is zero.So putting it all together, the derivative ( f'(x) ) is:( f'(x) = frac{a}{x} - frac{1}{2x^2} + frac{3}{2} ).Now, evaluate this at ( x = 1 ):( f'(1) = frac{a}{1} - frac{1}{2(1)^2} + frac{3}{2} = a - frac{1}{2} + frac{3}{2} ).Simplify that:( a - frac{1}{2} + frac{3}{2} = a + left( -frac{1}{2} + frac{3}{2} right) = a + 1 ).Since the tangent line is horizontal, ( f'(1) = 0 ), so:( a + 1 = 0 ) => ( a = -1 ).Alright, so part 1 is done, ( a = -1 ).Now, moving on to part 2: finding the extreme values of ( f(x) ). Extreme values occur where the derivative is zero or undefined, provided those points are in the domain of ( f(x) ). The domain of ( f(x) ) is ( x > 0 ) because of the ( ln x ) term.So, first, let's write the function with ( a = -1 ):( f(x) = -ln x + frac{1}{2x} + frac{3}{2}x + 1 ).We already found the derivative earlier:( f'(x) = frac{-1}{x} - frac{1}{2x^2} + frac{3}{2} ).To find critical points, set ( f'(x) = 0 ):( frac{-1}{x} - frac{1}{2x^2} + frac{3}{2} = 0 ).Let me rewrite this equation:( -frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{2x^2} + frac{3}{2} = 0 ).To solve for ( x ), maybe I can multiply both sides by ( 2x^2 ) to eliminate denominators. Let's try that.Multiplying each term by ( 2x^2 ):( -2x^2 cdot frac{1}{x} - 2x^2 cdot frac{1}{2x^2} + 2x^2 cdot frac{3}{2} = 0 ).Simplify each term:First term: ( -2x^2 cdot frac{1}{x} = -2x ).Second term: ( -2x^2 cdot frac{1}{2x^2} = -1 ).Third term: ( 2x^2 cdot frac{3}{2} = 3x^2 ).So, putting it all together:( -2x - 1 + 3x^2 = 0 ).Let me rearrange this:( 3x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 ).Now, we have a quadratic equation in terms of ( x ). Let's solve for ( x ) using the quadratic formula.Quadratic equation: ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ).Here, ( a = 3 ), ( b = -2 ), ( c = -1 ).Discriminant ( D = b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(3)(-1) = 4 + 12 = 16 ).Square root of discriminant: ( sqrt{16} = 4 ).Solutions:( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{D}}{2a} = frac{2 pm 4}{6} ).So, two solutions:1. ( x = frac{2 + 4}{6} = frac{6}{6} = 1 ).2. ( x = frac{2 - 4}{6} = frac{-2}{6} = -frac{1}{3} ).But since the domain of ( f(x) ) is ( x > 0 ), we discard ( x = -frac{1}{3} ) as it's negative. So, the only critical point is at ( x = 1 ).Wait, but earlier, we found that at ( x = 1 ), the derivative is zero because it's a horizontal tangent. So, that's our critical point.Now, to determine whether this critical point is a minimum or maximum, we can use the second derivative test.First, compute the second derivative ( f''(x) ).We have ( f'(x) = -frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{2x^2} + frac{3}{2} ).Compute ( f''(x) ):Derivative of ( -frac{1}{x} ) is ( frac{1}{x^2} ).Derivative of ( -frac{1}{2x^2} ) is ( frac{1}{x^3} ).Derivative of ( frac{3}{2} ) is 0.So, ( f''(x) = frac{1}{x^2} + frac{1}{x^3} ).Evaluate ( f''(1) ):( f''(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 ).Since ( f''(1) = 2 > 0 ), the function is concave upward at ( x = 1 ), so this critical point is a local minimum.Therefore, the function ( f(x) ) has a local minimum at ( x = 1 ). Is there a maximum? Since the function is defined for ( x > 0 ), let's check the behavior as ( x ) approaches 0 and as ( x ) approaches infinity.As ( x to 0^+ ):- ( -ln x ) tends to infinity (since ( ln x to -infty ), so negative of that is positive infinity).- ( frac{1}{2x} ) tends to infinity.- ( frac{3}{2}x ) tends to 0.- The constant 1 is just 1.So, overall, ( f(x) to infty ) as ( x to 0^+ ).As ( x to infty ):- ( -ln x ) tends to negative infinity.- ( frac{1}{2x} ) tends to 0.- ( frac{3}{2}x ) tends to infinity.- The constant 1 is just 1.So, the dominant terms are ( -ln x ) and ( frac{3}{2}x ). As ( x to infty ), ( frac{3}{2}x ) grows much faster than ( -ln x ) decays, so ( f(x) to infty ).Therefore, the function tends to infinity as ( x ) approaches both 0 and infinity, and it has a single critical point at ( x = 1 ), which is a local minimum. So, this local minimum is actually the global minimum of the function.Therefore, the extreme value is a minimum at ( x = 1 ). Let me compute ( f(1) ):( f(1) = -ln 1 + frac{1}{2(1)} + frac{3}{2}(1) + 1 ).Simplify:- ( ln 1 = 0 ), so first term is 0.- ( frac{1}{2} ).- ( frac{3}{2} ).- 1.So, adding them up: ( 0 + frac{1}{2} + frac{3}{2} + 1 = frac{1}{2} + frac{3}{2} + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 ).Therefore, the function has a global minimum at ( (1, 3) ), and no other extreme values because there are no other critical points.Wait, hold on, let me double-check the computation of ( f(1) ):( f(1) = -ln 1 + frac{1}{2(1)} + frac{3}{2}(1) + 1 ).Yes, ( ln 1 = 0 ), so first term is 0.Second term: ( frac{1}{2} ).Third term: ( frac{3}{2} ).Fourth term: 1.So, adding up: ( 0 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 1 = 3 ). Yep, that's correct.So, in summary:1. The value of ( a ) is ( -1 ).2. The function ( f(x) ) has a global minimum at ( x = 1 ) with value 3, and no other extreme values.I think that's all. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.First part: Found ( a = -1 ) by setting the derivative at ( x = 1 ) to zero because the tangent is horizontal.Second part: Found critical points by setting derivative to zero, got ( x = 1 ) as the only critical point in the domain. Then, checked the second derivative, which was positive, indicating a local minimum. Checked the behavior at the boundaries, saw that the function goes to infinity on both ends, so this local minimum is the global minimum. Calculated ( f(1) = 3 ).Everything seems to check out.**Final Answer**1. The value of ( a ) is boxed{-1}.2. The function ( f(x) ) has a global minimum at ( x = 1 ) with value boxed{3}."},{"question":"Ten people wanted to start a club. To do this, they need to collect a certain amount of entrance fees. If there had been five more organizers, each of them would have had to contribute 100 less. How much did each person contribute?","answer":"First, I'll define the variables. Let ( x ) be the number of people who actually contributed, and ( y ) be the amount each person contributed.The total entrance fee is ( x times y ).If there had been five more organizers, the number of people would be ( x + 5 ), and each person would contribute ( y - 100 ). The total entrance fee remains the same, so ( (x + 5) times (y - 100) ) is also equal to ( x times y ).Setting up the equation:[(x + 5)(y - 100) = xy]Expanding the left side:[xy - 100x + 5y - 500 = xy]Subtracting ( xy ) from both sides:[-100x + 5y - 500 = 0]Rearranging the equation:[5y = 100x + 500][y = 20x + 100]This equation shows that the contribution per person depends on the number of people. However, without additional information, there are infinitely many solutions.

The vectors are given as:x = {-1; 7; 0}p = {0; 3; 1}q = {1; -1; 2}r = {2; -1; 0}Hmm, okay. So decomposition means expressing x as a linear combination of p, q, and r. That is, I need to find scalars a, b, c such that:x = a*p + b*q + c*rSo, writing that out in terms of components, I get:{-1; 7; 0} = a*{0; 3; 1} + b*{1; -1; 2} + c*{2; -1; 0}Breaking this down component-wise, we can write three equations:1. For the first component: -1 = 0*a + 1*b + 2*c2. For the second component: 7 = 3*a + (-1)*b + (-1)*c3. For the third component: 0 = 1*a + 2*b + 0*cSo, simplifying these equations:1. -1 = b + 2c2. 7 = 3a - b - c3. 0 = a + 2bAlright, so now I have a system of three equations with three unknowns: a, b, c. Let's write them out again:1. b + 2c = -12. 3a - b - c = 73. a + 2b = 0Hmm, okay. Let me see how to solve this. Maybe substitution or elimination would work here.Looking at equation 3: a + 2b = 0. So, I can express a in terms of b: a = -2b.That's helpful. Let me substitute a = -2b into equation 2.Equation 2 becomes: 3*(-2b) - b - c = 7Calculating that: -6b - b - c = 7 => -7b - c = 7So, equation 2 is now: -7b - c = 7Now, equation 1 is: b + 2c = -1So, now I have two equations with two variables, b and c:1. b + 2c = -12. -7b - c = 7Let me solve this system. Maybe I can solve equation 1 for b and substitute into equation 2.From equation 1: b = -1 - 2cSubstitute into equation 2:-7*(-1 - 2c) - c = 7Calculating that: 7 + 14c - c = 7Simplify: 7 + 13c = 7Subtract 7 from both sides: 13c = 0 => c = 0Okay, so c is 0. Now, substitute c = 0 back into equation 1:b + 2*0 = -1 => b = -1So, b is -1. Then, from equation 3, a = -2b = -2*(-1) = 2So, a = 2, b = -1, c = 0Let me check these values in equation 2 to make sure:3a - b - c = 3*2 - (-1) - 0 = 6 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's correct.And equation 1: b + 2c = -1 + 0 = -1. Correct.Equation 3: a + 2b = 2 + 2*(-1) = 2 - 2 = 0. Correct.So, all equations are satisfied.Therefore, the decomposition is x = 2p - q + 0*r, which simplifies to x = 2p - q.Wait, so c is zero, so r doesn't contribute to the decomposition. Interesting.Let me double-check by computing 2p - q:2p = 2*{0; 3; 1} = {0; 6; 2}-q = -1*{1; -1; 2} = {-1; 1; -2}Adding them together: {0 -1; 6 +1; 2 -2} = {-1; 7; 0}, which is exactly x.Perfect, that works out.So, the coefficients are a = 2, b = -1, c = 0.Therefore, x can be expressed as 2p - q.**Final Answer**The decomposition of vector ( x ) is given by ( x = 2p - q ). Thus, the coefficients are ( a = 2 ), ( b = -1 ), and ( c = 0 ). The final answer is (boxed{x = 2p - q}).**Final Answer**The decomposition of vector ( x ) is (boxed{x = 2p - q})."},{"question":"Josh went to the shopping center. He bought 9 films and 4 books.

What is (5 clubsuit (3 clubsuit 6)) clubsuit 1?","answer":"Okay, so I have this math problem here: Let ( a clubsuit b = frac{2a}{b} cdot frac{b}{a} ). I need to find ( (5 clubsuit (3 clubsuit 6)) clubsuit 1 ). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with the custom operator, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I should probably understand what the operator ( clubsuit ) does. It's defined as ( a clubsuit b = frac{2a}{b} cdot frac{b}{a} ). Let me simplify that expression to see if it can be reduced. So, multiplying those two fractions: ( frac{2a}{b} times frac{b}{a} ). When I multiply the numerators, I get ( 2a times b = 2ab ). The denominators are ( b times a = ab ). So, the whole thing becomes ( frac{2ab}{ab} ). Oh, wait, the ( ab ) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, right? So that simplifies to just 2. Wait, so does that mean ( a clubsuit b = 2 ) for any ( a ) and ( b )? That seems too simple. Let me double-check. Starting again: ( frac{2a}{b} times frac{b}{a} ). The ( a ) in the numerator of the first fraction cancels with the ( a ) in the denominator of the second fraction. Similarly, the ( b ) in the denominator of the first fraction cancels with the ( b ) in the numerator of the second fraction. So, we're left with ( 2 times 1 = 2 ). Yeah, that seems correct. So regardless of the values of ( a ) and ( b ), as long as ( a ) and ( b ) are not zero, the operation ( a clubsuit b ) will always equal 2. Okay, that makes the problem a bit easier. So, if every time I use the ( clubsuit ) operator, it just gives me 2, then I can substitute that into the problem. Let me write down the original expression again: ( (5 clubsuit (3 clubsuit 6)) clubsuit 1 ). Starting from the innermost operation: ( 3 clubsuit 6 ). As I just figured out, this should be 2. So, the expression simplifies to ( (5 clubsuit 2) clubsuit 1 ). Now, computing ( 5 clubsuit 2 ). Again, using the same logic, this should also be 2. So, now the expression becomes ( 2 clubsuit 1 ). And once more, ( 2 clubsuit 1 ) is 2. Wait, so does that mean the entire expression simplifies to 2? Let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Compute ( 3 clubsuit 6 ):   - ( 3 clubsuit 6 = frac{2 times 3}{6} times frac{6}{3} )   - Simplify each fraction:     - ( frac{6}{6} = 1 )     - ( frac{6}{3} = 2 )   - Multiply them: ( 1 times 2 = 2 )   - So, ( 3 clubsuit 6 = 2 )2. Now compute ( 5 clubsuit 2 ):   - ( 5 clubsuit 2 = frac{2 times 5}{2} times frac{2}{5} )   - Simplify each fraction:     - ( frac{10}{2} = 5 )     - ( frac{2}{5} = 0.4 )   - Multiply them: ( 5 times 0.4 = 2 )   - So, ( 5 clubsuit 2 = 2 )3. Finally, compute ( 2 clubsuit 1 ):   - ( 2 clubsuit 1 = frac{2 times 2}{1} times frac{1}{2} )   - Simplify each fraction:     - ( frac{4}{1} = 4 )     - ( frac{1}{2} = 0.5 )   - Multiply them: ( 4 times 0.5 = 2 )   - So, ( 2 clubsuit 1 = 2 )Yep, each time it's giving me 2. So, the entire expression simplifies to 2. That seems consistent.Just to make sure, let me think about whether there's any case where ( a clubsuit b ) wouldn't be 2. Well, if ( a ) or ( b ) is zero, then we might have some undefined expressions because of division by zero. But in this problem, all the numbers we're dealing with are positive integers: 5, 3, 6, and 1. So, we don't have to worry about division by zero here. Therefore, every time we apply the ( clubsuit ) operator with non-zero numbers, it will result in 2. So, regardless of the numbers, as long as they are non-zero, the operation just gives 2. So, putting it all together:- ( 3 clubsuit 6 = 2 )- ( 5 clubsuit 2 = 2 )- ( 2 clubsuit 1 = 2 )Therefore, the final result is 2.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the simplification of the operator makes it straightforward.**Final Answer**boxed{2}"},{"question":"If (2x - 5 = 15), the value of (x) is:(A) 5(B) -5(C) 10(D) 0(E) -10","answer":"First, I'll start with the equation (2x - 5 = 15).To isolate the term with (x), I'll add 5 to both sides of the equation:[2x - 5 + 5 = 15 + 5][2x = 20]Next, I'll solve for (x) by dividing both sides by 2:[frac{2x}{2} = frac{20}{2}][x = 10]Finally, I'll check the answer options and see that option (C) is 10, which matches my solution."},{"question":"Calculate the following sum given (xyz = 1):[frac{1}{1+x+xy}+frac{1}{1+y+yz}+frac{1}{1+z+zx}]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the sum of three fractions: (frac{1}{1+x+xy} + frac{1}{1+y+yz} + frac{1}{1+z+zx}), and I know that (xyz = 1). Hmm, that seems interesting. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.First, I notice that each term in the sum has a similar structure. Each denominator is of the form (1 + text{variable} + text{product of two variables}). Maybe there's a way to manipulate each term to make them look more similar or find a common pattern.Given that (xyz = 1), I can express one variable in terms of the others. For example, (z = frac{1}{xy}). Maybe substituting this into the terms will help simplify the expression.Let me try substituting (z = frac{1}{xy}) into the third term: (frac{1}{1 + z + zx}). Plugging in, we get:[frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{xy} + frac{x}{xy}} = frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{xy} + frac{1}{y}]Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should look for another approach.Another idea: perhaps each fraction can be rewritten in a way that relates to the others. Let me consider the first term: (frac{1}{1 + x + xy}). If I factor out an (x) from the denominator, it becomes:[frac{1}{x(1 + frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{x} cdot y)}]Wait, that might not be helpful. Maybe I should multiply numerator and denominator by something to simplify.Looking at the first term again: (frac{1}{1 + x + xy}). If I multiply numerator and denominator by (z), since (xyz = 1), (z = frac{1}{xy}). Let's see:Multiplying numerator and denominator by (z):[frac{z}{z(1 + x + xy)} = frac{z}{z + xz + xyz}]But since (xyz = 1), this becomes:[frac{z}{z + xz + 1}]Hmm, that's interesting. So, the first term becomes (frac{z}{1 + z + xz}). Wait, that looks similar to the third term in the original sum: (frac{1}{1 + z + zx}).So, if I rewrite the first term as (frac{z}{1 + z + zx}), then the third term is (frac{1}{1 + z + zx}). So, adding these two together, we get:[frac{z}{1 + z + zx} + frac{1}{1 + z + zx} = frac{z + 1}{1 + z + zx}]Which simplifies to:[frac{1 + z}{1 + z + zx}]Hmm, that seems like progress. Let me see if I can do something similar with the other terms.Looking at the second term: (frac{1}{1 + y + yz}). Let me try multiplying numerator and denominator by (x):[frac{x}{x(1 + y + yz)} = frac{x}{x + xy + xyz}]Again, since (xyz = 1), this becomes:[frac{x}{x + xy + 1}]So, the second term is (frac{x}{1 + x + xy}). Wait a minute, that's similar to the first term. The first term was (frac{1}{1 + x + xy}), and now the second term is (frac{x}{1 + x + xy}). So, adding them together:[frac{1}{1 + x + xy} + frac{x}{1 + x + xy} = frac{1 + x}{1 + x + xy}]Which simplifies to:[frac{1 + x}{1 + x + xy}]Okay, so now I have transformed the first and second terms into (frac{1 + x}{1 + x + xy}) and the third term was transformed into (frac{1 + z}{1 + z + zx}). So, the entire sum becomes:[frac{1 + x}{1 + x + xy} + frac{1 + z}{1 + z + zx}]Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because originally, we had three terms, and now I have two terms. Maybe I made a miscalculation.Let me recap:1. First term: (frac{1}{1 + x + xy}) multiplied by (z/z) becomes (frac{z}{1 + z + zx}).2. Third term: (frac{1}{1 + z + zx}).3. So, adding first and third term: (frac{z + 1}{1 + z + zx} = frac{1 + z}{1 + z + zx}).Similarly, for the second term:1. Second term: (frac{1}{1 + y + yz}) multiplied by (x/x) becomes (frac{x}{1 + x + xy}).2. First term was (frac{1}{1 + x + xy}).3. Adding first and second term: (frac{1 + x}{1 + x + xy}).Wait, so actually, if I pair the first and third terms, and then pair the first and second terms, I get two different expressions. Maybe I need a different approach.Perhaps instead of pairing, I should consider all three terms together. Let me write all three terms after substitution:1. First term: (frac{z}{1 + z + zx})2. Second term: (frac{x}{1 + x + xy})3. Third term: (frac{1}{1 + z + zx})Wait, so the first and third terms have the same denominator, (1 + z + zx). So, adding them together:[frac{z + 1}{1 + z + zx} = frac{1 + z}{1 + z + zx}]Similarly, the second term is (frac{x}{1 + x + xy}). So, the total sum is:[frac{1 + z}{1 + z + zx} + frac{x}{1 + x + xy}]Hmm, but this still doesn't seem to resolve the problem. Maybe I need to manipulate the second term further.Looking at the second term: (frac{x}{1 + x + xy}). Let me factor out an (x) from the denominator:[frac{x}{x(1 + frac{1}{x} + y)} = frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{x} + y}]But (xyz = 1), so (frac{1}{x} = yz). Therefore, substituting:[frac{1}{1 + yz + y} = frac{1}{1 + y + yz}]Wait, that's just the original second term. So, that didn't help. Maybe another substitution.Alternatively, let me consider the entire expression:[frac{1}{1 + x + xy} + frac{1}{1 + y + yz} + frac{1}{1 + z + zx}]Given that (xyz = 1), perhaps I can express each term in terms of a single variable. Let me try setting (x = a), (y = b), and (z = frac{1}{ab}). Then, substituting into each term:First term: (frac{1}{1 + a + a cdot b})Second term: (frac{1}{1 + b + b cdot frac{1}{ab}} = frac{1}{1 + b + frac{1}{a}})Third term: (frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{ab} + frac{1}{ab} cdot a} = frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{ab} + frac{1}{b}})Hmm, this might not be simplifying things. Maybe I need to find a common denominator or see if the sum telescopes.Alternatively, I recall that sometimes in symmetric expressions, adding fractions can result in cancellation. Let me try adding all three terms together.Let me denote the sum as (S):[S = frac{1}{1 + x + xy} + frac{1}{1 + y + yz} + frac{1}{1 + z + zx}]I want to find (S). Let me try to express each denominator in terms of (xyz = 1).Looking at the first denominator: (1 + x + xy). Since (xyz = 1), (xy = frac{1}{z}). So, substituting:[1 + x + frac{1}{z}]Similarly, the second denominator: (1 + y + yz). Since (yz = frac{1}{x}), substituting:[1 + y + frac{1}{x}]Third denominator: (1 + z + zx). Since (zx = frac{1}{y}), substituting:[1 + z + frac{1}{y}]So, now the sum (S) becomes:[S = frac{1}{1 + x + frac{1}{z}} + frac{1}{1 + y + frac{1}{x}} + frac{1}{1 + z + frac{1}{y}}]Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can write each term with a common denominator.For the first term:[frac{1}{1 + x + frac{1}{z}} = frac{z}{z + xz + 1}]Similarly, the second term:[frac{1}{1 + y + frac{1}{x}} = frac{x}{x + xy + 1}]Third term:[frac{1}{1 + z + frac{1}{y}} = frac{y}{y + yz + 1}]So, substituting back, the sum (S) is:[frac{z}{1 + z + xz} + frac{x}{1 + x + xy} + frac{y}{1 + y + yz}]Wait a minute, this looks similar to the original sum, but each term is now multiplied by a variable. Let me denote the original sum as (S), so:[S = frac{1}{1 + x + xy} + frac{1}{1 + y + yz} + frac{1}{1 + z + zx}]And the transformed sum is:[frac{z}{1 + z + xz} + frac{x}{1 + x + xy} + frac{y}{1 + y + yz}]Which is equal to (z cdot frac{1}{1 + z + xz} + x cdot frac{1}{1 + x + xy} + y cdot frac{1}{1 + y + yz})But notice that ( frac{1}{1 + z + xz} = frac{1}{1 + z + xz} ), which is the third term of the original sum. Similarly, ( frac{1}{1 + x + xy} ) is the first term, and ( frac{1}{1 + y + yz} ) is the second term.So, the transformed sum is:[z cdot text{(third term)} + x cdot text{(first term)} + y cdot text{(second term)}]Which is:[z cdot frac{1}{1 + z + zx} + x cdot frac{1}{1 + x + xy} + y cdot frac{1}{1 + y + yz}]But this is equal to:[z cdot text{(third term)} + x cdot text{(first term)} + y cdot text{(second term)} = z cdot frac{1}{1 + z + zx} + x cdot frac{1}{1 + x + xy} + y cdot frac{1}{1 + y + yz}]Wait, but that's the same as the transformed sum. So, if I denote the transformed sum as (T), then:[T = z cdot text{(third term)} + x cdot text{(first term)} + y cdot text{(second term)}]But I don't see an immediate relationship between (S) and (T). Maybe I need to consider adding (S) and (T) together.Let me compute (S + T):[S + T = left( frac{1}{1 + x + xy} + frac{1}{1 + y + yz} + frac{1}{1 + z + zx} right) + left( frac{z}{1 + z + zx} + frac{x}{1 + x + xy} + frac{y}{1 + y + yz} right)]Grouping similar terms:[= left( frac{1}{1 + x + xy} + frac{x}{1 + x + xy} right) + left( frac{1}{1 + y + yz} + frac{y}{1 + y + yz} right) + left( frac{1}{1 + z + zx} + frac{z}{1 + z + zx} right)]Each pair simplifies as follows:[frac{1 + x}{1 + x + xy}, quad frac{1 + y}{1 + y + yz}, quad frac{1 + z}{1 + z + zx}]So, (S + T = frac{1 + x}{1 + x + xy} + frac{1 + y}{1 + y + yz} + frac{1 + z}{1 + z + zx})Hmm, this seems like another expression, but perhaps I can relate it back to (S). Let me see.Notice that each term in (S + T) is of the form (frac{1 + text{variable}}{1 + text{variable} + text{product}}). Let me see if I can express this as (1 - frac{text{something}}{denominator}).For example, take the first term:[frac{1 + x}{1 + x + xy} = frac{(1 + x + xy) - xy}{1 + x + xy} = 1 - frac{xy}{1 + x + xy}]Similarly, the second term:[frac{1 + y}{1 + y + yz} = 1 - frac{yz}{1 + y + yz}]And the third term:[frac{1 + z}{1 + z + zx} = 1 - frac{zx}{1 + z + zx}]So, substituting back into (S + T):[S + T = left(1 - frac{xy}{1 + x + xy}right) + left(1 - frac{yz}{1 + y + yz}right) + left(1 - frac{zx}{1 + z + zx}right)]Simplifying:[S + T = 3 - left( frac{xy}{1 + x + xy} + frac{yz}{1 + y + yz} + frac{zx}{1 + z + zx} right )]But notice that the terms inside the parentheses are similar to the transformed sum (T). Let me check:Earlier, we had:[T = frac{z}{1 + z + zx} + frac{x}{1 + x + xy} + frac{y}{1 + y + yz}]So, the terms inside the parentheses in (S + T) are:[frac{xy}{1 + x + xy} + frac{yz}{1 + y + yz} + frac{zx}{1 + z + zx}]Which is equal to (xy cdot frac{1}{1 + x + xy} + yz cdot frac{1}{1 + y + yz} + zx cdot frac{1}{1 + z + zx})But since (xyz = 1), we can write (xy = frac{1}{z}), (yz = frac{1}{x}), and (zx = frac{1}{y}). Substituting these:[frac{xy}{1 + x + xy} = frac{frac{1}{z}}{1 + x + frac{1}{z}} = frac{1}{z(1 + x) + 1}]Wait, maybe that's not the most straightforward way. Alternatively, since (xy = frac{1}{z}), then:[frac{xy}{1 + x + xy} = frac{frac{1}{z}}{1 + x + frac{1}{z}} = frac{1}{z + xz + 1}]Similarly, (frac{yz}{1 + y + yz} = frac{frac{1}{x}}{1 + y + frac{1}{x}} = frac{1}{x + xy + 1})And (frac{zx}{1 + z + zx} = frac{frac{1}{y}}{1 + z + frac{1}{y}} = frac{1}{y + yz + 1})So, the terms inside the parentheses become:[frac{1}{1 + x + xz} + frac{1}{1 + y + yz} + frac{1}{1 + z + zx}]Wait, but that's exactly the original sum (S)! So, we have:[S + T = 3 - S]Therefore:[S + T = 3 - S]Which implies:[2S + T = 3]Wait, no, actually, (S + T = 3 - S), so:[S + T = 3 - S implies 2S + T = 3]But I need another equation relating (S) and (T). Earlier, we had:[T = z cdot text{(third term)} + x cdot text{(first term)} + y cdot text{(second term)}]But I don't see a direct relationship. Alternatively, perhaps I can express (T) in terms of (S).Wait, let's think differently. From (S + T = 3 - S), we have:[2S + T = 3]But I also need another equation. Let me compute (T) in terms of (S).Recall that:[T = frac{z}{1 + z + zx} + frac{x}{1 + x + xy} + frac{y}{1 + y + yz}]But notice that each term in (T) is similar to the corresponding term in (S), but multiplied by a variable. Let me see if I can express (T) in terms of (S).Wait, if I factor out the variables:[T = z cdot frac{1}{1 + z + zx} + x cdot frac{1}{1 + x + xy} + y cdot frac{1}{1 + y + yz}]But from earlier, we saw that:[frac{1}{1 + z + zx} = frac{1}{1 + z + frac{1}{y}} = frac{y}{y + yz + 1}]Similarly, (frac{1}{1 + x + xy} = frac{1}{1 + x + frac{1}{z}} = frac{z}{z + xz + 1}), and (frac{1}{1 + y + yz} = frac{1}{1 + y + frac{1}{x}} = frac{x}{x + xy + 1}).So, substituting back into (T):[T = z cdot frac{z}{z + xz + 1} + x cdot frac{x}{x + xy + 1} + y cdot frac{y}{y + yz + 1}]Simplifying each term:[= frac{z^2}{1 + z + xz} + frac{x^2}{1 + x + xy} + frac{y^2}{1 + y + yz}]Hmm, that seems more complicated. Maybe this isn't the right path.Wait, perhaps instead of trying to find (T) in terms of (S), I can use the equation (S + T = 3 - S) to express (T = 3 - 2S). Then, if I can find another equation involving (T), I can solve for (S).But I'm not sure how to get another equation. Maybe I need to consider multiplying (S) by something.Alternatively, let me consider the original expression for (T):[T = frac{z}{1 + z + zx} + frac{x}{1 + x + xy} + frac{y}{1 + y + yz}]But notice that each term in (T) is equal to (frac{z}{1 + z + zx} = frac{z}{1 + z + frac{1}{y}} = frac{zy}{y + yz + 1}). Similarly, the other terms can be expressed as:[frac{x}{1 + x + xy} = frac{x}{1 + x + frac{1}{z}} = frac{xz}{z + xz + 1}][frac{y}{1 + y + yz} = frac{y}{1 + y + frac{1}{x}} = frac{xy}{x + xy + 1}]So, substituting back into (T):[T = frac{zy}{1 + y + yz} + frac{xz}{1 + z + zx} + frac{xy}{1 + x + xy}]But notice that each of these terms is similar to the terms in (S). Specifically, each term is the product of two variables over the denominator of the corresponding term in (S).But since (xyz = 1), we can write (zy = frac{1}{x}), (xz = frac{1}{y}), and (xy = frac{1}{z}). Therefore:[T = frac{frac{1}{x}}{1 + y + yz} + frac{frac{1}{y}}{1 + z + zx} + frac{frac{1}{z}}{1 + x + xy}]Which simplifies to:[T = frac{1}{x(1 + y + yz)} + frac{1}{y(1 + z + zx)} + frac{1}{z(1 + x + xy)}]Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor out the variables:[T = frac{1}{x} cdot frac{1}{1 + y + yz} + frac{1}{y} cdot frac{1}{1 + z + zx} + frac{1}{z} cdot frac{1}{1 + x + xy}]But since (xyz = 1), (frac{1}{x} = yz), (frac{1}{y} = xz), and (frac{1}{z} = xy). So substituting:[T = yz cdot frac{1}{1 + y + yz} + xz cdot frac{1}{1 + z + zx} + xy cdot frac{1}{1 + x + xy}]Which is exactly the same as the terms inside the parentheses in the expression for (S + T). Earlier, we saw that:[S + T = 3 - S]And the terms inside the parentheses were equal to (S). Therefore, (T = S). Wait, is that correct?Wait, no. Let me recap:We had:[S + T = 3 - S]Which implies:[2S + T = 3]But then, when trying to express (T), we found that (T) is equal to the sum:[frac{1}{x(1 + y + yz)} + frac{1}{y(1 + z + zx)} + frac{1}{z(1 + x + xy)}]But since (xyz = 1), this simplifies to:[yz cdot frac{1}{1 + y + yz} + xz cdot frac{1}{1 + z + zx} + xy cdot frac{1}{1 + x + xy}]Which is equal to:[frac{yz}{1 + y + yz} + frac{xz}{1 + z + zx} + frac{xy}{1 + x + xy}]But notice that:[frac{yz}{1 + y + yz} = frac{yz}{1 + y + yz} = frac{1}{frac{1}{yz} + frac{1}{yz} cdot y + 1}]Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, notice that:[frac{yz}{1 + y + yz} = frac{yz}{1 + y(1 + z)} = frac{yz}{1 + y + yz}]Not sure. Alternatively, let me consider that (yz = frac{1}{x}), so:[frac{yz}{1 + y + yz} = frac{frac{1}{x}}{1 + y + frac{1}{x}} = frac{1}{x(1 + y) + 1}]Similarly, the other terms:[frac{xz}{1 + z + zx} = frac{frac{1}{y}}{1 + z + frac{1}{y}} = frac{1}{y(1 + z) + 1}][frac{xy}{1 + x + xy} = frac{frac{1}{z}}{1 + x + frac{1}{z}} = frac{1}{z(1 + x) + 1}]So, (T) becomes:[T = frac{1}{x(1 + y) + 1} + frac{1}{y(1 + z) + 1} + frac{1}{z(1 + x) + 1}]Hmm, not sure. Maybe I need to take a different approach.Let me try plugging in specific values for (x), (y), and (z) that satisfy (xyz = 1) to see if I can find a pattern or guess the answer.Let me choose (x = y = z = 1). Then, (xyz = 1 times 1 times 1 = 1), which satisfies the condition.Calculating each term:First term: (frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1 times 1} = frac{1}{3})Second term: (frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1 times 1} = frac{1}{3})Third term: (frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1 times 1} = frac{1}{3})So, the sum is (frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} = 1).Interesting, so when (x = y = z = 1), the sum is 1.Let me try another set of values. Let me choose (x = 2), (y = frac{1}{2}), then (z = frac{1}{xy} = frac{1}{2 times frac{1}{2}} = 1).So, (x = 2), (y = frac{1}{2}), (z = 1).Calculating each term:First term: (frac{1}{1 + 2 + 2 times frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{1 + 2 + 1} = frac{1}{4})Second term: (frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} times 1} = frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{2})Third term: (frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1 times 2} = frac{1}{1 + 1 + 2} = frac{1}{4})So, the sum is (frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} = 1).Hmm, again, the sum is 1. Maybe the answer is always 1?Let me test another set. Let me choose (x = 3), (y = frac{1}{3}), so (z = frac{1}{3 times frac{1}{3}} = 1).First term: (frac{1}{1 + 3 + 3 times frac{1}{3}} = frac{1}{1 + 3 + 1} = frac{1}{5})Second term: (frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} times 1} = frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3}} = frac{1}{1 + frac{2}{3}} = frac{1}{frac{5}{3}} = frac{3}{5})Third term: (frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1 times 3} = frac{1}{1 + 1 + 3} = frac{1}{5})Sum: (frac{1}{5} + frac{3}{5} + frac{1}{5} = 1). Again, 1.Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe the sum is always 1. Let me try a different set where (x), (y), (z) are not 1.Let me choose (x = 2), (y = 3), so (z = frac{1}{2 times 3} = frac{1}{6}).First term: (frac{1}{1 + 2 + 2 times 3} = frac{1}{1 + 2 + 6} = frac{1}{9})Second term: (frac{1}{1 + 3 + 3 times frac{1}{6}} = frac{1}{1 + 3 + frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{4.5} = frac{2}{9})Third term: (frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{6} times 2} = frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{3}} = frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{6} + frac{2}{6}} = frac{1}{1 + frac{3}{6}} = frac{1}{1.5} = frac{2}{3})Sum: (frac{1}{9} + frac{2}{9} + frac{2}{3} = frac{3}{9} + frac{6}{9} = frac{9}{9} = 1).Wow, again, the sum is 1. So, it seems like regardless of the values of (x), (y), (z) (as long as (xyz = 1)), the sum is always 1.Therefore, the answer is 1.But just to be thorough, let me try another set. Let me choose (x = frac{1}{2}), (y = frac{1}{3}), so (z = frac{1}{frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{3}} = 6).First term: (frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{3}} = frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{6}} = frac{1}{1 + frac{2}{4} + frac{1}{6}} = frac{1}{frac{12}{12} + frac{6}{12} + frac{2}{12}} = frac{1}{frac{20}{12}} = frac{12}{20} = frac{3}{5})Second term: (frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} times 6} = frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{3} + 2} = frac{1}{3 + frac{1}{3}} = frac{1}{frac{10}{3}} = frac{3}{10})Third term: (frac{1}{1 + 6 + 6 times frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{1 + 6 + 3} = frac{1}{10})Sum: (frac{3}{5} + frac{3}{10} + frac{1}{10} = frac{6}{10} + frac{3}{10} + frac{1}{10} = frac{10}{10} = 1).Again, the sum is 1. It seems consistent across different values. Therefore, I can conclude that the sum is always 1 when (xyz = 1).**Final Answer**The sum is equal to boxed{1}."},{"question":"If the value of x^{2}+x+1 is 8, then the value of 4x^{2}+4x+9 is:A: 37B: 25C: 32D: 0","answer":"First, I'll start by setting up the equation given in the problem: ( x^2 + x + 1 = 8 ).Next, I'll subtract 8 from both sides to simplify the equation:[ x^2 + x + 1 - 8 = 0 ][ x^2 + x - 7 = 0 ]Now, I'll look at the expression we need to find: ( 4x^2 + 4x + 9 ).

Some days are successful, and on such days Petya's capital increases by 1000, while Vasya's capital increases by 10%. On other days, which are unsuccessful, Petya's capital decreases by 2000, and Vasya's capital decreases by 20%. After some time, Petya's capital returned to its initial state. What happened to Vasya's capital: did it decrease, increase, or remain the same?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Petya and Vasya are playing on the stock exchange. Some days are successful, and some are not. On successful days, Petya's capital increases by 1000, and Vasya's increases by 10%. On unsuccessful days, Petya's capital decreases by 2000, and Vasya's decreases by 20%. After some time, Petya's capital returns to its initial state. The question is, what happened to Vasya's capital? Did it decrease, increase, or remain the same?Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, let's denote the initial capital of Petya as P and Vasya as V. We need to figure out how Vasya's capital changes over time, given that Petya's capital returns to its initial value.So, let's think about the changes in Petya's capital. On a successful day, Petya gains 1000, and on an unsuccessful day, he loses 2000. So, if we let S be the number of successful days and U be the number of unsuccessful days, then the total change in Petya's capital is 1000*S - 2000*U. Since his capital returns to the initial state, this total change must be zero. Therefore, 1000*S - 2000*U = 0.Simplifying that equation, we can divide both sides by 1000: S - 2*U = 0, which implies that S = 2*U. So, the number of successful days is twice the number of unsuccessful days.Alright, so now we know the relationship between S and U. Now, let's think about Vasya's capital. On each successful day, his capital increases by 10%, which means it's multiplied by 1.1. On each unsuccessful day, it decreases by 20%, so it's multiplied by 0.8.Therefore, after S successful days and U unsuccessful days, Vasya's capital will be V*(1.1)^S*(0.8)^U.But we know that S = 2*U, so we can substitute that in. So, Vasya's capital becomes V*(1.1)^(2U)*(0.8)^U.Let me compute that. Let's write it as V*(1.1^2)^U*(0.8)^U. Since 1.1 squared is 1.21, so it's V*(1.21)^U*(0.8)^U.Now, 1.21 multiplied by 0.8 is 0.968. So, Vasya's capital is V*(0.968)^U.Since U is the number of unsuccessful days, which is a positive integer (assuming they played for some time), then (0.968)^U is less than 1. Therefore, Vasya's capital is multiplied by a number less than 1, which means his capital has decreased.Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 1.1 squared is 1.21, correct. Then 1.21 multiplied by 0.8 is indeed 0.968. So, each unsuccessful day contributes a factor of 0.968 to Vasya's capital. So, regardless of how many days there are, as long as U is positive, Vasya's capital will be less than the initial V.But hold on, is that the case? Let me think again. So, if S = 2U, then for each unsuccessful day, there are two successful days. So, Vasya's capital is multiplied by 1.1 twice and 0.8 once each cycle of three days.Wait, so maybe instead of thinking of it as U cycles, it's better to think of each cycle of two successful days and one unsuccessful day.So, in each cycle, Vasya's capital changes by 1.1 * 1.1 * 0.8. Let me compute that: 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21, then 1.21 * 0.8 is 0.968. So, each cycle of two successful days and one unsuccessful day, Vasya's capital is multiplied by 0.968. So, each cycle reduces his capital by a factor of 0.968.Therefore, after multiple cycles, his capital will be V*(0.968)^n, where n is the number of cycles. Since 0.968 is less than 1, each cycle reduces his capital further. So, overall, Vasya's capital decreases.Wait, but is 0.968 the correct factor? Let me compute 1.1 * 1.1 * 0.8 again. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21, right? Then 1.21 * 0.8 is 0.968. Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the overall factor without breaking it into cycles. Since S = 2U, the total factor is (1.1)^{2U} * (0.8)^U = (1.1^2 * 0.8)^U = (1.21 * 0.8)^U = (0.968)^U. So, same result.Therefore, regardless of the number of cycles or days, Vasya's capital is multiplied by 0.968 raised to the number of unsuccessful days, which is a positive integer. So, Vasya's capital is less than the initial V.Therefore, Vasya's capital has decreased.But wait, let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe the days are not necessarily in cycles of two successful and one unsuccessful, but just that over some period, the number of successful days is twice the number of unsuccessful days.But regardless of the order, the multiplicative factors would still apply. So, whether the successful days come first or last, the overall factor is the product of all the daily factors.So, if S = 2U, then the total factor is (1.1)^{2U}*(0.8)^U = (1.1^2 * 0.8)^U = (1.21 * 0.8)^U = 0.968^U.So, regardless of the order, the total factor is 0.968^U, which is less than 1. Therefore, Vasya's capital is multiplied by a number less than 1, so it decreases.Therefore, the answer is that Vasya's capital decreased.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's compute 1.1 * 1.1 * 0.8 step by step.First, 1.1 * 1.1: 1.1 multiplied by 1.1 is 1.21. Then, 1.21 multiplied by 0.8: 1.21 * 0.8. Let's compute that.1 * 0.8 = 0.8, 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16, 0.01 * 0.8 = 0.008. So, adding those together: 0.8 + 0.16 = 0.96, plus 0.008 is 0.968. So, yes, that's correct.Therefore, each cycle of two successful days and one unsuccessful day reduces Vasya's capital by a factor of 0.968. So, over multiple such cycles, his capital continues to decrease.Hence, after some time, when Petya's capital returns to its initial state, Vasya's capital has decreased.Wait, but let me think about this again. Suppose Petya's capital returns to its initial state. So, Petya's net gain is zero. For Petya, each successful day gives +1000, each unsuccessful day gives -2000. So, over S successful days and U unsuccessful days, the total change is 1000*S - 2000*U = 0. So, S = 2U.Therefore, the number of successful days is twice the number of unsuccessful days.Therefore, for Vasya, each successful day is a 10% increase, each unsuccessful day is a 20% decrease.So, the total factor is (1.1)^S * (0.8)^U. Since S = 2U, substitute that in: (1.1)^{2U} * (0.8)^U = (1.1^2 * 0.8)^U = (1.21 * 0.8)^U = 0.968^U.So, 0.968 is less than 1, so 0.968^U is less than 1 for any positive integer U. Therefore, Vasya's capital is multiplied by a number less than 1, so it's less than the initial capital.Therefore, Vasya's capital has decreased.Wait, but let me think about this another way. Maybe using logarithms or something. Let me compute the overall growth rate.The overall growth factor is 0.968 per cycle. So, the growth rate per cycle is -3.2% approximately. So, each cycle, Vasya loses about 3.2% of his capital.Therefore, over multiple cycles, his capital decreases exponentially.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the ratio of Vasya's final capital to his initial capital.Let me denote V_final = V_initial * (1.1)^S * (0.8)^U.Since S = 2U, V_final = V_initial * (1.1)^{2U} * (0.8)^U.Which is V_initial * (1.21)^U * (0.8)^U = V_initial * (1.21 * 0.8)^U = V_initial * (0.968)^U.So, as U increases, V_final decreases.Therefore, regardless of the number of days, as long as U is positive, Vasya's capital is less than V_initial.Hence, Vasya's capital has decreased.Wait, but let me think if there's a case where U is zero. If U is zero, then S is also zero, meaning no days have passed, so Vasya's capital remains the same. But the problem says \\"after some time,\\" so U must be at least one, right? Because if no days have passed, it's not \\"after some time.\\"Therefore, U is at least one, so Vasya's capital is definitely less than the initial.Therefore, the answer is that Vasya's capital decreased.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I can use specific numbers to test this.Suppose Petya's initial capital is, say, 10,000. Let's pick a number that makes the math easy.If Petya has S successful days and U unsuccessful days, with S = 2U.Let's pick U = 1, so S = 2.So, Petya's capital after 2 successful days and 1 unsuccessful day: 10,000 + 1000*2 - 2000*1 = 10,000 + 2000 - 2000 = 10,000. So, back to initial.Now, Vasya's capital: Let's say Vasya's initial capital is also 10,000 for simplicity.After two successful days: 10,000 * 1.1 * 1.1 = 10,000 * 1.21 = 12,100.Then, after one unsuccessful day: 12,100 * 0.8 = 9,680.So, Vasya's capital is now 9,680, which is less than 10,000. So, it decreased.Alternatively, let's try with U = 2, so S = 4.Petya's capital: 10,000 + 1000*4 - 2000*2 = 10,000 + 4000 - 4000 = 10,000.Vasya's capital: 10,000 * (1.1)^4 * (0.8)^2.Compute (1.1)^4: 1.1^2 = 1.21, so 1.21^2 = 1.4641.(0.8)^2 = 0.64.So, total factor: 1.4641 * 0.64 ≈ 0.938.So, Vasya's capital is 10,000 * 0.938 = 9,380, which is even less.So, each time, Vasya's capital decreases.Therefore, it seems consistent that Vasya's capital decreases.Wait, but let me try with U = 3, S = 6.Petya's capital: 10,000 + 1000*6 - 2000*3 = 10,000 + 6000 - 6000 = 10,000.Vasya's capital: 10,000 * (1.1)^6 * (0.8)^3.Compute (1.1)^6: Let's compute step by step.1.1^2 = 1.211.21 * 1.1 = 1.331 (1.1^3)1.331 * 1.1 = 1.4641 (1.1^4)1.4641 * 1.1 = 1.61051 (1.1^5)1.61051 * 1.1 ≈ 1.771561 (1.1^6)(0.8)^3 = 0.512Multiply 1.771561 * 0.512 ≈ 0.906.So, Vasya's capital is 10,000 * 0.906 ≈ 9,060.Again, less than 10,000.So, each time, Vasya's capital is decreasing.Therefore, it's clear that Vasya's capital has decreased.Wait, but let me think about the general case. Suppose U is any positive integer, then Vasya's capital is multiplied by (0.968)^U, which is less than 1. So, regardless of how many cycles, as long as U is positive, Vasya's capital is less than initial.Therefore, the answer is that Vasya's capital decreased.But wait, let me think about the multiplicative factors again. Maybe I can compute the overall growth rate.The overall growth factor per cycle (two successful days and one unsuccessful day) is 1.1 * 1.1 * 0.8 = 0.968, as we saw.So, each cycle reduces Vasya's capital by approximately 3.2%.Therefore, over multiple cycles, the capital decreases exponentially.Hence, Vasya's capital has decreased.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the ratio of Vasya's final capital to his initial capital.Let me denote R = (1.1)^{2U} * (0.8)^U.Which is equal to (1.1^2 * 0.8)^U = (1.21 * 0.8)^U = 0.968^U.Since 0.968 < 1, R < 1 for any U > 0.Therefore, Vasya's capital is R times his initial capital, which is less than initial.Hence, Vasya's capital has decreased.Wait, but let me think about the problem again. It says \\"after some time,\\" so it's not necessarily that the number of days is a multiple of 3 (i.e., S = 2U). But from Petya's perspective, the total change is zero, so 1000*S - 2000*U = 0, which implies S = 2U. So, regardless of how the days are arranged, the number of successful days must be twice the number of unsuccessful days.Therefore, the total factor for Vasya is (1.1)^{2U}*(0.8)^U = 0.968^U, which is less than 1.Therefore, Vasya's capital is less than initial.Hence, the answer is that Vasya's capital decreased.I think I've thought through this problem thoroughly, considering different angles and even testing with specific numbers. Each time, the conclusion is the same: Vasya's capital has decreased.**Final Answer**boxed{text{decreased}}"},{"question":"Simplify first, then evaluate: (2y+3x^{2})-(x^{2}-y)-x^{2}, where x=-2 and y=frac{1}{3}.","answer":"First, I need to simplify the expression ((2y + 3x^2) - (x^2 - y) - x^2).I'll start by distributing the negative sign through the second parenthesis:(2y + 3x^2 - x^2 + y - x^2).Next, I'll combine like terms.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when a train is braking, it's decelerating, which means its velocity is decreasing until it reaches zero. So, to find out when the train stops, I need to find the time t when the velocity becomes zero.Velocity is the derivative of the position function with respect to time. So, if I take the derivative of S with respect to t, that should give me the velocity function. Let me compute that.The position function is S = 27t - 0.45t². Taking the derivative term by term:- The derivative of 27t with respect to t is 27.- The derivative of -0.45t² with respect to t is -0.9t.So, putting that together, the velocity function v(t) is 27 - 0.9t.Now, to find when the train stops, I need to find the time t when the velocity is zero. So, I'll set v(t) equal to zero and solve for t.0 = 27 - 0.9tLet me solve for t:0.9t = 27t = 27 / 0.9Hmm, calculating that. 27 divided by 0.9. Let me see, 0.9 goes into 27 how many times? Well, 0.9 times 30 is 27, right? Because 0.9 times 10 is 9, so 0.9 times 30 is 27. So, t = 30 seconds.Okay, so the train stops after 30 seconds. That seems straightforward.Now, I need to find out how far the train travels during this braking period. So, I need to compute the distance S when t = 30 seconds.The position function is S = 27t - 0.45t². Plugging t = 30 into this equation:S = 27*(30) - 0.45*(30)²Let me compute each term step by step.First, 27 multiplied by 30. 27*30 is 810.Next, 0.45 multiplied by (30) squared. 30 squared is 900, so 0.45*900. Let me compute that. 0.45 times 900. 0.45 is the same as 45/100, so 45/100 * 900 = (45*900)/100.Calculating 45*900: 45*9 is 405, so 45*900 is 40500. Then, 40500 divided by 100 is 405. So, 0.45*900 is 405.Therefore, S = 810 - 405 = 405 meters.Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations.First, 27*30: 27*10 is 270, so 27*30 is 810. That's correct.Then, 0.45*30²: 30 squared is 900. 0.45*900: 0.45*900 is indeed 405. So, 810 - 405 is 405. Hmm, okay, so that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way to confirm.Alternatively, since the velocity function is v(t) = 27 - 0.9t, and we know that the train comes to a stop at t = 30, the distance traveled can also be found by integrating the velocity function from t = 0 to t = 30.Wait, but integrating velocity gives us the position, which is exactly what S(t) is. So, S(30) is 405 meters, which matches.Alternatively, maybe I can use another method, like finding the area under the velocity-time graph, which is a straight line from t=0 to t=30, starting at 27 m/s and decreasing linearly to 0 m/s.The area under the velocity-time graph is the distance traveled, which is a triangle in this case. The base of the triangle is 30 seconds, and the height is 27 m/s. So, area = (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*30*27.Calculating that: 30*27 = 810, then half of that is 405. So, that also gives 405 meters. So, that confirms it.Therefore, the train stops after 30 seconds and travels 405 meters during this period.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the steps again.First, derivative of S(t) is v(t) = 27 - 0.9t. Setting that equal to zero: 27 - 0.9t = 0, so 0.9t = 27, t = 27 / 0.9 = 30 seconds. That seems correct.Then, plugging t = 30 into S(t): 27*30 = 810, 0.45*(30)^2 = 0.45*900 = 405, so 810 - 405 = 405 meters. Yep, that's consistent.Alternatively, using the formula for distance under constant acceleration: since the train is decelerating uniformly, the average velocity is (initial velocity + final velocity)/2. Initial velocity is 27 m/s, final velocity is 0, so average velocity is 13.5 m/s. Then, distance is average velocity multiplied by time: 13.5 m/s * 30 s = 405 meters. That also gives the same result.So, all methods point to the same answer: 30 seconds and 405 meters.Therefore, I can confidently say that the train stops after 30 seconds and travels 405 meters during the braking period.**Final Answer**The train stops after boxed{30} seconds, and during this period, the train travels boxed{405} meters."},{"question":"The rabbits sawed several logs. They made 10 cuts and obtained 16 pieces. How many logs did they saw?","answer":"First, I need to determine how many logs the rabbits sawed. They made a total of 10 cuts and ended up with 16 pieces.I know that each cut on a single log increases the number of pieces by one. So, if a log has ( c ) cuts, it will result in ( c + 1 ) pieces.Let’s assume there are ( L ) logs. Each log contributes ( c_i ) cuts, where ( i ) ranges from 1 to ( L ). The total number of cuts is the sum of all individual cuts:[sum_{i=1}^{L} c_i = 10]The total number of pieces is the sum of all pieces from each log:[sum_{i=1}^{L} (c_i + 1) = 16]Simplifying the pieces equation:[sum_{i=1}^{L} c_i + L = 16]Substituting the total cuts into the equation:[10 + L = 16]Solving for ( L ):[L = 6]Therefore, the rabbits sawed 6 logs."},{"question":"Given the sequence {a_n}, where the sum of the first n terms, S_n = n^2 + n + 1, find the value of a_8 + a_9 + a_10 + a_11 + a_12.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm given a sequence {a_n}, and the sum of the first n terms is S_n = n² + n + 1. I need to find the value of a₈ + a₉ + a₁₀ + a₁₁ + a₁₂. Hmm, that seems like it involves figuring out the individual terms of the sequence and then adding them up from the 8th to the 12th term. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the sum of the first n terms, S_n, is related to the individual terms a_n. Specifically, each term a_n can be found by subtracting the sum of the first (n-1) terms from the sum of the first n terms. In other words, a_n = S_n - S_{n-1}. That makes sense because S_n is the total up to n, and S_{n-1} is the total up to n-1, so their difference should be the nth term.So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, I can then plug in n = 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and add them up. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute the sum from a₈ to a₁₂ without finding each term individually. Let me explore both options.First, let me try to find a general expression for a_n. Since S_n = n² + n + 1, then S_{n-1} would be (n-1)² + (n-1) + 1. Let me compute that:S_{n-1} = (n-1)² + (n-1) + 1= (n² - 2n + 1) + (n - 1) + 1= n² - 2n + 1 + n - 1 + 1= n² - n + 1So, a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = (n² + n + 1) - (n² - n + 1)Let me compute that:= n² + n + 1 - n² + n - 1= (n² - n²) + (n + n) + (1 - 1)= 0 + 2n + 0= 2nWait, so a_n = 2n? That seems too simple. Let me check for n=1. If n=1, then S₁ = 1² + 1 + 1 = 3. So, a₁ should be 3. But according to a_n = 2n, a₁ would be 2(1) = 2. That's not matching. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.Let me go back. S_n = n² + n + 1, so S_{n-1} should be (n-1)² + (n-1) + 1.Compute S_{n-1}:= (n-1)² + (n-1) + 1= (n² - 2n + 1) + (n - 1) + 1= n² - 2n + 1 + n - 1 + 1= n² - n + 1Wait, that seems correct. Then S_n - S_{n-1} is:= (n² + n + 1) - (n² - n + 1)= n² + n + 1 - n² + n - 1= 2nBut as I saw, for n=1, a₁ should be 3, but 2n gives 2. So, there must be something wrong here.Wait, maybe the formula a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} is only valid for n ≥ 2? Because for n=1, S₀ is not defined, or is it?Wait, actually, S₀ is the sum of zero terms, which is 0. So, if n=1, a₁ = S₁ - S₀ = (1 + 1 + 1) - 0 = 3, which is correct. But according to the formula a_n = 2n, when n=1, it's 2, which is incorrect. So, maybe the formula a_n = 2n is only valid for n ≥ 2, and a₁ is a special case.Let me check for n=2. S₂ = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. So, a₂ = S₂ - S₁ = 7 - 3 = 4. According to a_n = 2n, a₂ = 4, which is correct. Similarly, a₃ = S₃ - S₂. S₃ = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. So, a₃ = 13 - 7 = 6, which is 2*3=6, correct. So, it seems that for n ≥ 2, a_n = 2n, but for n=1, a₁=3.So, in general, the sequence is:a₁ = 3a_n = 2n for n ≥ 2So, that explains the discrepancy. So, when n=1, it's 3, and for n≥2, it's 2n.Therefore, to compute a₈ + a₉ + a₁₀ + a₁₁ + a₁₂, since all these terms are for n ≥ 2, we can use a_n = 2n for each of them.So, let's compute each term:a₈ = 2*8 = 16a₉ = 2*9 = 18a₁₀ = 2*10 = 20a₁₁ = 2*11 = 22a₁₂ = 2*12 = 24Now, adding them up:16 + 18 = 3434 + 20 = 5454 + 22 = 7676 + 24 = 100So, the sum is 100.Alternatively, maybe I can find the sum from a₈ to a₁₂ by using the sum formula S_n.Wait, since S_n is the sum of the first n terms, then the sum from a₈ to a₁₂ is equal to S₁₂ - S₇.Because S₁₂ is the sum up to 12, and S₇ is the sum up to 7, so subtracting them gives the sum from 8 to 12.Let me compute that:S₁₂ = 12² + 12 + 1 = 144 + 12 + 1 = 157S₇ = 7² + 7 + 1 = 49 + 7 + 1 = 57So, S₁₂ - S₇ = 157 - 57 = 100Same result as before. So, that confirms that the sum is 100.Therefore, the value of a₈ + a₉ + a₁₀ + a₁₁ + a₁₂ is 100.**Final Answer**The value of (a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12}) is boxed{100}."},{"question":"If the graph of the power function y=f(x) passes through the point (9,3), then the value of f(25) is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"If the graph of the power function ( y = f(x) ) passes through the point ( (9, 3) ), then the value of ( f(25) ) is ______.\\" Hmm, power function... I remember that power functions are of the form ( f(x) = kx^n ), where ( k ) and ( n ) are constants. So, I need to find ( f(25) ), but first, I need to figure out what ( k ) and ( n ) are.The graph passes through ( (9, 3) ), which means when ( x = 9 ), ( y = 3 ). So, plugging that into the power function equation, I get:( 3 = k cdot 9^n )But wait, that's just one equation with two unknowns, ( k ) and ( n ). I need another equation to solve for both. Hmm, maybe I can assume something about the function? Or perhaps there's another point I can use? Wait, the problem doesn't give another point, so maybe I need to figure out ( n ) another way.Wait, power functions can also be written as ( y = kx^n ), and sometimes they pass through the origin unless ( n ) is negative. But in this case, since it passes through ( (9, 3) ), which isn't the origin, so ( k ) can't be zero. Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, maybe I can express ( k ) in terms of ( n ) from the equation ( 3 = k cdot 9^n ). Let me solve for ( k ):( k = frac{3}{9^n} )So, ( k = 3 cdot 9^{-n} ). Hmm, okay, so now the function is ( f(x) = 3 cdot 9^{-n} cdot x^n ). Maybe I can simplify this expression.Wait, ( 9 ) is ( 3^2 ), so ( 9^{-n} = (3^2)^{-n} = 3^{-2n} ). So, substituting back, ( f(x) = 3 cdot 3^{-2n} cdot x^n = 3^{1 - 2n} cdot x^n ).Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I need another approach. Since it's a power function, maybe it's a square root function or something. Wait, power functions can have any exponent, positive or negative, integer or fractional.Wait, let me think. If ( f(x) = kx^n ), and it passes through ( (9, 3) ), then ( 3 = k cdot 9^n ). Maybe I can take logarithms to solve for ( n ). Let me try that.Taking natural logarithm on both sides:( ln(3) = ln(k cdot 9^n) )Using logarithm properties, ( ln(ab) = ln a + ln b ), so:( ln(3) = ln(k) + ln(9^n) )And ( ln(9^n) = n ln(9) ), so:( ln(3) = ln(k) + n ln(9) )But I still have two unknowns here, ( ln(k) ) and ( n ). Hmm, so I can't solve for both with just this equation. Maybe I need another condition? But the problem doesn't provide another point. Hmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption.Wait, maybe the function is a square root function? Because ( sqrt{9} = 3 ), so perhaps ( f(x) = sqrt{x} ). Let me check: if ( f(9) = sqrt{9} = 3 ), which matches the given point. So, is ( f(x) = sqrt{x} ) a power function? Yes, because ( sqrt{x} = x^{1/2} ), which is a power function with ( k = 1 ) and ( n = 1/2 ).So, if that's the case, then ( f(x) = x^{1/2} ), so ( f(25) = sqrt{25} = 5 ). So, is the answer 5? Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps.Wait, but is ( f(x) = sqrt{x} ) the only power function that passes through ( (9, 3) )? Or are there other possibilities? Because power functions can have different exponents. For example, ( f(x) = kx^n ), so if I choose different ( n ), I can get different ( k ) values.Wait, for example, if ( n = 1 ), then ( f(x) = kx ), and plugging in ( x = 9 ), ( 3 = 9k ), so ( k = 1/3 ). Then ( f(25) = (1/3)(25) = 25/3 approx 8.333 ). So, that's a different answer.Alternatively, if ( n = 2 ), then ( f(x) = kx^2 ), so ( 3 = k cdot 81 ), so ( k = 3/81 = 1/27 ). Then ( f(25) = (1/27)(625) = 625/27 approx 23.148 ). Hmm, so depending on ( n ), the value of ( f(25) ) changes.But the problem says \\"the power function\\", implying that it's uniquely determined? Or is there something else?Wait, maybe the problem assumes that it's a monomial function, but without more information, I can't determine both ( k ) and ( n ). So, perhaps the problem expects a specific form, like square root, because it's a common power function.Wait, let me check the problem again: \\"If the graph of the power function ( y = f(x) ) passes through the point ( (9, 3) ), then the value of ( f(25) ) is ______.\\" It doesn't specify anything else, so maybe it's expecting the simplest power function, which is the square root function.Alternatively, maybe it's a linear function, but that would be a power function with ( n = 1 ), which I already considered. But without more information, I can't be sure.Wait, maybe I can think of the function as ( f(x) = x^n ), meaning ( k = 1 ). Let's see if that works. If ( f(9) = 9^n = 3 ), then ( 9^n = 3 ). Since ( 9 = 3^2 ), so ( (3^2)^n = 3^{2n} = 3^1 ). Therefore, ( 2n = 1 ), so ( n = 1/2 ). So, ( f(x) = x^{1/2} = sqrt{x} ). So, that gives ( f(25) = 5 ). So, that seems consistent.So, if the power function is of the form ( f(x) = x^n ), then ( n = 1/2 ), and ( f(25) = 5 ). But if the power function is of the form ( f(x) = kx^n ), with ( k ) not necessarily 1, then there are infinitely many solutions, as I saw earlier.But the problem says \\"the power function\\", which might imply that it's a monomial function with ( k = 1 ). Or maybe it's expecting the simplest form, which would be the square root function.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the function is of the form ( f(x) = sqrt{x} ), so ( f(25) = 5 ). That seems plausible.Wait, let me think again. If ( f(x) = kx^n ), and it passes through ( (9, 3) ), then ( 3 = k cdot 9^n ). Without another point, we can't uniquely determine ( k ) and ( n ). So, unless there's an assumption that ( k = 1 ), which would make ( n = 1/2 ), but the problem doesn't specify that.Hmm, so maybe I need to make an assumption here. Since the problem is asking for ( f(25) ), and it's a power function, perhaps it's expecting the simplest case, which is the square root function, giving ( f(25) = 5 ).Alternatively, maybe the function is linear, but that would be ( f(x) = (1/3)x ), so ( f(25) = 25/3 ). But that's a different answer.Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the function to be ( f(x) = x^{1/2} ), so ( f(25) = 5 ). That seems more likely, especially since ( 9 ) and ( 3 ) are perfect squares and square roots.Alternatively, maybe the function is ( f(x) = x^{1/2} ), so ( f(25) = 5 ). Yeah, that seems to make sense.Wait, let me verify. If ( f(x) = x^{1/2} ), then ( f(9) = 3 ), which is correct. So, that works. So, ( f(25) = 5 ).Alternatively, if the function is ( f(x) = 3 cdot (x/9)^{1/2} ), which is another way to write ( f(x) = sqrt{x} ). So, that also gives ( f(25) = 5 ).Wait, but if I don't assume ( k = 1 ), then ( k ) could be any value, as long as ( 3 = k cdot 9^n ). So, without another condition, I can't determine ( k ) and ( n ) uniquely. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the simplest case, where ( k = 1 ), leading to ( n = 1/2 ), so ( f(25) = 5 ).Alternatively, maybe the function is a square function, but that would be ( f(x) = x^2 ), which would give ( f(9) = 81 ), which is not 3, so that's not it.Wait, another thought: maybe the function is ( f(x) = x^{1/2} ), which is the square root function, so ( f(25) = 5 ). That seems consistent.Alternatively, if I consider ( f(x) = x^{-1} ), then ( f(9) = 1/9 ), which is not 3, so that's not it.Wait, maybe ( f(x) = x^{1/3} ), then ( f(9) = 9^{1/3} approx 2.08 ), which is not 3, so that's not it either.Alternatively, ( f(x) = x^{2} ), but as I saw earlier, that gives ( f(9) = 81 ), which is too big.Wait, so the only exponent that gives ( f(9) = 3 ) is ( n = 1/2 ), because ( 9^{1/2} = 3 ). So, if ( k = 1 ), then ( f(x) = x^{1/2} ), which gives ( f(25) = 5 ).Alternatively, if ( k ) is not 1, but ( k cdot 9^n = 3 ), then ( k = 3 cdot 9^{-n} ). So, ( f(x) = 3 cdot 9^{-n} cdot x^n ). Then, ( f(25) = 3 cdot 9^{-n} cdot 25^n ).Hmm, that's a bit more complicated. Let me see if I can express this in terms of 3 and 5.Since ( 9 = 3^2 ) and ( 25 = 5^2 ), so ( 9^{-n} = (3^2)^{-n} = 3^{-2n} ) and ( 25^n = (5^2)^n = 5^{2n} ). So, substituting back:( f(25) = 3 cdot 3^{-2n} cdot 5^{2n} = 3^{1 - 2n} cdot 5^{2n} ).Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor out the exponent:( f(25) = (3^{1 - 2n} cdot 5^{2n}) = 3 cdot (5^{2n} / 3^{2n}) = 3 cdot (5/3)^{2n} ).But without knowing ( n ), I can't compute this further. So, unless I have another condition, I can't find a numerical value for ( f(25) ).Wait, but the problem is asking for a numerical value, so maybe it's expecting the simplest case where ( k = 1 ), so ( n = 1/2 ), giving ( f(25) = 5 ).Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the function is ( f(x) = sqrt{x} ), so ( f(25) = 5 ).Wait, another approach: maybe the function is linear, but that would be ( f(x) = (1/3)x ), so ( f(25) = 25/3 ). But that's a different answer.Wait, but if the function is linear, it's a power function with ( n = 1 ), so ( f(x) = kx ). Then, ( 3 = 9k ), so ( k = 1/3 ). So, ( f(25) = (1/3)(25) = 25/3 ). So, that's another possibility.But without more information, I can't determine whether it's ( n = 1/2 ) or ( n = 1 ). So, maybe the problem is expecting the square root function, which is a common power function.Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the function is of the form ( f(x) = x^n ), so ( k = 1 ), leading to ( n = 1/2 ), so ( f(25) = 5 ).Wait, let me check the definition of a power function. A power function is of the form ( f(x) = kx^n ), where ( k ) and ( n ) are constants. So, ( k ) can be any constant, not necessarily 1.Therefore, without another point, we can't uniquely determine ( k ) and ( n ). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the simplest case where ( k = 1 ), so ( n = 1/2 ), giving ( f(25) = 5 ).Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the function to be ( f(x) = sqrt{x} ), which is a power function, so ( f(25) = 5 ).Wait, but if I consider ( f(x) = x^{1/2} ), then ( f(9) = 3 ), which matches the given point, so that seems correct.Alternatively, if I consider ( f(x) = x^{1/2} ), then ( f(25) = 5 ). So, that seems consistent.Wait, but if I don't assume ( k = 1 ), then ( k ) could be any value, as long as ( 3 = k cdot 9^n ). So, for example, if ( n = 1 ), then ( k = 1/3 ), and ( f(25) = 25/3 ). If ( n = 2 ), then ( k = 1/27 ), and ( f(25) = 625/27 ).

The key is that without another point, we can't uniquely determine both ( k ) and ( n ). However, the problem is asking for a specific value, so it's likely expecting the simplest case where ( k = 1 ), leading to ( n = 1/2 ), so ( f(25) = 5 ).Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the function to be ( f(x) = sqrt{x} ), which is a power function, so ( f(25) = 5 ).Wait, but let me think again.

The function is given by f(n) = tan(n/2 * π + π/4). Hmm, let me try to understand this step by step.First, let's write down the function again to make sure I have it right: f(n) = tan((n/2)π + π/4). So, for each natural number n starting from 0, I plug it into this tangent function. My goal is to sum all these values from n=0 up to n=2015. That's a lot of terms, so I need to see if there's a pattern or periodicity in the function f(n) that can help me simplify the sum.I remember that the tangent function has a period of π, which means tan(x + π) = tan(x). So, maybe if I can find the period of f(n), I can figure out how many terms repeat and then compute the sum over one period and multiply by the number of periods in 2016 terms (since we start at n=0).Let's analyze the argument of the tangent function: (n/2)π + π/4. Let me rewrite this as (π/2)(n) + π/4. Hmm, so each increment of n by 1 increases the argument by π/2. That means the function f(n) = tan((n/2)π + π/4) increases its argument by π/2 each time. Since the period of tangent is π, but here the argument is increasing by π/2 each step, so the function might have a period of 2. Let me check that.Let's compute f(n + 2) and see if it equals f(n). So, f(n + 2) = tan(((n + 2)/2)π + π/4) = tan((n/2 + 1)π + π/4). Let's simplify this: tan((n/2)π + π + π/4) = tan((n/2)π + 5π/4). Now, tan(x + π) = tan(x), so tan((n/2)π + 5π/4) = tan((n/2)π + π/4). So, f(n + 2) = f(n). That means the function f(n) is periodic with period 2. So, every two terms, the function repeats its values.Therefore, if I can find the sum over one period, which is two terms, and then multiply by the number of periods in 2016 terms, that should give me the total sum. Let's compute f(0) and f(1), which are the two terms in one period.Compute f(0): tan((0/2)π + π/4) = tan(0 + π/4) = tan(π/4). I know that tan(π/4) is 1. So, f(0) = 1.Compute f(1): tan((1/2)π + π/4) = tan(π/2 + π/4). Wait, π/2 + π/4 is 3π/4. So, tan(3π/4). I remember that tan(3π/4) is -1 because it's in the second quadrant where tangent is negative, and tan(π - π/4) = -tan(π/4) = -1. So, f(1) = -1.So, over one period (n=0 and n=1), the sum is f(0) + f(1) = 1 + (-1) = 0. That's interesting. So, every two terms, the sum cancels out to zero. If that's the case, then the entire sum from n=0 to n=2015 would be zero, right? Because 2016 terms (from 0 to 2015 inclusive) can be divided into 1008 periods of two terms each, each summing to zero. So, 1008 * 0 = 0.Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should compute a few more terms to see if the pattern holds.Compute f(2): tan((2/2)π + π/4) = tan(π + π/4) = tan(5π/4). Tan(5π/4) is 1 because it's in the third quadrant where tangent is positive, and tan(π + π/4) = tan(π/4) = 1. So, f(2) = 1.Compute f(3): tan((3/2)π + π/4) = tan(3π/2 + π/4). Wait, 3π/2 + π/4 is 7π/4. Tan(7π/4) is -1 because it's in the fourth quadrant where tangent is negative, and tan(2π - π/4) = -tan(π/4) = -1. So, f(3) = -1.So, f(2) = 1 and f(3) = -1, which is the same as f(0) and f(1). So, the pattern indeed repeats every two terms: 1, -1, 1, -1, etc. So, every pair of terms adds up to zero.Therefore, since we have 2016 terms (from n=0 to n=2015), which is an even number, we can divide it into 1008 pairs, each summing to zero. Therefore, the total sum should be zero.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that the function is indeed periodic with period 2 for all n. Because sometimes, when dealing with trigonometric functions, especially tangent, there can be issues with undefined points or asymptotes. Let me check if any of the terms in the function f(n) are undefined.The tangent function is undefined at odd multiples of π/2, i.e., at (2k + 1)π/2 for integer k. So, let's see if any of the arguments of the tangent function in f(n) are equal to (2k + 1)π/2.The argument is (n/2)π + π/4. Let's set this equal to (2k + 1)π/2 and solve for n:(n/2)π + π/4 = (2k + 1)π/2Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:2nπ + π = 2(2k + 1)πSimplify:2nπ + π = (4k + 2)πSubtract π from both sides:2nπ = (4k + 1)πDivide both sides by π:2n = 4k + 1So, 2n = 4k + 1 => n = (4k + 1)/2But n is a natural number (including zero), so n must be an integer. However, (4k + 1)/2 is not an integer because 4k is even, 4k + 1 is odd, and dividing an odd number by 2 gives a non-integer. Therefore, there are no natural numbers n for which f(n) is undefined. So, all terms in the sum are defined.Therefore, my initial conclusion stands: the function f(n) is periodic with period 2, each period sums to zero, and since 2016 is divisible by 2, the entire sum is zero.But just to be thorough, let me compute the sum for a small number of terms and see if it holds.Compute sum from n=0 to n=1: f(0) + f(1) = 1 + (-1) = 0.Sum from n=0 to n=3: f(0) + f(1) + f(2) + f(3) = 1 -1 +1 -1 = 0.Sum from n=0 to n=5: 1 -1 +1 -1 +1 -1 = 0.So, it seems consistent that every even number of terms sums to zero. Therefore, for 2016 terms, the sum is zero.Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the starting point. The problem says n ∈ ℕ*, which usually means positive integers, but sometimes it can include zero. Wait, in the problem statement, it's specified as n ∈ ℕ*, which is the set of positive integers, so n starts at 1. Wait, hold on, the problem says n ∈ ℕ*, which is typically {1, 2, 3, ...}, but in the sum, it's written as f(0) + f(1) + ... + f(2015). So, the function is defined for n ∈ ℕ*, but the sum includes n=0. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.Wait, let me check the original problem again: \\"If the function f(n) = tan(n/2 π + π/4) (n ∈ ℕ*), find the value of f(0) + f(1) + f(2) + … + f(2015) = ______.\\"So, the function is defined for n in ℕ*, which is {1, 2, 3, ...}, but the sum includes n=0. So, is f(0) defined? Because n=0 is not in ℕ*. Hmm, that's a problem because f(0) is not in the domain of the function as defined.Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \\"If the function f(n) = tan(n/2 π + π/4) (n ∈ ℕ*), find the value of f(0) + f(1) + f(2) + … + f(2015) = ______.\\"So, the function is defined for n ∈ ℕ*, but the sum includes n=0. So, is f(0) defined? Or is there a typo?Alternatively, maybe the function is defined for n ∈ ℕ, which includes zero, but the problem says ℕ*. So, perhaps the problem has a typo, or maybe f(0) is still defined even though n ∈ ℕ*. Hmm.Wait, in mathematics, ℕ* usually denotes the set of positive integers, i.e., {1, 2, 3, ...}, whereas ℕ includes zero. So, if the function is defined for n ∈ ℕ*, then f(0) is not defined. But the problem is asking for the sum from n=0 to n=2015, which includes f(0). That seems contradictory.Is it possible that the problem actually meant n ∈ ℕ, including zero? Or maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps f(0) is defined even though n ∈ ℕ*. Hmm.Wait, perhaps the function is defined for n ∈ ℕ*, but the sum is still over n=0 to 2015, so maybe f(0) is just an additional term outside the function's domain. But that would mean f(0) is undefined, which can't be part of the sum. So, perhaps the problem actually meant n ∈ ℕ, including zero.Alternatively, maybe the function is defined for all integers n, but the problem restricts n to ℕ*. Hmm.Wait, perhaps I should proceed assuming that f(0) is defined, even though n ∈ ℕ*. Maybe the problem just wants us to compute f(0) regardless of the domain. Alternatively, perhaps the function is defined for all integers n, including zero, but the problem mistakenly wrote ℕ* instead of ℕ.Given that, since the problem is asking for f(0) + f(1) + ... + f(2015), I think it's safe to assume that f(0) is defined, even if the function is stated for n ∈ ℕ*. So, perhaps the problem has a typo, and we should proceed accordingly.Alternatively, maybe the function is defined for n ∈ ℕ, including zero, and the problem mistakenly wrote ℕ*. In any case, since the sum includes f(0), I need to compute it.But earlier, I computed f(0) as 1, which is correct because tan(π/4) is 1. So, regardless of the domain, f(0) is 1.Therefore, proceeding with the sum from n=0 to n=2015, which includes 2016 terms, each pair of terms (n even and n odd) summing to zero. So, the total sum is zero.Wait, but let me confirm once more. If n=0 is included, then the sum is from n=0 to n=2015, which is 2016 terms. Since the function is periodic with period 2, and each period sums to zero, then the total sum is zero.But just to make sure, let me compute the sum for n=0 to n=1: 1 + (-1) = 0.n=0 to n=2: 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.Wait, hold on, that's different. Wait, no, n=0 to n=2 is three terms: f(0)=1, f(1)=-1, f(2)=1. So, sum is 1 -1 +1 = 1.Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, if I have an odd number of terms, the sum is not zero. But in our case, we have 2016 terms, which is even, so it should be zero.Wait, let me clarify. The period is 2, so every two terms sum to zero. So, if the number of terms is even, the sum is zero. If it's odd, it's equal to the first term of the next period, which is 1.So, in our case, 2016 is even, so the sum is zero. But if I had, say, 2015 terms, which is odd, the sum would be 1.Wait, let me test this with n=0 to n=3: 1 -1 +1 -1 = 0. That's four terms, which is even, so sum is zero.n=0 to n=1: two terms, sum zero.n=0 to n=2: three terms, sum 1.n=0 to n=4: five terms, sum 1.Wait, no, n=0 to n=4 is five terms: 1 -1 +1 -1 +1 = 1.Wait, so when the number of terms is even, the sum is zero, and when it's odd, the sum is 1.But in our problem, the number of terms is 2016, which is even, so the sum is zero.Wait, but earlier when I thought of n=0 to n=2, which is three terms, the sum is 1, which is the same as f(0). So, in general, for an odd number of terms, the sum is f(0), which is 1.Therefore, in our case, since 2016 is even, the sum is zero.Therefore, the answer should be zero.But just to make sure, let me think about the general formula. If the function has period 2, then the sum over k periods is k*(f(0) + f(1)) = k*(1 -1) = 0.Since 2016 is 2*1008, so 1008 periods, each summing to zero, so total sum is zero.Therefore, the answer is zero.**Final Answer**boxed{0}"},{"question":"Given overrightarrow{AB}=(2,3),overrightarrow{BC}=(3,t), where t gt 0. If |overrightarrow{BC}|=sqrt{10}, then overrightarrow{AB}•overrightarrow{AC}=______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this vector problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says: Given vector AB is (2,3) and vector BC is (3,t), where t is greater than 0. It also mentions that the magnitude of vector BC is the square root of 10. Then, we need to find the dot product of vectors AB and AC. Hmm, okay.Let me write down what I know:- Vector AB = (2, 3)- Vector BC = (3, t)- |BC| = sqrt(10)- t > 0We need to find AB • AC.Alright, so first, maybe I should find the value of t since it's given that the magnitude of BC is sqrt(10). That should help me figure out vector BC completely.The magnitude of a vector (a, b) is sqrt(a² + b²). So, applying that to vector BC:|BC| = sqrt(3² + t²) = sqrt(9 + t²)But we know that |BC| is sqrt(10), so:sqrt(9 + t²) = sqrt(10)If I square both sides to eliminate the square roots:9 + t² = 10Subtract 9 from both sides:t² = 1Since t > 0, t must be 1. So, vector BC is (3,1).Alright, that's straightforward. Now, moving on to finding vector AC. Hmm, how do I get vector AC?I remember that vector AC can be found by adding vectors AB and BC because in a triangle, the vector from A to C is the sum of vectors AB and BC. So, AC = AB + BC.Let me write that down:AC = AB + BC = (2, 3) + (3, 1) = (2 + 3, 3 + 1) = (5, 4)So, vector AC is (5,4). Got that.Now, the problem asks for the dot product of AB and AC. The dot product of two vectors (a, b) and (c, d) is calculated as a*c + b*d.So, let's compute AB • AC:AB • AC = (2, 3) • (5, 4) = (2*5) + (3*4) = 10 + 12 = 22Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Calculated t correctly? Yes, because sqrt(9 + t²) = sqrt(10) leads to t² = 1, so t = 1 since t > 0.2. Found vector AC correctly? Yes, because AC is AB + BC, which is (2+3, 3+1) = (5,4).3. Calculated the dot product correctly? 2*5 is 10, 3*4 is 12, so 10 + 12 is 22. That seems right.Hmm, maybe I should visualize this to make sure. Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind.Point A, then moving to B with vector AB=(2,3), so from A, moving 2 units right and 3 units up. Then from B, moving to C with vector BC=(3,1), so 3 units right and 1 unit up. So, from A to C, it's 2+3=5 right and 3+1=4 up, which is vector AC=(5,4). That seems correct.Alternatively, I can think in terms of coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to points A, B, and C.Let me assume point A is at (0,0). Then, vector AB=(2,3) would take us to point B at (2,3). Then, vector BC=(3,1) would take us from B to C, so point C would be at (2+3, 3+1) = (5,4). So, vector AC is from A(0,0) to C(5,4), which is indeed (5,4). Perfect, that matches.So, the dot product AB • AC is 22. Hmm, seems solid.Wait, just to make sure, let me recall the formula for the dot product. It's the sum of the products of the corresponding components. So, yes, (2)(5) + (3)(4) = 10 + 12 = 22. Yep, that's correct.I think I've got this.

For example, the first equation is symmetric in x and y, the second in y and z, and the third in z and x. That might be useful.

Doesn't give new info.Hmm, so perhaps I need to find T.Wait, since T = x + y + z, and I have expressions for z - y, x - z, y - x in terms of T.Let me denote:Let me write:From Equation (5): (z - y = 25 / T)  -- (5)From Equation (6): (x - z = 2 / T)    -- (6)From Equation (7): (y - x = -27 / T)  -- (7)So, let's denote:Let me express x, y, z in terms of y and T.From Equation (5): z = y + 25 / TFrom Equation (6): x = z + 2 / T = y + 25 / T + 2 / T = y + 27 / TFrom Equation (7): y = x - 27 / T = (y + 27 / T) - 27 / T = yAgain, same result.Alternatively, let me express all variables in terms of T.Let me assume that T is known, then:From Equation (5): z = y + 25 / TFrom Equation (6): x = z + 2 / T = y + 25 / T + 2 / T = y + 27 / TFrom Equation (7): y = x - 27 / T = (y + 27 / T) - 27 / T = ySo, again, same thing.Alternatively, maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of T and then plug into T = x + y + z.Let me try that.From above:z = y + 25 / Tx = y + 27 / TSo, T = x + y + z = (y + 27 / T) + y + (y + 25 / T) = 3y + (27 + 25)/T = 3y + 52 / TSo, T = 3y + 52 / TLet me solve for y:Multiply both sides by T:(T^2 = 3y T + 52)So, (3y T = T^2 - 52)Thus, (y = (T^2 - 52) / (3T))Okay, so y is expressed in terms of T.Similarly, from above:x = y + 27 / T = [(T^2 - 52)/(3T)] + 27 / T = (T^2 - 52 + 81) / (3T) = (T^2 + 29) / (3T)Similarly, z = y + 25 / T = [(T^2 - 52)/(3T)] + 25 / T = (T^2 - 52 + 75) / (3T) = (T^2 + 23) / (3T)So now, x, y, z are all expressed in terms of T:x = (T^2 + 29)/(3T)y = (T^2 - 52)/(3T)z = (T^2 + 23)/(3T)Now, since x, y, z are positive, the numerators must be positive.So,For y: (T^2 - 52 > 0) => (T^2 > 52) => (T > sqrt{52}) ≈ 7.211Similarly, x and z will be positive as long as T is positive, which it is since x, y, z are positive.Okay, now, since I have expressions for x, y, z in terms of T, maybe I can plug these back into one of the original equations to solve for T.Let me choose Equation (1): (x^2 + xy + y^2 = 27)Express x and y in terms of T:x = (T^2 + 29)/(3T)y = (T^2 - 52)/(3T)So, compute x^2 + xy + y^2:First, x^2:([(T^2 + 29)/(3T)]^2 = (T^4 + 58T^2 + 841)/(9T^2))Similarly, y^2:([(T^2 - 52)/(3T)]^2 = (T^4 - 104T^2 + 2704)/(9T^2))Now, xy:[(T^2 + 29)/(3T)] * [(T^2 - 52)/(3T)] = (T^4 - 52T^2 + 29T^2 - 1508)/(9T^2) = (T^4 - 23T^2 - 1508)/(9T^2)So, x^2 + xy + y^2:= [ (T^4 + 58T^2 + 841) + (T^4 - 23T^2 - 1508) + (T^4 - 104T^2 + 2704) ] / (9T^2)Simplify numerator:T^4 + 58T^2 + 841 + T^4 - 23T^2 - 1508 + T^4 - 104T^2 + 2704Combine like terms:3T^4 + (58T^2 - 23T^2 - 104T^2) + (841 - 1508 + 2704)Calculate each:3T^4 + (-69T^2) + (2037)So, numerator is 3T^4 - 69T^2 + 2037Thus, x^2 + xy + y^2 = (3T^4 - 69T^2 + 2037)/(9T^2) = 27So, set equal to 27:(3T^4 - 69T^2 + 2037)/(9T^2) = 27Multiply both sides by 9T^2:3T^4 - 69T^2 + 2037 = 243T^2Bring all terms to left:3T^4 - 69T^2 + 2037 - 243T^2 = 0Combine like terms:3T^4 - (69 + 243)T^2 + 2037 = 0Which is:3T^4 - 312T^2 + 2037 = 0Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:T^4 - 104T^2 + 679 = 0Let me denote u = T^2, so equation becomes:u^2 - 104u + 679 = 0Solve for u using quadratic formula:u = [104 ± sqrt(104^2 - 4*1*679)] / 2Compute discriminant:104^2 = 108164*1*679 = 2716So, sqrt(10816 - 2716) = sqrt(8100) = 90Thus, u = [104 ± 90] / 2So, two solutions:u = (104 + 90)/2 = 194/2 = 97u = (104 - 90)/2 = 14/2 = 7So, u = 97 or u = 7But u = T^2, and earlier we had T > sqrt(52) ≈ 7.211, so T^2 > 52.Thus, u = 97 is acceptable, since 97 > 52, but u = 7 is less than 52, which would make T < sqrt(52), which contradicts our earlier conclusion.Thus, u = 97, so T^2 = 97 => T = sqrt(97)Since T is positive.So, T = sqrt(97)Now, with T known, we can find x, y, z.From earlier expressions:x = (T^2 + 29)/(3T) = (97 + 29)/(3*sqrt(97)) = 126/(3*sqrt(97)) = 42/sqrt(97)Similarly, y = (T^2 - 52)/(3T) = (97 - 52)/(3*sqrt(97)) = 45/(3*sqrt(97)) = 15/sqrt(97)z = (T^2 + 23)/(3T) = (97 + 23)/(3*sqrt(97)) = 120/(3*sqrt(97)) = 40/sqrt(97)So, x = 42/sqrt(97), y = 15/sqrt(97), z = 40/sqrt(97)Now, let's compute S = xy + yz + zxCompute each term:xy = (42/sqrt(97))*(15/sqrt(97)) = (42*15)/(97) = 630/97yz = (15/sqrt(97))*(40/sqrt(97)) = (15*40)/97 = 600/97zx = (40/sqrt(97))*(42/sqrt(97)) = (40*42)/97 = 1680/97So, S = 630/97 + 600/97 + 1680/97 = (630 + 600 + 1680)/97 = (2910)/97Compute 2910 ÷ 97:97*30 = 2910So, S = 30Thus, the value of (xy + yz + zx) is 30.**Final Answer**The value of (xy + yz + zx) is boxed{30}."},{"question":"Group A and Group B together consist of 200 people.

The proportion of Group B in the sample is ( frac{24}{40} ), and the proportion in the entire population is ( frac{B}{200} ).Setting these proportions equal gives:[frac{24}{40} = frac{B}{200}]Solving for ( B ), I find that there are 120 people in Group B."},{"question":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is a geometric sequence, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 4, calculate the sum of the first five terms, S_5.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of the first five terms of a geometric sequence. The sequence is given as {a_n}, and they told me that a₂ = 2 and a₃ = 4. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a common ratio, which is usually denoted as 'r'. So, the general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a_n = a₁ * r^(n-1). That makes sense because each term is just the first term multiplied by r raised to the power of one less than the term number.Given that, I know that a₂ = 2 and a₃ = 4. Let me write down what these terms are in terms of a₁ and r.For a₂, which is the second term, the formula would be a₂ = a₁ * r^(2-1) = a₁ * r. And they told me that's equal to 2. So, equation one is:a₁ * r = 2.Similarly, for a₃, which is the third term, the formula is a₃ = a₁ * r^(3-1) = a₁ * r². They said that's equal to 4. So, equation two is:a₁ * r² = 4.Now, I have two equations:1. a₁ * r = 22. a₁ * r² = 4I need to find a₁ and r. Maybe I can divide the second equation by the first to eliminate a₁. Let me try that.Dividing equation two by equation one:(a₁ * r²) / (a₁ * r) = 4 / 2Simplify the left side: a₁ cancels out, and r² / r is r. So, we have:r = 2.Okay, so the common ratio r is 2. Now, I can plug this back into equation one to find a₁.From equation one: a₁ * r = 2We know r is 2, so:a₁ * 2 = 2Divide both sides by 2:a₁ = 1.Great, so the first term is 1 and the common ratio is 2. Now, I need to find the sum of the first five terms, S₅.I remember the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is S_n = a₁ * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), provided that r ≠ 1. Since r is 2 here, which is not 1, this formula should work.So, plugging in the values:S₅ = 1 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)Let me compute 2^5 first. 2^5 is 32.So, substituting back:S₅ = (1 - 32) / (1 - 2)Compute numerator: 1 - 32 = -31Denominator: 1 - 2 = -1So, S₅ = (-31) / (-1) = 31.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, a₁ is 1, r is 2. So, the first five terms are:a₁ = 1a₂ = 1 * 2 = 2a₃ = 2 * 2 = 4a₄ = 4 * 2 = 8a₅ = 8 * 2 = 16So, the terms are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.Adding them up: 1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 4 = 7, 7 + 8 = 15, 15 + 16 = 31.Yes, that adds up to 31. So, the sum of the first five terms is indeed 31.Alternatively, using the formula: S₅ = (1 - 2^5)/(1 - 2) = (1 - 32)/(-1) = (-31)/(-1) = 31. Same result.I think that's correct. So, the sum S₅ is 31.**Final Answer**The sum of the first five terms is boxed{31}."},{"question":"What is the greater of the solutions to the equation x^2 + 15x -54=0?","answer":"To solve the quadratic equation ( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 ), I can use the quadratic formula.First, I identify the coefficients: ( a = 1 ), ( b = 15 ), and ( c = -54 ).Next, I calculate the discriminant using the formula ( D = b^2 - 4ac ). Plugging in the values, ( D = 15^2 - 4(1)(-54) = 225 + 216 = 441 ).Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions.

Let me think about this step by step.First, I remember that in geometry, a plane is defined by three non-collinear points or by a line and a point not on that line. Wait, so if I have a line and a point not on that line, that should determine a unique plane, right? Because if you have a line, it already lies on infinitely many planes, but adding a point not on that line should fix the plane. Let me visualize this. Imagine line l is on the floor, and point P is somewhere above the floor, not touching the line. If I try to draw a plane that contains both the line and the point, how many such planes can I have? Well, I think only one. Because if I have the line and the point, the plane is uniquely determined. It can't be any other plane because the point is fixed in space relative to the line.Wait, but hold on. Is it possible to have more than one plane containing both the line and the point? Let me think. If I have a line and a point not on the line, can I rotate the plane around the line and still have the point on the plane? Hmm, no, because the point is fixed. If I rotate the plane, the point would move away from its original position. So, the plane has to pass through both the line and the specific point, which can only happen in one way.Let me recall the postulate. I think it's called the \\"Plane Determination Postulate.\\" It states that through a line and a point not on the line, there is exactly one plane. So, that confirms it. There's only one plane that can be determined by point P and line l when P is not on l.But just to make sure I'm not missing something, let me consider another perspective. Suppose I have two different planes that both contain line l and point P. If such planes exist, they must intersect along line l. But since point P is not on line l, it can't lie on both planes unless the planes are the same. Therefore, there can't be two different planes containing both l and P. So, that means only one plane exists.Another way to think about it is using vectors. If I have a line l, I can represent it parametrically as l = a + tb, where a is a point on the line, b is the direction vector, and t is a scalar. Point P is not on l, so it can't be expressed in that form. The plane determined by l and P can be represented by the equation (r - a) · (b × (P - a)) = 0. Since this equation defines a unique plane, there's only one such plane.Wait, maybe I should think about this in terms of degrees of freedom. A line in space has four degrees of freedom (two points, each with three coordinates, but constrained by the line's direction). A point not on the line adds three more coordinates, but since we're determining a plane, which has three degrees of freedom (a point and a normal vector), it should fix the plane uniquely. Hmm, that might be a bit abstract, but it seems to support the idea that only one plane is determined.I also remember that two intersecting lines determine a plane, but in this case, we have a line and a point not on the line. Since the point isn't on the line, it's like having two skew lines? Wait, no, because a point isn't a line. Maybe I'm mixing concepts here. Let me clarify: a line and a point not on the line can be thought of as two skew lines if we consider the point as a line, but actually, the point is just a single point, so it's different.Alternatively, if I consider the point P and two points on line l, say A and B, then the three points A, B, and P are non-collinear because P is not on line l. Therefore, these three points determine a unique plane. Since A and B are on line l, the entire line l lies on this plane. So, that's another way to see that only one plane is determined.Wait, is there a possibility of another plane containing both l and P? Suppose I take another point C on line l, different from A and B. Then, points A, C, and P should also determine a plane. But since A, B, and P already determine a plane, and A, C, and P are on the same line l and point P, wouldn't that plane be the same? Yes, because all points on line l are colinear, so any three points including P and two from l will lie on the same plane.Therefore, regardless of which two points on l I choose, the plane determined by those two points and P will always be the same. Hence, only one plane exists that contains both line l and point P.I think I've considered multiple angles here: the postulate, the vector equation, the degrees of freedom, and the non-collinear points approach. All of them lead me to the conclusion that there is exactly one plane determined by point P and line l when P is not on l.Just to recap:1. By the Plane Determination Postulate, a line and a point not on the line determine exactly one plane.2. Using vectors, the plane equation is uniquely defined.3. Considering degrees of freedom, the plane is fixed once the line and point are given.4. Using non-collinear points, three points (two from the line and the external point) determine a unique plane.All these methods confirm that only one plane is possible. So, I feel confident that the answer is one.**Final Answer**The number of planes determined by point P and line l is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Jitka worked a job with a fixed daily wage.

Let ( x ) be the fixed daily wage Jitka earns, and let ( y ) be the cost of one board game.From the first scenario, Jitka worked for three days and earned enough to buy one board game with 490 Kč remaining. This gives the equation:[ 3x = y + 490 ]In the second scenario, she worked for five days and earned enough to buy two board games with 540 Kč remaining.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that consecutive positive integers can be represented in a sequence. Let me denote the first term of such a sequence as 'a' and the number of terms as 'n'. So, the sequence would be a, a+1, a+2, ..., a+(n-1). The sum of these terms should be 100.I remember that the sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: S = n/2 * (2a + (n - 1)). In this case, S is 100, so plugging that in, I get:100 = n/2 * (2a + (n - 1))Let me simplify this equation. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:200 = n * (2a + n - 1)So, 200 = n*(2a + n - 1). Hmm, this equation relates 'n' and 'a'. Since both 'n' and 'a' are positive integers, I can try to find all pairs (n, a) that satisfy this equation.Let me rearrange the equation to solve for 'a' in terms of 'n':2a + n - 1 = 200/nSo,2a = (200/n) - n + 1Therefore,a = [(200/n) - n + 1]/2Since 'a' must be a positive integer, the right-hand side of this equation must also be an integer. That means (200/n - n + 1) must be even because it's divided by 2.So, first, I need to find all positive integers 'n' such that 200 is divisible by 'n', because 200/n must be an integer. So, 'n' must be a divisor of 200.Let me list all the positive divisors of 200. The prime factorization of 200 is 2^3 * 5^2, so the number of divisors is (3+1)*(2+1) = 12. So, the divisors are:1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200.But wait, the problem states that the set must contain at least two elements, so 'n' must be at least 2. So, we can exclude 1 from the list. So, the possible values of 'n' are:2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200.Now, for each of these 'n's, I need to check if 'a' is a positive integer.Let me go through each 'n' one by one.1. n = 2:   a = [(200/2) - 2 + 1]/2 = (100 - 2 + 1)/2 = (99)/2 = 49.5   Hmm, that's not an integer. So, n=2 doesn't work.2. n = 4:   a = [(200/4) - 4 + 1]/2 = (50 - 4 + 1)/2 = (47)/2 = 23.5   Again, not an integer. So, n=4 doesn't work.3. n = 5:   a = [(200/5) - 5 + 1]/2 = (40 - 5 + 1)/2 = (36)/2 = 18   Okay, that's an integer. So, n=5 works. The sequence starts at 18 and has 5 terms: 18,19,20,21,22. Let me check the sum: 18+19+20+21+22 = 100. Yep, that's correct.4. n = 8:   a = [(200/8) - 8 + 1]/2 = (25 - 8 + 1)/2 = (18)/2 = 9   That's an integer. So, n=8 works. The sequence is 9 to 16. Let me add them up: 9+10+11+12+13+14+15+16. Let me compute that: 9+16=25, 10+15=25, 11+14=25, 12+13=25. So, 4*25=100. Perfect.5. n = 10:   a = [(200/10) - 10 + 1]/2 = (20 - 10 + 1)/2 = (11)/2 = 5.5   Not an integer. So, n=10 doesn't work.6. n = 20:   a = [(200/20) - 20 + 1]/2 = (10 - 20 + 1)/2 = (-9)/2 = -4.5   Negative number, and we need positive integers. So, n=20 doesn't work.7. n = 25:   a = [(200/25) - 25 + 1]/2 = (8 - 25 + 1)/2 = (-16)/2 = -8   Negative again. So, n=25 doesn't work.8. n = 40:   a = [(200/40) - 40 + 1]/2 = (5 - 40 + 1)/2 = (-34)/2 = -17   Negative. Doesn't work.9. n = 50:   a = [(200/50) - 50 + 1]/2 = (4 - 50 + 1)/2 = (-45)/2 = -22.5   Not an integer and negative. Doesn't work.10. n = 100:    a = [(200/100) - 100 + 1]/2 = (2 - 100 + 1)/2 = (-97)/2 = -48.5    Negative and not integer. Doesn't work.11. n = 200:    a = [(200/200) - 200 + 1]/2 = (1 - 200 + 1)/2 = (-198)/2 = -99    Negative. Doesn't work.So, from all the divisors, only n=5 and n=8 give positive integer values for 'a'. So, that would suggest there are two such sets.Wait, but hold on. Maybe I missed something. Because sometimes, even if 'n' isn't a divisor of 200, maybe the equation still holds? Let me think.Wait, in the equation 200 = n*(2a + n - 1), 'n' must divide 200 because 2a + n -1 is an integer. So, n must be a divisor of 200. So, I think I didn't miss any 'n's because I considered all the divisors.But let me verify. Maybe I can approach this problem differently. Instead of considering only the divisors of 200, perhaps I can think about the equation 200 = n*(2a + n -1) and see for which 'n's, 2a + n -1 is an integer, which it is because 'a' is integer.But since 200 must be divisible by 'n', I think my initial approach is correct.Wait, but another thought: maybe 'n' doesn't have to be a divisor of 200, but rather, 200/n must be an integer because 2a + n -1 is an integer. So, 200/n must be integer, which implies 'n' divides 200. So, yeah, I think I covered all possible 'n's.So, only n=5 and n=8 work, which gives two sets.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I can have sequences that are longer but start with a negative number? But the problem specifies positive integers, so 'a' must be positive. So, negative starting points are invalid.Is there another way to get more sequences? Maybe if I consider that the number of terms can be even or odd, but I think I considered all possible 'n's.Wait, let me check n=16, just to see. Wait, 16 isn't a divisor of 200, so 200/16 is 12.5, which isn't integer. So, a would be (12.5 -16 +1)/2 = (-2.5)/2 = -1.25, which is negative and not integer. So, n=16 doesn't work.Similarly, n=3: 200/3 is approximately 66.666, which isn't integer. So, a would be (66.666 -3 +1)/2 = (64.666)/2 ≈32.333, which isn't integer.Wait, but n=3 is not a divisor of 200, so 200/n isn't integer, so a isn't integer either. So, n=3 doesn't work.So, yeah, seems like only n=5 and n=8 work.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I can express 100 as the sum of consecutive numbers in another way. For example, sometimes, even if n isn't a divisor, you can have multiple sequences.Wait, another approach: the number of ways to express a number as the sum of consecutive positive integers is equal to the number of odd divisors of that number greater than 1. Is that a thing? Wait, I think I remember something like that.Wait, let me recall. There's a theorem that says that the number of ways to express a number as the sum of consecutive positive integers is equal to the number of odd factors of that number excluding 1. Hmm, let me check.Wait, 100 has prime factors 2^2 * 5^2. So, the number of odd factors is (2+1) = 3, which are 1, 5, 25. Excluding 1, we have 5 and 25. So, that would suggest two ways, which matches my earlier result.So, that seems consistent. So, that would mean there are two such sets.But wait, hold on. Let me see if that theorem is correct. Because sometimes, depending on the number, you can have more representations.Wait, let me test it with a smaller number, say 9.The number of ways to express 9 as sum of consecutive positive integers:1. 92. 4 + 53. 2 + 3 + 4So, that's three ways. The number of odd factors of 9 is 3 (1, 3, 9). Excluding 1, we have 3 and 9, which would suggest two ways, but actually, there are three. Hmm, so maybe the theorem isn't exactly as I remembered.Wait, maybe it's the number of odd factors including 1? For 9, including 1, it's three, which matches the three ways. So, perhaps the number of ways is equal to the number of odd factors, including 1.But in our problem, the sets must contain at least two elements, so we have to exclude the single-element set. So, in the case of 9, the number of ways with at least two elements would be two, which would correspond to the number of odd factors greater than 1, which is two (3 and 9). But in reality, there are three ways, including the single-element set. So, maybe the theorem is that the number of ways is equal to the number of odd factors, including 1, but if we require at least two elements, we subtract 1.So, for 100, the number of odd factors is 3 (1,5,25). So, the number of ways with at least two elements would be 3 -1 = 2. Which matches our earlier result.So, that seems to confirm that the answer is two.But let me just make sure I didn't miss any other sequences.Wait, another approach: Let's consider that the sum of k consecutive integers starting from m is equal to 100.So, the sum is S = k*m + k*(k-1)/2 = 100.So, k*m + k*(k-1)/2 = 100.Multiply both sides by 2:2*k*m + k*(k -1) = 200So,k*(2m + k -1) = 200Which is the same equation as before. So, same reasoning applies.So, k must be a divisor of 200, and (2m + k -1) must be equal to 200/k.So, m = (200/k - k +1)/2Which must be a positive integer.So, same as before.So, for each divisor k of 200, compute m, check if it's positive integer.As before, only k=5 and k=8 give positive integer m.So, that's two sequences.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I can have another sequence where the number of terms is even, but the average is a half-integer. Wait, but in that case, the starting number would be a half-integer, which isn't allowed because we need positive integers.Wait, for example, if I have an even number of terms, the average would be a half-integer, so the starting number would have to be a half-integer, which isn't allowed because we need integers. So, that would mean that only sequences with an odd number of terms can have integer averages, hence starting numbers.Wait, but in our earlier case, n=8 is even, but we still got an integer starting number. How is that possible?Wait, let me see. For n=8, a=9. So, the average is (9 + 16)/2 = 12.5, which is a half-integer. But the sum is 8*12.5=100.But the starting number is still an integer. So, even though the average is a half-integer, the starting number is an integer.So, that seems to contradict my earlier thought.Wait, so maybe both even and odd number of terms can give integer starting numbers, as long as the equation allows it.So, perhaps the theorem about the number of odd factors is not directly applicable here, or maybe it's a different approach.Wait, but in any case, through both methods, I only found two valid sequences: one with 5 terms starting at 18, and another with 8 terms starting at 9.So, maybe the answer is two.But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other sequences.Wait, let's try n=16. Wait, 16 isn't a divisor of 200, so 200/16=12.5, which is not integer. So, a=(12.5 -16 +1)/2=( -2.5)/2=-1.25, which is negative and not integer.n=7: 200/7≈28.571, which is not integer. So, a=(28.571 -7 +1)/2≈(22.571)/2≈11.285, which is not integer.n=6: 200/6≈33.333, not integer. a=(33.333 -6 +1)/2≈28.333/2≈14.166, not integer.n=9: 200/9≈22.222, not integer. a=(22.222 -9 +1)/2≈14.222/2≈7.111, not integer.n=12: 200/12≈16.666, not integer. a=(16.666 -12 +1)/2≈5.666/2≈2.833, not integer.n=15: 200/15≈13.333, not integer. a=(13.333 -15 +1)/2≈(-0.666)/2≈-0.333, negative and not integer.n=14: 200/14≈14.285, not integer. a=(14.285 -14 +1)/2≈1.285/2≈0.642, which is less than 1, so not positive integer.n=11: 200/11≈18.181, not integer. a=(18.181 -11 +1)/2≈8.181/2≈4.090, not integer.n=13: 200/13≈15.384, not integer. a=(15.384 -13 +1)/2≈3.384/2≈1.692, not integer.n=17: 200/17≈11.764, not integer. a=(11.764 -17 +1)/2≈(-4.236)/2≈-2.118, negative.n=18: 200/18≈11.111, not integer. a=(11.111 -18 +1)/2≈(-5.889)/2≈-2.944, negative.n=19: 200/19≈10.526, not integer. a=(10.526 -19 +1)/2≈(-7.474)/2≈-3.737, negative.n=21: 200/21≈9.523, not integer. a=(9.523 -21 +1)/2≈(-10.477)/2≈-5.238, negative.n=22: 200/22≈9.090, not integer. a=(9.090 -22 +1)/2≈(-11.910)/2≈-5.955, negative.n=23: 200/23≈8.695, not integer. a=(8.695 -23 +1)/2≈(-13.305)/2≈-6.652, negative.n=24: 200/24≈8.333, not integer. a=(8.333 -24 +1)/2≈(-14.667)/2≈-7.333, negative.n=26: 200/26≈7.692, not integer. a=(7.692 -26 +1)/2≈(-17.308)/2≈-8.654, negative.n=27: 200/27≈7.407, not integer. a=(7.407 -27 +1)/2≈(-18.593)/2≈-9.296, negative.n=28: 200/28≈7.142, not integer. a=(7.142 -28 +1)/2≈(-19.858)/2≈-9.929, negative.n=29: 200/29≈6.896, not integer. a=(6.896 -29 +1)/2≈(-21.104)/2≈-10.552, negative.n=30: 200/30≈6.666, not integer. a=(6.666 -30 +1)/2≈(-22.334)/2≈-11.167, negative.And as n increases beyond that, a becomes more negative, so no point checking further.So, yeah, seems like only n=5 and n=8 give positive integer starting points. So, two sets.Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using the formula for the number of ways to express a number as sum of consecutive integers.I think the formula is that the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to factor the number into two integers of opposite parity, where the smaller factor is the number of terms.Wait, let me see. So, for 100, we can factor it as:1*100 (both same parity)2*50 (both even)4*25 (even and odd)5*20 (odd and even)8*12.5 (not integer)10*10 (same parity)20*5 (same as 5*20)25*4 (same as 4*25)50*2 (same as 2*50)100*1 (same as 1*100)Wait, so the pairs where one is even and the other is odd are (4,25) and (5,20). So, that's two pairs, which would correspond to two ways. So, that also gives us two sets.So, that's consistent with my previous results.Therefore, I think the answer is two.**Final Answer**The number of such sets is boxed{2}."},{"question":"If f(x)=(2x+a)^{2}, and f′(2)=20, then a= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If ( f(x) = (2x + a)^2 ), and ( f'(2) = 20 ), then I need to find the value of ( a ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that to find the derivative of a function, I can use the chain rule. The chain rule is useful when dealing with composite functions, which is exactly what we have here because ( f(x) ) is a square of another function ( 2x + a ). So, let me write that down.The function is ( f(x) = (2x + a)^2 ). To find the derivative ( f'(x) ), I'll apply the chain rule. The chain rule states that if you have a function ( h(x) = g(j(x)) ), then the derivative ( h'(x) = g'(j(x)) cdot j'(x) ).In this case, ( g(u) = u^2 ) where ( u = 2x + a ). So, the derivative of ( g(u) ) with respect to ( u ) is ( 2u ). Then, the derivative of the inside function ( j(x) = 2x + a ) with respect to ( x ) is 2. Putting it all together, the derivative ( f'(x) ) should be ( 2u cdot 2 ), which is ( 2(2x + a) cdot 2 ). Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, ( g'(u) = 2u ) and ( j'(x) = 2 ), so multiplying them gives ( 2u cdot 2 = 4u ). Substituting back ( u = 2x + a ), we get ( f'(x) = 4(2x + a) ). Let me double-check that. If I expand ( f(x) ) first, maybe that will help. So, ( f(x) = (2x + a)^2 = 4x^2 + 4ax + a^2 ). Then, taking the derivative term by term: the derivative of ( 4x^2 ) is ( 8x ), the derivative of ( 4ax ) is ( 4a ), and the derivative of ( a^2 ) is 0. So, putting it together, ( f'(x) = 8x + 4a ). Wait, hold on, that's different from what I got earlier. Earlier, using the chain rule, I got ( f'(x) = 4(2x + a) ), which simplifies to ( 8x + 4a ). So, actually, both methods give the same result. Good, so that checks out. So, ( f'(x) = 8x + 4a ). Now, the problem states that ( f'(2) = 20 ). That means when ( x = 2 ), the derivative is 20. Let me plug in ( x = 2 ) into the derivative.So, ( f'(2) = 8(2) + 4a = 16 + 4a ). According to the problem, this equals 20. So, I can set up the equation:( 16 + 4a = 20 )Now, I need to solve for ( a ). Let's subtract 16 from both sides:( 4a = 20 - 16 )( 4a = 4 )Then, divide both sides by 4:( a = 1 )Wait, so ( a ) is 1? Let me verify that. If ( a = 1 ), then the original function is ( f(x) = (2x + 1)^2 ). Let's compute the derivative again:( f'(x) = 2(2x + 1) cdot 2 = 4(2x + 1) = 8x + 4 ). Then, ( f'(2) = 8(2) + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20 ). Yep, that's correct. So, ( a = 1 ) is indeed the right answer.Alternatively, if I use the expanded form, ( f'(x) = 8x + 4a ). Plugging in ( x = 2 ), we get ( 16 + 4a = 20 ), so ( 4a = 4 ), ( a = 1 ). Same result.Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me go through the steps again.1. Start with ( f(x) = (2x + a)^2 ).2. Find ( f'(x) ) using the chain rule: ( f'(x) = 2(2x + a) cdot 2 = 4(2x + a) = 8x + 4a ).3. Plug in ( x = 2 ): ( f'(2) = 8(2) + 4a = 16 + 4a ).4. Set equal to 20: ( 16 + 4a = 20 ).5. Subtract 16: ( 4a = 4 ).6. Divide by 4: ( a = 1 ).Everything seems to check out. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, I'm confident that ( a = 1 ) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Bag A contains 2 ten-yuan bills and 3 one-yuan bills, and bag B contains 4 five-yuan bills and 3 one-yuan bills. If two bills are randomly drawn from each bag, what is the probability that the sum of the denominations of the remaining bills in bag A is greater than the sum of the denominations of the remaining bills in bag B?","answer":"Okay, so I have this probability problem about two bags, A and B, each containing different denominations of bills. I need to find the probability that the sum of the remaining bills in bag A is greater than the sum in bag B after drawing two bills from each. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand the composition of each bag.Bag A has 2 ten-yuan bills and 3 one-yuan bills. So, in total, that's 2 + 3 = 5 bills. Bag B has 4 five-yuan bills and 3 one-yuan bills, so that's 4 + 3 = 7 bills. The problem says that two bills are drawn randomly from each bag. After this drawing, we need to compare the sum of the remaining bills in A and B. Specifically, we want the probability that the sum in A is greater than the sum in B.Alright, so maybe I should approach this by considering all possible outcomes of drawing two bills from each bag, calculate the remaining sums for each case, and then determine in how many of those cases the sum of A is greater than that of B. Then, the probability would be the number of favorable cases divided by the total number of possible cases.Let me structure this:1. For bag A, figure out all possible ways to draw two bills, compute the remaining sum for each case.2. For bag B, do the same: all possible ways to draw two bills, compute the remaining sum.3. Compare each possible remaining sum of A with each possible remaining sum of B, count how many times A's sum is greater than B's sum.4. The probability is then the number of such favorable cases divided by the total number of possible cases.Wait, but since the draws from A and B are independent, the total number of cases would be the product of the number of possible draws from A and the number of possible draws from B. So, I need to compute the number of possible draws for each bag first.Starting with bag A:Bag A has 5 bills: 2 tens and 3 ones. The number of ways to draw two bills is C(5,2) = 10.Similarly, for bag B:Bag B has 7 bills: 4 fives and 3 ones. The number of ways to draw two bills is C(7,2) = 21.So, in total, there are 10 * 21 = 210 possible combinations of draws from A and B.But wait, actually, each draw from A and each draw from B are independent, so the total number of possible cases is indeed 10 * 21 = 210.Now, for each possible draw from A, compute the remaining sum, and for each possible draw from B, compute the remaining sum. Then, for each pair of draws (one from A, one from B), check if A's remaining sum > B's remaining sum.Alternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to compute the remaining sums for each possible draw from A and B, then find the probability by counting the number of pairs where A's remaining sum > B's remaining sum.Let me try to compute the possible remaining sums for A and B.Starting with bag A:Original sum of A: 2*10 + 3*1 = 20 + 3 = 23 yuan.When we draw two bills, the remaining sum will be 23 minus the sum of the two drawn bills.So, the remaining sum in A depends on which two bills are drawn.Possible cases for drawing two bills from A:Case 1: Two ten-yuan bills. The number of ways: C(2,2) = 1. The sum drawn: 10 + 10 = 20. Remaining sum: 23 - 20 = 3.Case 2: One ten-yuan and one one-yuan bill. The number of ways: C(2,1)*C(3,1) = 2*3 = 6. The sum drawn: 10 + 1 = 11. Remaining sum: 23 - 11 = 12.Case 3: Two one-yuan bills. The number of ways: C(3,2) = 3. The sum drawn: 1 + 1 = 2. Remaining sum: 23 - 2 = 21.So, for bag A, the possible remaining sums are 3, 12, and 21, with respective counts of 1, 6, and 3.Similarly, for bag B:Original sum of B: 4*5 + 3*1 = 20 + 3 = 23 yuan.When we draw two bills, the remaining sum will be 23 minus the sum of the two drawn bills.Possible cases for drawing two bills from B:Case 1: Two five-yuan bills. The number of ways: C(4,2) = 6. The sum drawn: 5 + 5 = 10. Remaining sum: 23 - 10 = 13.Case 2: One five-yuan and one one-yuan bill. The number of ways: C(4,1)*C(3,1) = 4*3 = 12. The sum drawn: 5 + 1 = 6. Remaining sum: 23 - 6 = 17.Case 3: Two one-yuan bills. The number of ways: C(3,2) = 3. The sum drawn: 1 + 1 = 2. Remaining sum: 23 - 2 = 21.So, for bag B, the possible remaining sums are 13, 17, and 21, with respective counts of 6, 12, and 3.Alright, so now I have for bag A:- Remaining sum: 3, occurs 1 time- Remaining sum: 12, occurs 6 times- Remaining sum: 21, occurs 3 timesAnd for bag B:- Remaining sum: 13, occurs 6 times- Remaining sum: 17, occurs 12 times- Remaining sum: 21, occurs 3 timesNow, I need to compare each possible remaining sum of A with each possible remaining sum of B and count how many times A's sum is greater than B's sum.Since the draws are independent, each outcome from A can pair with each outcome from B. So, the total number of pairs is 10 (from A) * 21 (from B) = 210, as I thought earlier.But since the remaining sums have multiple counts, I can compute the number of favorable cases by considering the counts.So, let me structure this as a table:For each remaining sum in A, and for each remaining sum in B, if A_sum > B_sum, then add the product of their counts to the total favorable cases.Let me list the remaining sums for A and B:A: 3 (1), 12 (6), 21 (3)B: 13 (6), 17 (12), 21 (3)So, let's go through each combination:1. A=3 vs B=13: 3 > 13? No2. A=3 vs B=17: 3 > 17? No3. A=3 vs B=21: 3 > 21? No4. A=12 vs B=13: 12 > 13? No5. A=12 vs B=17: 12 > 17? No6. A=12 vs B=21: 12 > 21? No7. A=21 vs B=13: 21 > 13? Yes8. A=21 vs B=17: 21 > 17? Yes9. A=21 vs B=21: 21 > 21? NoSo, only when A's remaining sum is 21, and B's remaining sum is 13 or 17, do we have A > B. The case when both are 21 is not favorable.Now, let's compute the number of favorable cases.For A=21, which occurs 3 times, and B=13, which occurs 6 times: 3 * 6 = 18 favorable cases.For A=21, and B=17, which occurs 12 times: 3 * 12 = 36 favorable cases.So, total favorable cases: 18 + 36 = 54.Is that correct? Let me double-check.Wait, no. Actually, the counts for A and B are the number of ways each remaining sum can occur. So, for each remaining sum in A, we have a certain number of ways, and for each remaining sum in B, we have a certain number of ways. So, the number of favorable cases is the sum over all A and B where A_sum > B_sum of (count_A * count_B).So, in the above, when A=21 (count=3) and B=13 (count=6), the number of favorable cases is 3*6=18.Similarly, when A=21 (count=3) and B=17 (count=12), it's 3*12=36.So, total favorable cases: 18 + 36 = 54.Total possible cases: 10 (from A) * 21 (from B) = 210.Therefore, the probability is 54 / 210.Simplify this fraction:Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 54 ÷ 6 = 9, 210 ÷ 6 = 35.So, 9/35.Wait, but let me think again: is 54 divided by 210 equal to 9/35? Let me compute 54 ÷ 6 = 9, 210 ÷ 6 = 35. Yes, that's correct.So, the probability is 9/35.But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any cases where A's remaining sum is greater than B's.Looking back at the possible remaining sums:A can have 3, 12, 21.B can have 13, 17, 21.So, when A=3: 3 is less than 13, 17, 21. So no cases.When A=12: 12 is less than 13, 17, 21. So no cases.When A=21: 21 is greater than 13 and 17, but equal to 21. So only two cases: 21 vs 13 and 21 vs 17.So, yes, only those two cases contribute to favorable outcomes.Hence, 54 favorable cases out of 210, which simplifies to 9/35.Therefore, the probability is 9/35.Wait, but let me think again: is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the difference in the remaining sums?Alternatively, since the total sum in both bags is the same: 23 yuan. So, if we denote S_A as the remaining sum in A, and S_B as the remaining sum in B, then S_A = 23 - sum of two drawn from A, and S_B = 23 - sum of two drawn from B.We want S_A > S_B, which is equivalent to 23 - sum_A > 23 - sum_B, which simplifies to sum_B > sum_A.So, the condition S_A > S_B is equivalent to sum_B > sum_A.Therefore, the probability that S_A > S_B is equal to the probability that sum_B > sum_A.But since the draws from A and B are independent, the probability that sum_B > sum_A is equal to the probability that sum_A > sum_B, right? Because for every pair where sum_A > sum_B, there's a corresponding pair where sum_B > sum_A, except when sum_A = sum_B.Wait, but is that necessarily the case? Because the distributions of sum_A and sum_B might not be symmetric. So, maybe the probability that sum_B > sum_A is not equal to the probability that sum_A > sum_B.Wait, let me think. If the two random variables are independent and identically distributed, then yes, the probabilities would be equal. But in this case, the distributions are different because the composition of the bags is different.So, in this case, the distributions of sum_A and sum_B are different, so the probability that sum_B > sum_A is not necessarily equal to the probability that sum_A > sum_B.Therefore, my initial approach was correct: compute the number of cases where S_A > S_B, which is equivalent to sum_B > sum_A.But in my earlier calculation, I found that the number of favorable cases is 54, leading to a probability of 9/35.Wait, but let me think again: is 54 the correct number of favorable cases?Wait, when A's remaining sum is 21, which occurs 3 times, and B's remaining sum is 13, which occurs 6 times, so 3*6=18.Similarly, when A's remaining sum is 21, and B's remaining sum is 17, which occurs 12 times, so 3*12=36.So, 18 + 36 = 54.Total cases: 10*21=210.So, 54/210=9/35.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the probability by considering the difference in the sums.But perhaps that's more complicated.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the probability that sum_B > sum_A, which is the same as S_A > S_B.Wait, but in my initial approach, I considered S_A > S_B as equivalent to sum_B > sum_A, which is correct because S_A = 23 - sum_A, S_B = 23 - sum_B.So, S_A > S_B => 23 - sum_A > 23 - sum_B => -sum_A > -sum_B => sum_B > sum_A.So, yes, the two events are equivalent.Therefore, the probability that S_A > S_B is equal to the probability that sum_B > sum_A.But since the draws are independent, perhaps we can compute this probability by considering the possible sums.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the probability that sum_B > sum_A by considering all possible pairs of sums.But in any case, my initial approach seems correct.Wait, but let me think about the counts again.For bag A:- Drawing two tens: sum drawn=20, remaining sum=3, count=1- Drawing one ten and one one: sum drawn=11, remaining sum=12, count=6- Drawing two ones: sum drawn=2, remaining sum=21, count=3For bag B:- Drawing two fives: sum drawn=10, remaining sum=13, count=6- Drawing one five and one one: sum drawn=6, remaining sum=17, count=12- Drawing two ones: sum drawn=2, remaining sum=21, count=3So, for each possible remaining sum in A and B, we can compute the number of cases where A's remaining sum > B's remaining sum.So, let's list all possible pairs:1. A=3 vs B=13: 3 > 13? No2. A=3 vs B=17: 3 > 17? No3. A=3 vs B=21: 3 > 21? No4. A=12 vs B=13: 12 > 13? No5. A=12 vs B=17: 12 > 17? No6. A=12 vs B=21: 12 > 21? No7. A=21 vs B=13: 21 > 13? Yes8. A=21 vs B=17: 21 > 17? Yes9. A=21 vs B=21: 21 > 21? NoSo, only when A=21 and B=13 or B=17 do we have A > B.Now, the number of such cases is:For A=21 (count=3) and B=13 (count=6): 3*6=18For A=21 (count=3) and B=17 (count=12): 3*12=36Total: 18 + 36 = 54Total possible cases: 10*21=210So, probability is 54/210=9/35.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using probabilities instead of counts.Compute the probability that A's remaining sum is 21, which is 3/10, and then compute the probability that B's remaining sum is less than 21, which is (6+12)/21=18/21=6/7.So, the joint probability is (3/10)*(6/7)=18/70.Similarly, the probability that A's remaining sum is 21 and B's remaining sum is 17: (3/10)*(12/21)= (3/10)*(4/7)=12/70.Wait, but actually, when A's remaining sum is 21, B's remaining sum can be 13, 17, or 21. So, the probability that B's remaining sum is less than 21 is 18/21, as above.But actually, when A's remaining sum is 21, the probability that B's remaining sum is less than 21 is (6+12)/21=18/21=6/7.Therefore, the probability that A's remaining sum is 21 and B's remaining sum is less than 21 is (3/10)*(6/7)=18/70.Similarly, when A's remaining sum is 12, which is 6/10, the probability that B's remaining sum is less than 12. But B's remaining sums are 13,17,21, all of which are greater than 12. So, no contribution here.When A's remaining sum is 3, which is 1/10, the probability that B's remaining sum is less than 3. But B's remaining sums are 13,17,21, all greater than 3. So, no contribution.Therefore, the total probability is 18/70.Wait, but earlier I had 54/210=9/35=18/70. Yes, same result.So, 18/70 simplifies to 9/35.Therefore, the probability is 9/35.Wait, but let me think again: when I computed the counts, I had 54 favorable cases out of 210, which is 54/210=9/35.When I computed the probabilities, I had (3/10)*(6/7)=18/70=9/35.So, both methods give the same result.Therefore, I think 9/35 is the correct probability.But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expected value of the remaining sums, but that might not directly help because we need the probability, not the expectation.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the probability by considering the possible sums drawn from each bag.Wait, but I think my initial approach is solid.So, to recap:- For bag A, the possible remaining sums are 3, 12, 21, with counts 1, 6, 3.- For bag B, the possible remaining sums are 13, 17, 21, with counts 6, 12, 3.- We need to find the number of pairs where A's remaining sum > B's remaining sum.- Only when A's remaining sum is 21 and B's remaining sum is 13 or 17.- The number of such pairs is 3*6 + 3*12 = 18 + 36 = 54.- Total possible pairs: 10*21=210.- Probability: 54/210=9/35.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the probability is 9/35.**Final Answer**The probability is boxed{dfrac{9}{35}}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=sin x+ sqrt {3}cos x, the maximum value of f(x) is __________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = sin x + sqrt(3) cos x, and I need to find its maximum value. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with functions that are combinations of sine and cosine, there's a way to rewrite them as a single sine or cosine function with a phase shift. Maybe that will help me find the maximum.Let me recall the formula. If I have a function like A sin x + B cos x, it can be rewritten as C sin(x + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The amplitude C is calculated using the formula C = sqrt(A² + B²). So in this case, A is 1 and B is sqrt(3). Let me compute that.C = sqrt(1² + (sqrt(3))²) = sqrt(1 + 3) = sqrt(4) = 2. Okay, so the amplitude is 2. That means the maximum value of the function should be 2, right? Because the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, so when multiplied by 2, it goes between -2 and 2. So the maximum is 2.Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I should actually go through the process of rewriting the function to confirm. So, starting with f(x) = sin x + sqrt(3) cos x.I want to write this as C sin(x + φ). Let me expand that using the sine addition formula: C sin(x + φ) = C sin x cos φ + C cos x sin φ. So, comparing this to f(x) = sin x + sqrt(3) cos x, I can set up the equations:C cos φ = 1 (coefficient of sin x)C sin φ = sqrt(3) (coefficient of cos x)We already found that C = 2, so plugging that in:2 cos φ = 1 => cos φ = 1/22 sin φ = sqrt(3) => sin φ = sqrt(3)/2What angle φ has cosine 1/2 and sine sqrt(3)/2? That's 60 degrees or π/3 radians. So φ = π/3.Therefore, f(x) can be rewritten as 2 sin(x + π/3). So the maximum value of this function is indeed 2, since the sine function has a maximum of 1, and multiplying by 2 gives 2. That makes sense.Alternatively, I could use calculus to find the maximum. Let me try that method too to double-check. If I take the derivative of f(x), set it equal to zero, and solve for x, that should give me the critical points, and then I can determine which one gives the maximum.So f(x) = sin x + sqrt(3) cos xf'(x) = cos x - sqrt(3) sin xSet f'(x) = 0:cos x - sqrt(3) sin x = 0cos x = sqrt(3) sin xDivide both sides by cos x (assuming cos x ≠ 0):1 = sqrt(3) tan xtan x = 1/sqrt(3)So x = π/6 + kπ, where k is any integer.Now, let's plug x = π/6 into f(x) to see the value:f(π/6) = sin(π/6) + sqrt(3) cos(π/6)sin(π/6) = 1/2cos(π/6) = sqrt(3)/2So f(π/6) = 1/2 + sqrt(3)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 1/2 + (3)/2 = 2Similarly, plugging x = π/6 + π = 7π/6:f(7π/6) = sin(7π/6) + sqrt(3) cos(7π/6)sin(7π/6) = -1/2cos(7π/6) = -sqrt(3)/2So f(7π/6) = -1/2 + sqrt(3)*(-sqrt(3)/2) = -1/2 - 3/2 = -2So the maximum value is 2, and the minimum is -2. That confirms what I found earlier with the amplitude method.Wait, just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using vectors or something? I remember that the maximum of A sin x + B cos x can be thought of as the magnitude of the vector (A, B). So in this case, the vector would be (1, sqrt(3)), and its magnitude is sqrt(1 + 3) = 2. So that's another way to see it.Yeah, that all lines up. So regardless of the method I use—rewriting the function, calculus, or vector interpretation—the maximum value is 2. I think that's solid.Just to recap:1. Rewriting f(x) as a single sine function with amplitude 2, so max is 2.2. Calculus: found critical points at π/6 and 7π/6, evaluated f(x) to get 2 and -2.3. Vector approach: magnitude of (1, sqrt(3)) is 2.All methods lead to the same conclusion. So I feel confident that the maximum value is 2.**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( f(x) ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Calculate the value of:cos^2 frac{pi}{17} + cos^2 frac{2pi}{17} + cdots + cos^2 frac{16pi}{17} ","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the value of the sum of cos squared terms from π/17 up to 16π/17. That is,cos^2 frac{pi}{17} + cos^2 frac{2pi}{17} + cdots + cos^2 frac{16pi}{17}Hmm, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that relate sums of cosines or their squares. Maybe I can use one of those identities to simplify this sum. Let me think.First, I recall that the square of cosine can be expressed using the double-angle identity:cos^2 theta = frac{1 + cos 2theta}{2}So, if I apply this identity to each term in the sum, I can rewrite the entire sum as:sum_{k=1}^{16} cos^2 frac{kpi}{17} = sum_{k=1}^{16} frac{1 + cos frac{2kpi}{17}}{2}That simplifies to:frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{16} 1 + frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{16} cos frac{2kpi}{17}Calculating the first sum is straightforward. Since we're adding 1 sixteen times, it's just 16. So,frac{1}{2} times 16 = 8Now, the tricky part is evaluating the second sum:frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{16} cos frac{2kpi}{17}I need to find the sum of cosines where the angles are multiples of 2π/17. I remember that there's a formula for the sum of cosines of an arithmetic sequence. The general formula is:sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + kd) = frac{sinleft(frac{nd}{2}right)}{sinleft(frac{d}{2}right)} cosleft(a + frac{(n-1)d}{2}right)In this case, our angles start at 2π/17 and go up to 32π/17, but since cosine is periodic with period 2π, 32π/17 is equivalent to 32π/17 - 2π = 32π/17 - 34π/17 = -2π/17. But cosine is even, so cos(-2π/17) = cos(2π/17). Wait, but that seems like it might complicate things.Wait, actually, let me think again. The sum is from k=1 to 16 of cos(2kπ/17). So, that's 16 terms. Let me see if I can apply the formula.Let me set a = 2π/17 and d = 2π/17. Then, n = 16. So, plugging into the formula:sum_{k=1}^{16} cosleft(frac{2kpi}{17}right) = sum_{k=1}^{16} cosleft(a + (k-1)dright)Wait, actually, in the formula, the sum starts at k=0, so if I adjust for that, it's:sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + kd) = frac{sinleft(frac{nd}{2}right)}{sinleft(frac{d}{2}right)} cosleft(a + frac{(n-1)d}{2}right)So, in our case, a = 2π/17, d = 2π/17, and n = 16. So, substituting:sum_{k=0}^{15} cosleft(frac{2pi}{17} + frac{2kpi}{17}right) = frac{sinleft(frac{16 times 2pi}{2 times 17}right)}{sinleft(frac{2pi}{2 times 17}right)} cosleft(frac{2pi}{17} + frac{(15) times 2pi}{2 times 17}right)Simplify the arguments:First, the numerator of the sine term:frac{16 times 2pi}{2 times 17} = frac{32pi}{34} = frac{16pi}{17}Denominator:frac{2pi}{2 times 17} = frac{pi}{17}The argument of the cosine term:frac{2pi}{17} + frac{15 times 2pi}{34} = frac{2pi}{17} + frac{30pi}{34} = frac{2pi}{17} + frac{15pi}{17} = frac{17pi}{17} = piSo, putting it all together:sum_{k=0}^{15} cosleft(frac{2pi}{17} + frac{2kpi}{17}right) = frac{sinleft(frac{16pi}{17}right)}{sinleft(frac{pi}{17}right)} cos(pi)But cos(π) is -1, so:frac{sinleft(frac{16pi}{17}right)}{sinleft(frac{pi}{17}right)} times (-1)Now, sin(16π/17) is equal to sin(π - π/17) = sin(π/17). Because sin(π - x) = sin x. So,frac{sinleft(frac{pi}{17}right)}{sinleft(frac{pi}{17}right)} times (-1) = 1 times (-1) = -1Therefore,sum_{k=0}^{15} cosleft(frac{2pi}{17} + frac{2kpi}{17}right) = -1But wait, our original sum was from k=1 to 16, which is the same as from k=0 to 15, just shifted by one index. So, actually, the sum from k=1 to 16 is equal to the sum from k=0 to 15, which is -1. Therefore,sum_{k=1}^{16} cosleft(frac{2kpi}{17}right) = -1Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. If k=0, then the term is cos(2π/17 * 0) = cos(0) = 1. So, the sum from k=0 to 15 is equal to -1, which includes the term when k=0. So, if I subtract that term, which is 1, I get the sum from k=1 to 16:sum_{k=1}^{16} cosleft(frac{2kpi}{17}right) = sum_{k=0}^{15} cosleft(frac{2kpi}{17}right) - cos(0) = (-1) - 1 = -2Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the application of the formula.Wait, let's clarify. The formula gives the sum from k=0 to n-1, which in our case is 16 terms (k=0 to 15). But our original sum is from k=1 to 16, which is also 16 terms. So, actually, if I adjust the formula accordingly, maybe I don't need to subtract anything.Wait, let me re-examine the formula. The formula is:sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + kd) = frac{sinleft(frac{nd}{2}right)}{sinleft(frac{d}{2}right)} cosleft(a + frac{(n-1)d}{2}right)In our case, we have:- a = 2π/17- d = 2π/17- n = 16So, plugging into the formula, we get:sum_{k=0}^{15} cosleft(frac{2pi}{17} + frac{2kpi}{17}right) = frac{sinleft(frac{16 times 2pi}{2 times 17}right)}{sinleft(frac{2pi}{2 times 17}right)} cosleft(frac{2pi}{17} + frac{(15) times 2pi}{2 times 17}right)Simplify:Numerator sine term:frac{16 times 2pi}{2 times 17} = frac{32pi}{34} = frac{16pi}{17}Denominator sine term:frac{2pi}{2 times 17} = frac{pi}{17}Cosine term:frac{2pi}{17} + frac{15 times 2pi}{34} = frac{2pi}{17} + frac{30pi}{34} = frac{2pi}{17} + frac{15pi}{17} = frac{17pi}{17} = piSo, the sum becomes:frac{sinleft(frac{16pi}{17}right)}{sinleft(frac{pi}{17}right)} cos(pi)We know that sin(16π/17) = sin(π - π/17) = sin(π/17), and cos(π) = -1. Therefore:frac{sinleft(frac{pi}{17}right)}{sinleft(frac{pi}{17}right)} times (-1) = 1 times (-1) = -1So, the sum from k=0 to 15 is -1. But our original sum is from k=1 to 16, which is the same as the sum from k=0 to 15, except shifted by one term. Wait, actually, no. Because when k=16, the angle is 32π/17, which is equivalent to 32π/17 - 2π = 32π/17 - 34π/17 = -2π/17, and cos(-2π/17) = cos(2π/17). So, actually, the term at k=16 is the same as the term at k=1. Hmm, that complicates things.Wait, maybe it's better to consider that the sum from k=1 to 16 is equal to the sum from k=1 to 16 of cos(2kπ/17). But since cosine is periodic with period 2π, cos(2kπ/17) for k=1 to 16 is the same as cos(2π/17), cos(4π/17), ..., cos(32π/17). But 32π/17 is equivalent to 32π/17 - 2π = -2π/17, and cos(-2π/17) = cos(2π/17). So, actually, the sum from k=1 to 16 is the same as the sum from k=1 to 16 of cos(2kπ/17), which is equal to the sum from k=1 to 16 of cos(2πk/17). But since cos(2πk/17) for k=1 to 16 is the same as cos(2πk/17) for k=1 to 16, which is the same as the sum from k=1 to 16 of cos(2πk/17). But wait, that's the same as the sum from k=1 to 16 of cos(2πk/17). So, actually, the sum from k=1 to 16 is the same as the sum from k=1 to 16 of cos(2πk/17). But wait, let's think about the roots of unity. The sum of cos(2πk/n) for k=1 to n-1 is equal to -1. Because the sum of all n-th roots of unity is zero, so the sum from k=0 to n-1 is zero, and subtracting 1 (the term at k=0) gives -1. So, in our case, n=17, so the sum from k=1 to 16 of cos(2πk/17) is equal to -1.Wait, that seems conflicting with our earlier result where the sum from k=0 to 15 was -1. But actually, if n=17, the sum from k=1 to 16 of cos(2πk/17) is equal to -1, because the sum from k=0 to 16 is zero (sum of all 17th roots of unity), so subtracting the term at k=0 (which is 1) gives -1.Therefore, the sum from k=1 to 16 of cos(2πk/17) is -1.Wait, so that means in our original problem, the second sum is:frac{1}{2} times (-1) = -frac{1}{2}Therefore, the total sum is:8 + (-frac{1}{2}) = frac{16}{2} - frac{1}{2} = frac{15}{2}Wait, that can't be right because 8 - 1/2 is 7.5, which is 15/2. But let me verify.Wait, hold on. The sum from k=1 to 16 of cos(2πk/17) is indeed -1, as per the roots of unity. So, the second sum is (1/2)*(-1) = -1/2. The first sum was 8. So, 8 - 1/2 = 15/2.But wait, 15/2 is 7.5. Is that the correct answer? Let me think.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the application of the formula. Let me try another approach.I recall that the sum of cos^2(theta) can be related to the sum of cos(2theta). So, using the identity:sum_{k=1}^{n} cos^2 theta_k = frac{n}{2} + frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{n} cos 2theta_kIn our case, n=16, and theta_k = kπ/17. So,sum_{k=1}^{16} cos^2 frac{kpi}{17} = frac{16}{2} + frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{16} cos frac{2kpi}{17} = 8 + frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{16} cos frac{2kpi}{17}As we established earlier, the sum of cos(2kπ/17) from k=1 to 16 is -1. Therefore,8 + frac{1}{2}(-1) = 8 - frac{1}{2} = frac{15}{2}So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the value of the sum is 15/2.But wait, let me think again. Is the sum of cos(2kπ/17) from k=1 to 16 equal to -1? Because the sum of all 17th roots of unity is zero, so sum_{k=0}^{16} e^{i2πk/17} = 0. Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{16} e^{i2πk/17} = -1. Taking the real part, we get sum_{k=1}^{16} cos(2πk/17) = -1. So, yes, that is correct.Therefore, the sum is indeed 15/2.Wait, but let me check with a smaller case to see if this makes sense. Let's say instead of 17, we have n=3. Then, the sum would be cos^2(π/3) + cos^2(2π/3). Let's compute that.cos(π/3) = 1/2, so cos^2(π/3) = 1/4.cos(2π/3) = -1/2, so cos^2(2π/3) = 1/4.Sum is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.Using the formula:sum_{k=1}^{2} cos^2(kπ/3) = 2/2 + (1/2) sum_{k=1}^{2} cos(2kπ/3) = 1 + (1/2)(cos(2π/3) + cos(4π/3)).cos(2π/3) = -1/2, cos(4π/3) = -1/2. So, sum is (-1/2) + (-1/2) = -1. Therefore, 1 + (1/2)(-1) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Which matches.Similarly, for n=5, sum_{k=1}^{4} cos^2(kπ/5). Let's compute it.cos(π/5) ≈ 0.8090, cos^2 ≈ 0.6545cos(2π/5) ≈ 0.3090, cos^2 ≈ 0.0955cos(3π/5) = cos(π - 2π/5) = -cos(2π/5) ≈ -0.3090, cos^2 ≈ 0.0955cos(4π/5) = cos(π - π/5) = -cos(π/5) ≈ -0.8090, cos^2 ≈ 0.6545Sum ≈ 0.6545 + 0.0955 + 0.0955 + 0.6545 ≈ 1.5Using the formula:sum_{k=1}^{4} cos^2(kπ/5) = 4/2 + (1/2) sum_{k=1}^{4} cos(2kπ/5) = 2 + (1/2)(cos(2π/5) + cos(4π/5) + cos(6π/5) + cos(8π/5))But cos(6π/5) = cos(π + π/5) = -cos(π/5) ≈ -0.8090cos(8π/5) = cos(2π - 2π/5) = cos(2π/5) ≈ 0.3090So, sum is cos(2π/5) + cos(4π/5) + cos(6π/5) + cos(8π/5) = cos(2π/5) + (-cos(π/5)) + (-cos(π/5)) + cos(2π/5) = 2cos(2π/5) - 2cos(π/5)But wait, let's compute numerically:cos(2π/5) ≈ 0.3090cos(4π/5) ≈ -0.8090cos(6π/5) ≈ -0.8090cos(8π/5) ≈ 0.3090So, sum ≈ 0.3090 - 0.8090 - 0.8090 + 0.3090 ≈ (0.3090 + 0.3090) + (-0.8090 - 0.8090) ≈ 0.618 - 1.618 ≈ -1Therefore, sum is -1, so (1/2)(-1) = -0.5, so total sum is 2 - 0.5 = 1.5, which matches the direct computation.Therefore, the formula seems to hold for n=3, n=5, so likely holds for n=17 as well.Therefore, the sum is 15/2.But wait, 15/2 is 7.5, which is less than 16*(1/2) = 8, which makes sense because cos^2 terms are less than or equal to 1.Therefore, I think the answer is 15/2.But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this.Another approach could be using the identity for the sum of squares of cosines in an arithmetic progression. I recall that:sum_{k=1}^{n} cos^2 left( theta + frac{kpi}{n} right) = frac{n}{2}But in our case, the angles are kπ/17, so it's not exactly the same. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, I remember that for the sum of cos^2(theta) over equally spaced angles, there's a formula. Specifically, for angles theta, theta + alpha, theta + 2alpha, ..., theta + (n-1)alpha, the sum of cos^2 can be expressed in terms of n and alpha.But in our case, the angles are kπ/17 for k=1 to 16, which are equally spaced with alpha = π/17.Wait, so the sum is:sum_{k=1}^{16} cos^2 left( frac{kpi}{17} right)Which is similar to the sum over k=1 to n-1 of cos^2(kπ/n). So, in our case, n=17.I think there's a general formula for this sum. Let me recall.I found that the sum from k=1 to n-1 of cos^2(kπ/n) is equal to (n-1)/2.Wait, let me test this with n=3: sum is cos^2(π/3) + cos^2(2π/3) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2, which is (3-1)/2 = 1. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, no, (n-1)/2 for n=3 would be 1, but the actual sum is 1/2. So, that can't be.Wait, maybe it's (n)/2 - 1/2.For n=3: 3/2 - 1/2 = 1, but actual sum is 1/2. Hmm, not matching.Wait, perhaps it's (n-1)/2. For n=3, that would be 1, which is not matching. For n=5, the sum was 1.5, which is 3/2, which is (5-1)/2 = 2, which is not matching. Wait, 1.5 is 3/2, which is (5-1)/2 = 2, no, that's not.Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.Wait, in our earlier approach, we used the identity to express cos^2 in terms of cos(2theta), and then used the sum of cosines. That gave us 15/2 for n=17.Alternatively, let me think about the identity:sum_{k=1}^{n-1} cos^2 left( frac{kpi}{n} right) = frac{n-1}{2}Wait, for n=3: sum is 1/2, which is (3-1)/2 = 1. Doesn't match.Wait, perhaps it's (n)/2 - 1/2.For n=3: 3/2 - 1/2 = 1, which is not matching.Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula. Let me look it up in my mind.Wait, another approach: use complex exponentials.Express cos^2(theta) as (1 + cos(2theta))/2, then sum over k=1 to 16.So, sum_{k=1}^{16} cos^2(kπ/17) = 16*(1/2) + (1/2) sum_{k=1}^{16} cos(2kπ/17) = 8 + (1/2)(-1) = 8 - 1/2 = 15/2.Yes, that's consistent.Therefore, the answer is 15/2.But just to make sure, let me think about another way. Maybe using the identity that the sum of cos^2(theta) over theta = kπ/n for k=1 to n-1 is (n-1)/2.Wait, but in our case, n=17, so the sum would be (17-1)/2 = 8. But wait, that contradicts our earlier result of 15/2.Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, actually, the formula might be different.Wait, let me think again. The sum of cos^2(theta) for theta = kπ/n, k=1 to n-1.I think the formula is (n-1)/2.But for n=3: sum is 1/2, which is (3-1)/2 = 1. Wait, that doesn't match.Wait, perhaps the formula is (n-1)/2 when the angles are equally spaced around the unit circle, but in our case, the angles are kπ/17, which are not equally spaced around the full circle, but only half of it.Wait, actually, the angles kπ/17 for k=1 to 16 are equally spaced from π/17 to 16π/17, which is from just above 0 to just below π. So, they are equally spaced in the first half of the unit circle.Therefore, the sum of cos^2(theta) over these angles is different from the sum over a full circle.Wait, but in our earlier approach, using the identity, we found it to be 15/2, which is 7.5.Alternatively, let's think about the identity for the sum of cos^2(theta) over theta = kπ/n for k=1 to n-1.I found a resource that says:sum_{k=1}^{n-1} cos^2 left( frac{kpi}{n} right) = frac{n-1}{2}But in our case, n=17, so sum is (17-1)/2 = 8. But wait, earlier we got 15/2=7.5. So, which one is correct?Wait, let me compute for n=5.For n=5, sum_{k=1}^{4} cos^2(kπ/5) ≈ 1.5, which is 3/2. According to the formula, (5-1)/2=2, which is not matching.Wait, so the formula must be incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for the sum of cos^2(kπ/(2n)) or something else.Wait, maybe I need to derive it.Let me consider the sum S = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} cos^2(kπ/n).Using the identity cos^2(theta) = (1 + cos(2theta))/2, we have:S = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} [1/2 + (1/2)cos(2kπ/n)] = (n-1)/2 + (1/2) sum_{k=1}^{n-1} cos(2kπ/n)Now, the sum sum_{k=1}^{n-1} cos(2kπ/n) is equal to -1, because the sum of all n-th roots of unity is zero, so sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i2πk/n} = 0, so sum_{k=1}^{n-1} e^{i2πk/n} = -1, and taking the real part gives sum_{k=1}^{n-1} cos(2πk/n) = -1.Therefore, S = (n-1)/2 + (1/2)(-1) = (n-1)/2 - 1/2 = (n-2)/2.Wait, for n=5, that would be (5-2)/2=3/2=1.5, which matches our earlier computation.For n=3, (3-2)/2=1/2, which also matches.Therefore, the correct formula is:sum_{k=1}^{n-1} cos^2 left( frac{kpi}{n} right) = frac{n-2}{2}So, in our case, n=17, so the sum is (17-2)/2=15/2=7.5.Therefore, the answer is 15/2.Therefore, the value of the sum is 15/2.**Final Answer**The value of the sum is boxed{dfrac{15}{2}}."},{"question":"Find the least [positive integer](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Positive_integer) n for which frac{n-13}{5n+6} is a non-zero reducible fraction.mathrm{(A) } 45 qquad mathrm{(B)  }68 qquad mathrm{(C)   } 155 qquad mathrm{(D)   } 226 qquad mathrm{(E)   }text84","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the least positive integer ( n ) such that the fraction ( frac{n - 13}{5n + 6} ) is a non-zero reducible fraction. The options given are (A) 45, (B) 68, (C) 155, (D) 226, and (E) 84. Hmm, okay.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A reducible fraction is one where the numerator and the denominator share a common factor greater than 1. So, I need to find the smallest ( n ) such that ( gcd(n - 13, 5n + 6) > 1 ). Also, the fraction should be non-zero, which means ( n - 13 neq 0 ), so ( n neq 13 ). But since all the options are much larger than 13, that's already taken care of.So, my goal is to find the smallest ( n ) among the options where the greatest common divisor (gcd) of ( n - 13 ) and ( 5n + 6 ) is greater than 1.I remember that the Euclidean algorithm is a good way to find the gcd of two numbers. So, maybe I can apply that here. Let me denote ( a = n - 13 ) and ( b = 5n + 6 ). Then, I can express ( b ) in terms of ( a ):( b = 5n + 6 = 5(n - 13) + 5 times 13 + 6 = 5a + 65 + 6 = 5a + 71 ).So, ( b = 5a + 71 ). Now, using the Euclidean algorithm, ( gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, 5a + 71) ). But ( gcd(a, 5a + 71) = gcd(a, 71) ), because ( gcd(a, 5a + 71) = gcd(a, (5a + 71) - 5 times a) = gcd(a, 71) ).So, this simplifies the problem to finding ( gcd(a, 71) ). Since 71 is a prime number, the gcd can only be 1 or 71. Therefore, for ( gcd(n - 13, 5n + 6) ) to be greater than 1, it must be 71. That means ( 71 ) must divide both ( n - 13 ) and ( 5n + 6 ).So, ( 71 ) divides ( n - 13 ), which implies ( n - 13 = 71k ) for some integer ( k ). Therefore, ( n = 71k + 13 ).Similarly, since ( 71 ) divides ( 5n + 6 ), substituting ( n = 71k + 13 ) into this gives:( 5(71k + 13) + 6 = 355k + 65 + 6 = 355k + 71 ).Which is clearly divisible by 71, as ( 355k ) is divisible by 71 (since 355 = 5 × 71) and 71 is obviously divisible by 71. So, that condition is satisfied for any integer ( k ).Therefore, the smallest positive integer ( n ) is when ( k = 1 ), so ( n = 71 times 1 + 13 = 84 ). Wait, but 84 is one of the options, option (E). Hmm, but let me check the options again: (A) 45, (B) 68, (C) 155, (D) 226, (E) 84.So, 84 is an option, but is it the smallest? Let me see. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the gcd can only be 71? Because 71 is prime, so yes, the gcd can only be 1 or 71. So, if the gcd is greater than 1, it must be 71. Therefore, the smallest ( n ) is 84.But wait, let me check with the options given. 84 is an option, but 45, 68, 155, 226 are smaller or larger. Maybe I need to check if any of the smaller options also satisfy the condition.Wait, but according to my reasoning, the smallest ( n ) is 84 because it's the first multiple of 71 plus 13. So, if 84 is the smallest, then why is 84 the last option? Maybe I need to verify.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Euclidean algorithm step. Let me go through that again.We have ( gcd(n - 13, 5n + 6) ). Let me denote ( a = n - 13 ) and ( b = 5n + 6 ). Then, ( gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - 5a) ). Let's compute ( b - 5a ):( b - 5a = (5n + 6) - 5(n - 13) = 5n + 6 - 5n + 65 = 71 ). So, ( gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, 71) ). Since 71 is prime, the gcd is either 1 or 71.Therefore, for the fraction to be reducible, ( gcd(a, 71) = 71 ), which implies that ( 71 ) divides ( a = n - 13 ). Therefore, ( n - 13 ) must be a multiple of 71, so ( n = 71k + 13 ). The smallest positive integer ( n ) is when ( k = 1 ), which gives ( n = 84 ). So, 84 is indeed the smallest such ( n ).But wait, let me check the options again. 84 is an option, but the options also include 45, 68, 155, 226. So, is 84 the correct answer? Or is there a mistake in my reasoning?Wait, perhaps I should check if any of the smaller numbers also satisfy the condition. Maybe 71 isn't the only possible common divisor? Wait, no, because 71 is prime, so the only possible common divisors are 1 and 71. So, if the gcd is greater than 1, it must be 71. Therefore, the smallest ( n ) is 84.But let me test it with ( n = 84 ). Compute ( n - 13 = 84 - 13 = 71 ). Compute ( 5n + 6 = 5*84 + 6 = 420 + 6 = 426 ). Now, ( gcd(71, 426) ). Since 426 divided by 71 is 6, because 71*6=426. So, yes, gcd is 71, which is greater than 1. So, 84 works.But let me check if any of the smaller options also work. Let's take ( n = 45 ). Then, ( n - 13 = 32 ), ( 5n + 6 = 225 + 6 = 231 ). Compute ( gcd(32, 231) ). 32 is 2^5, 231 is 3*7*11. No common factors, so gcd is 1. So, 45 doesn't work.Next, ( n = 68 ). ( n - 13 = 55 ), ( 5n + 6 = 340 + 6 = 346 ). Compute ( gcd(55, 346) ). 55 is 5*11, 346 divided by 2 is 173, which is prime. So, gcd is 1. So, 68 doesn't work.Next, ( n = 155 ). ( n - 13 = 142 ), ( 5n + 6 = 775 + 6 = 781 ). Compute ( gcd(142, 781) ). 142 is 2*71, 781 divided by 11 is 71, because 11*71=781. So, ( gcd(142, 781) = 71 ). So, gcd is 71, which is greater than 1. So, 155 works.But wait, 155 is larger than 84, so 84 is still the smaller one. So, 84 is the answer.Wait, but let me check ( n = 226 ). ( n - 13 = 213 ), ( 5n + 6 = 1130 + 6 = 1136 ). Compute ( gcd(213, 1136) ). 213 is 3*71, 1136 divided by 71 is 16, because 71*16=1136. So, gcd is 71. So, 226 also works.But since 84 is smaller than 155 and 226, and 84 is an option, that should be the answer.Wait, but hold on. The problem is asking for the least positive integer ( n ). So, 84 is the least among the options given, but is there a smaller ( n ) not listed in the options? Wait, the options are (A) 45, (B) 68, (C) 155, (D) 226, (E) 84. So, 84 is the smallest among these, but is 84 indeed the smallest possible? Or is there a smaller ( n ) that isn't listed?Wait, according to my earlier reasoning, the smallest ( n ) is 84 because ( n = 71k + 13 ), and the smallest positive integer is when ( k = 1 ), giving ( n = 84 ). So, 84 is indeed the smallest possible ( n ). Therefore, 84 is the correct answer.But wait, let me just make sure. Let's test ( n = 84 ): numerator is 71, denominator is 426. 71 divides both, so yes, it's reducible. And 71 is prime, so that's the only common factor. So, yes, it works.Therefore, the answer should be 84, which is option (E).Wait, but hold on, the options are listed as (A) 45, (B) 68, (C) 155, (D) 226, (E) 84. So, 84 is option (E). So, that's the answer.But just to make sure, let me check ( n = 84 ) again. ( n - 13 = 71 ), ( 5n + 6 = 426 ). ( gcd(71, 426) = 71 ), so yes, reducible. So, 84 is correct.I think I'm confident now that 84 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"Given that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_n} is S_n, and S_4=24, a_8=17, find S_8.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_n} is S_n. We're given that S_4 = 24 and a_8 = 17, and we need to find S_8.First, let me recall what I know about arithmetic sequences. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, if the first term is a_1 and the common difference is d, then the nth term, a_n, can be written as:a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)dAlso, the sum of the first n terms, S_n, is given by the formula:S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)Alternatively, it can also be written as:S_n = n * (a_1 + a_n)/2Since we have two pieces of information, S_4 and a_8, maybe I can set up two equations and solve for a_1 and d.Let's start with S_4 = 24. Using the sum formula:S_4 = 4/2 * (2a_1 + (4 - 1)d) = 24Simplify that:2 * (2a_1 + 3d) = 24Divide both sides by 2:2a_1 + 3d = 12So that's our first equation: 2a_1 + 3d = 12.Now, the second piece of information is a_8 = 17. Using the nth term formula:a_8 = a_1 + (8 - 1)d = 17Simplify that:a_1 + 7d = 17So that's our second equation: a_1 + 7d = 17.Now, we have a system of two equations:1) 2a_1 + 3d = 122) a_1 + 7d = 17I need to solve for a_1 and d. Let me use the substitution method. From equation 2, I can express a_1 in terms of d:a_1 = 17 - 7dNow, substitute this into equation 1:2*(17 - 7d) + 3d = 12Let me compute that:34 - 14d + 3d = 12Combine like terms:34 - 11d = 12Subtract 34 from both sides:-11d = 12 - 34-11d = -22Divide both sides by -11:d = (-22)/(-11) = 2So, the common difference d is 2.Now, substitute d = 2 back into equation 2 to find a_1:a_1 + 7*2 = 17a_1 + 14 = 17Subtract 14 from both sides:a_1 = 3So, the first term a_1 is 3, and the common difference d is 2.Now, the problem asks for S_8, the sum of the first 8 terms. Let's use the sum formula again:S_8 = 8/2 * (2a_1 + (8 - 1)d)Simplify:4 * (2*3 + 7*2) = 4*(6 + 14) = 4*20 = 80Alternatively, I can compute it using the other sum formula:S_8 = 8*(a_1 + a_8)/2We know a_1 is 3 and a_8 is 17, so:S_8 = 8*(3 + 17)/2 = 8*20/2 = 8*10 = 80Either way, I get S_8 = 80.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, solving for a_1 and d:From S_4 = 24:2a_1 + 3d = 12From a_8 = 17:a_1 + 7d = 17We solved for a_1 = 17 - 7d, substituted into the first equation:2*(17 - 7d) + 3d = 34 - 14d + 3d = 34 - 11d = 12So, 34 - 11d = 12 => -11d = -22 => d = 2. That seems correct.Then, a_1 = 17 - 7*2 = 17 - 14 = 3. Correct.Then, S_8: using the formula, n=8, a_1=3, d=2.Compute 2a_1 + (n -1)d = 6 + 14 = 20. Then, 8/2=4, so 4*20=80. That seems right.Alternatively, computing a_8: a_8 = 3 + 7*2 = 3 + 14 = 17, which matches the given information.So, the calculations seem consistent.Therefore, S_8 is 80.**Final Answer**The sum of the first 8 terms is boxed{80}."},{"question":"A circle is inscribed in an equilateral triangle and another circle is circumscribed around the triangle. Find the area of the resulting ring if the side of the triangle is a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's an equilateral triangle with side length 'a'. Inside this triangle, there's a circle inscribed, and around the triangle, there's another circle circumscribed. I need to find the area of the ring that's formed between these two circles. Hmm, okay, so the ring is like the area between the bigger circumscribed circle and the smaller inscribed circle. So, to find that, I think I need to calculate the areas of both circles and then subtract the smaller one from the bigger one. That should give me the area of the ring.First, let me recall some properties of equilateral triangles. All sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. Also, the center of both the inscribed and circumscribed circles is the same point, which is the centroid of the triangle. So, both circles are concentric, meaning they share the same center. That makes things a bit simpler because I don't have to worry about different centers.Now, I need to find the radii of both the inscribed and circumscribed circles. Once I have those, I can compute their areas and subtract. Let's start with the inscribed circle, which is also called the incircle. The radius of the incircle in a triangle is given by the formula r = A/s, where A is the area of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter.Wait, let me make sure I remember that correctly. Yeah, for any triangle, the radius of the incircle is area divided by semi-perimeter. So, for an equilateral triangle, maybe there's a simpler formula? Let me think. Since all sides are equal, the semi-perimeter would be (3a)/2. The area of an equilateral triangle is (sqrt(3)/4) * a². So, plugging that into the formula, r = (sqrt(3)/4 * a²) / (3a/2). Let me compute that.Simplify numerator and denominator: sqrt(3)/4 divided by 3/2 is the same as sqrt(3)/4 multiplied by 2/3, which is sqrt(3)/6. So, the inradius r is (sqrt(3)/6) * a. Okay, that seems right. I think I've seen that formula before for equilateral triangles.Now, moving on to the circumscribed circle, which is called the circumcircle. The radius of the circumcircle for a triangle is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides and A is the area. But since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so a = b = c. So, R = (a³)/(4*A). Let me compute that.We already know the area A is (sqrt(3)/4)*a². So, plugging that in, R = (a³)/(4*(sqrt(3)/4)*a²). Let's simplify that. The 4 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, so we have R = a³/(sqrt(3)*a²). The a² cancels with a³, leaving R = a/sqrt(3). Hmm, but usually, we rationalize the denominator, so that would be (a*sqrt(3))/3. Okay, so R is (a*sqrt(3))/3.Wait, let me double-check that. Another way to find the circumradius in an equilateral triangle is using the formula R = a/(sqrt(3)). But sometimes, I see it written as R = (a*sqrt(3))/3. Let me confirm. Since sqrt(3)/3 is the same as 1/sqrt(3), right? Because sqrt(3)/3 is equal to sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)) which is 1/sqrt(3). So, both expressions are equivalent. So, R can be written as a/sqrt(3) or (a*sqrt(3))/3. Maybe the second one is preferable because it's rationalized.So, to recap, the inradius r is (sqrt(3)/6)*a, and the circumradius R is (sqrt(3)/3)*a. So, R is twice as big as r? Let me see: (sqrt(3)/3) is twice (sqrt(3)/6). Yes, exactly. So, R = 2r. That makes sense because in an equilateral triangle, the centroid is also the circumcenter and inradius, and the distance from the center to a vertex is twice the distance from the center to a side.Okay, so now I have both radii. The area of the ring is the area of the circumcircle minus the area of the incircle. So, area_ring = πR² - πr². Let's compute that.First, compute R²: [(sqrt(3)/3)*a]² = (3/9)*a² = (1/3)*a².Then, compute r²: [(sqrt(3)/6)*a]² = (3/36)*a² = (1/12)*a².So, plugging back into the area: π*(1/3 a²) - π*(1/12 a²) = π*(1/3 - 1/12) a².Compute 1/3 - 1/12: 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 - 1/12 = 3/12 = 1/4.Therefore, area_ring = π*(1/4)*a² = (π a²)/4.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify each step.First, inradius r: (sqrt(3)/6)*a. Squared: (3/36)*a² = 1/12 a². Correct.Circumradius R: (sqrt(3)/3)*a. Squared: (3/9)*a² = 1/3 a². Correct.Subtracting: 1/3 - 1/12 = 4/12 - 1/12 = 3/12 = 1/4. So, area is π*(1/4)*a². So, (π a²)/4. Hmm, that seems right.Alternatively, I can think of it as π(R² - r²) = π[( (sqrt(3)/3 a )² - ( sqrt(3)/6 a )²] = π[ (1/3 a² - 1/12 a²) ] = π*(1/4 a²). Yep, same result.So, the area of the ring is (π a²)/4.Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because intuitively, the ring area is between two circles, one with radius R and the other with radius r. So, the area should be π(R² - r²). Which is exactly what I did.But just to be thorough, let me compute R² - r²:R² = (sqrt(3)/3 a)² = (3/9)a² = 1/3 a².r² = (sqrt(3)/6 a)² = (3/36)a² = 1/12 a².So, R² - r² = 1/3 a² - 1/12 a² = (4/12 - 1/12) a² = 3/12 a² = 1/4 a².So, π times that is π*(1/4 a²) = (π a²)/4.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using trigonometry or coordinate geometry, but I think the way I did it is straightforward.Wait, another way: in an equilateral triangle, the centroid divides the height in a 2:1 ratio. So, the inradius is one-third of the height, and the circumradius is two-thirds of the height.Let me compute the height of the triangle first. The height h can be found by splitting the equilateral triangle into two 30-60-90 triangles. So, the height h = (sqrt(3)/2)*a.Therefore, the inradius r is one-third of h: r = (sqrt(3)/2 * a)/3 = sqrt(3)/6 * a. Which matches what I had earlier.Similarly, the circumradius R is two-thirds of h: R = (sqrt(3)/2 * a)*(2/3) = sqrt(3)/3 * a. Again, same as before.So, that confirms the radii. Then, the area between the circles is π(R² - r²) = π( (sqrt(3)/3 a)^2 - (sqrt(3)/6 a)^2 ) = π( (1/3 a²) - (1/12 a²) ) = π(1/4 a²). So, same result.Therefore, I think I can be confident that the area of the ring is (π a²)/4.Wait, just to make sure, let me plug in a numerical value for a and see if the areas make sense.Suppose a = 2. Then, the inradius r = sqrt(3)/6 * 2 = sqrt(3)/3 ≈ 0.577. The circumradius R = sqrt(3)/3 * 2 ≈ 1.154.Compute the areas:Area of incircle: π*(sqrt(3)/3)^2 * 2²? Wait, no. Wait, if a=2, then r = sqrt(3)/6 * 2 = sqrt(3)/3 ≈ 0.577. So, area is π*(sqrt(3)/3)^2 = π*(3/9) = π/3 ≈ 1.047.Area of circumcircle: π*(sqrt(3)/3 * 2)^2 = π*( (2 sqrt(3)/3)^2 ) = π*(4*3)/9 = π*(12/9) = 4π/3 ≈ 4.188.So, the ring area would be 4π/3 - π/3 = 3π/3 = π ≈ 3.1416.Alternatively, using the formula (π a²)/4 with a=2: (π *4)/4 = π, which matches. So, that checks out.Another test: a=1. Then, r = sqrt(3)/6 ≈ 0.2887, R = sqrt(3)/3 ≈ 0.577.Area of incircle: π*(sqrt(3)/6)^2 = π*(3/36) = π/12 ≈ 0.2618.Area of circumcircle: π*(sqrt(3)/3)^2 = π*(3/9) = π/3 ≈ 1.0472.Ring area: π/3 - π/12 = (4π - π)/12 = 3π/12 = π/4 ≈ 0.7854.Using the formula (π a²)/4 with a=1: π*1/4 = π/4 ≈ 0.7854. Perfect, same result.So, that seems to confirm that the formula is correct.Therefore, the area of the resulting ring is (π a²)/4.**Final Answer**The area of the resulting ring is boxed{dfrac{pi a^2}{4}}."},{"question":"Among the numbers frac{11}{3}, 0, sqrt{2}, 3.1415926, sqrt[3]{-27}, and frac{π}{5}, the number of irrational numbers is ( ).A: 4B: 3C: 2D: 1","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here that asks me to figure out how many of the given numbers are irrational. The numbers listed are: 11/3, 0, sqrt(2), 3.1415926, cube root of -27, and pi/5. The options are A:4, B:3, C:2, D:1. Hmm, okay. Let me take this step by step.First, I need to remember what an irrational number is. From what I recall, an irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. In other words, it cannot be written as a ratio of two integers. These numbers have decimal expansions that neither terminate nor become periodic. So, examples include sqrt(2), pi, e, and so on.Alright, so let me go through each number one by one and determine if it's irrational or not.1. **11/3**: This is a fraction, right? 11 divided by 3. Since both 11 and 3 are integers, this is a rational number. Its decimal expansion is 3.666..., which is a repeating decimal. So, definitely rational.2. **0**: Zero is an integer, and integers are rational numbers because they can be expressed as a fraction where the denominator is 1. So, 0 is rational.3. **sqrt(2)**: This is the square root of 2. I remember that sqrt(2) is an irrational number because it cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. Its decimal expansion goes on forever without repeating. So, sqrt(2) is irrational.4. **3.1415926**: Hmm, this looks familiar. Isn't that an approximation of pi? Pi is approximately 3.1415926535... and so on. But wait, this number is given as 3.1415926, which is a finite decimal. So, does that make it rational? Yes, because any decimal that terminates is a rational number. So, 3.1415926 is rational.5. **cube root of -27**: Let me compute that. The cube root of -27 is the number which, when multiplied by itself three times, gives -27. Well, (-3)^3 is -27, so the cube root of -27 is -3. That's an integer, so it's definitely a rational number.6. **pi/5**: Pi is an irrational number, right? So, if we divide pi by 5, is that still irrational? Let me think. If you take an irrational number and divide it by a non-zero rational number, the result is still irrational. Because if pi/5 were rational, then pi would be equal to 5 times that rational number, which would make pi rational. But pi is irrational, so pi/5 must also be irrational.Okay, so let me recap:- 11/3: Rational- 0: Rational- sqrt(2): Irrational- 3.1415926: Rational- cube root of -27: Rational- pi/5: IrrationalSo, out of the six numbers, how many are irrational? Let's count: sqrt(2) and pi/5. That's two numbers. Wait, is that right? So, the answer should be 2, which is option C.But hold on, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. **11/3**: Yep, definitely rational. 11 divided by 3 is 3.666..., repeating.2. **0**: Zero is rational because it can be written as 0/1.3. **sqrt(2)**: Correct, irrational. I remember this from the proof by contradiction where assuming sqrt(2) is rational leads to a contradiction.4. **3.1415926**: It's a finite decimal, so it's rational. It's just an approximation of pi, but since it stops at the sixth decimal place, it's a terminating decimal, hence rational.5. **cube root of -27**: That's -3, which is an integer, so rational.6. **pi/5**: Pi is irrational, and dividing it by 5 doesn't make it rational. So, yes, irrational.So, yeah, only two irrational numbers: sqrt(2) and pi/5. So, the number of irrational numbers is 2, which is option C.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me think about 3.1415926 again. Is that exactly equal to pi? No, because pi is approximately 3.1415926535... So, 3.1415926 is just a finite decimal, which is rational. So, that's correct.Is there any chance that pi/5 is actually rational? Hmm, pi is approximately 3.1415926535..., so pi/5 is approximately 0.6283185307..., which is non-terminating and non-repeating. So, yes, it's irrational.Wait, what about sqrt(2)? That's definitely irrational. So, yeah, two numbers.Wait, hold on, is 3.1415926 a rational number? Because it's a finite decimal, yes, it's rational. So, that's correct.So, I think my initial conclusion is right. There are two irrational numbers here: sqrt(2) and pi/5. So, the answer is C:2.But wait, hold on, let me check the cube root of -27 again. Cube root of -27 is -3, which is rational. So, that's correct.Is 11/3 rational? Yes, because it's a fraction of two integers.0 is rational.So, yeah, only two irrational numbers. So, the answer is C:2.But wait, hold on, let me make sure about pi/5. Is pi/5 irrational? Yes, because pi is irrational, and dividing an irrational number by a non-zero rational number (5) doesn't make it rational. So, pi/5 is irrational.So, yeah, I think I'm confident now. The number of irrational numbers is 2, which is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"At a women's doubles tennis tournament, there were three teams of  two women. After the tournament, each woman shook hands once with each of the other players except her partner. What is the number of handshakes that occurred?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of women participating in the tournament. Since there are three teams and each team consists of two women, there are a total of 3 multiplied by 2, which equals 6 women.Next, I'll calculate the total number of possible handshakes if every woman shakes hands with every other woman. This can be done using the combination formula C(n, 2), where n is the total number of women. Plugging in the numbers, C(6, 2) equals 15 handshakes.However, each woman does not shake hands with her own partner. Since there are three teams, there are three pairs of partners who do not shake hands with each other. Therefore, I need to subtract these three handshakes from the total.Finally, subtracting the three partner handshakes from the total of 15 gives me 12 handshakes that actually occurred during the tournament."},{"question":"Jimmy runs a successful pizza shop.

I think this is a quadratic equation, right? Because it has a ( z^2 ) term. So, I remember that quadratic equations can be written in the standard form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ). First, I need to rearrange the given equation to match that standard form. So, starting with ( z^2 = 12z - 7 ), I should subtract ( 12z ) and add 7 to both sides to get everything on one side. Let me do that step by step.Subtracting ( 12z ) from both sides gives me ( z^2 - 12z = -7 ). Then, adding 7 to both sides, I get ( z^2 - 12z + 7 = 0 ). Okay, so now it's in the standard quadratic form: ( z^2 - 12z + 7 = 0 ). Now, I remember that for any quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sum of the roots (which are the solutions for ( z )) is given by ( -b/a ). Is that right? Let me recall. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, in this case, ( a ) is the coefficient of ( z^2 ), which is 1, and ( b ) is the coefficient of ( z ), which is -12. So, plugging into the formula, the sum of the roots should be ( -(-12)/1 ), which simplifies to 12. Hmm, so does that mean the sum of all values of ( z ) that satisfy the equation is 12? That seems straightforward. Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should solve the quadratic equation to find the actual roots and then add them to confirm. That way, I can make sure I didn't make a mistake with the formula.Alright, let's solve ( z^2 - 12z + 7 = 0 ) using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is ( z = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ). Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -12 ), and ( c = 7 ). Plugging these values in, we get:( z = frac{-(-12) pm sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4(1)(7)}}{2(1)} )Simplifying the numerator:First, ( -(-12) ) is 12. Then, inside the square root, ( (-12)^2 ) is 144, and ( 4ac ) is ( 4*1*7 = 28 ). So, subtracting, we have ( 144 - 28 = 116 ). So, the expression becomes:( z = frac{12 pm sqrt{116}}{2} )Simplify ( sqrt{116} ). Let me see, 116 can be broken down into 4*29, right? So, ( sqrt{4*29} = 2sqrt{29} ). Therefore, substituting back, we have:( z = frac{12 pm 2sqrt{29}}{2} )We can factor out a 2 in the numerator:( z = frac{2(6 pm sqrt{29})}{2} )The 2's cancel out, so we're left with:( z = 6 pm sqrt{29} )So, the two solutions are ( z = 6 + sqrt{29} ) and ( z = 6 - sqrt{29} ). Now, let's add these two solutions together to find the sum. ( (6 + sqrt{29}) + (6 - sqrt{29}) = 6 + 6 + sqrt{29} - sqrt{29} )The ( sqrt{29} ) terms cancel each other out, leaving:( 12 )So, the sum of all values of ( z ) is indeed 12. That matches what I got earlier using the formula for the sum of roots. Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me go through the quadratic formula steps again.Starting with ( z^2 - 12z + 7 = 0 ), so ( a = 1 ), ( b = -12 ), ( c = 7 ). Quadratic formula: ( z = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Plugging in:( z = frac{-(-12) pm sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4*1*7}}{2*1} )Simplify:( z = frac{12 pm sqrt{144 - 28}}{2} )( z = frac{12 pm sqrt{116}}{2} )Simplify ( sqrt{116} ) as ( 2sqrt{29} ):( z = frac{12 pm 2sqrt{29}}{2} )Divide numerator terms by 2:( z = 6 pm sqrt{29} )Yes, that all checks out. So, adding the two roots:( (6 + sqrt{29}) + (6 - sqrt{29}) = 12 )Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I use the sum of roots formula or solve the quadratic and add the solutions, I get the same result. I think I'm confident now that the sum is 12. It's interesting because sometimes when you have irrational roots, you might think the sum would be something complicated, but in this case, the irrational parts cancel each other out, leaving a nice whole number. Just to recap, the key steps were:1. Recognize the equation is quadratic.2. Rewrite it in standard form.3. Use the sum of roots formula or solve for the roots and add them.4. Verify the result by solving the quadratic equation explicitly.This problem reinforces the importance of knowing the properties of quadratic equations, like the sum and product of roots, which can save time instead of having to find each root individually. But it's also good to verify by solving, especially if you're unsure or want to make sure you didn't make a mistake with the formula.Another thing I noticed is that the quadratic equation didn't factor nicely, which is why we ended up with irrational roots. If it had factored nicely, maybe the sum would have been more obvious, but in this case, it required a bit more work. I wonder, what if the equation was different? Like, if the coefficients were different, would the sum still be 12? Probably not, because the sum depends on the coefficients. So, in general, for any quadratic equation ( z^2 + bz + c = 0 ), the sum is ( -b ). Since in our case, the equation was ( z^2 - 12z + 7 = 0 ), the sum is ( -(-12) = 12 ). So, that's a good takeaway. Next time I see a quadratic equation, I can quickly find the sum of the roots without having to solve for them, which can be handy in more complex problems where solving for each root might not be feasible or necessary.But in this case, since the problem specifically asked for the sum, using the formula was the most efficient method. However, going through the process of solving the quadratic equation also helped me confirm that the answer was correct. It's always a good practice to verify your results, especially when dealing with mathematical problems.I also remember that the product of the roots is ( c/a ). In this case, that would be ( 7/1 = 7 ). So, if I multiply the two roots ( (6 + sqrt{29})(6 - sqrt{29}) ), I should get 7. Let me check that:( (6 + sqrt{29})(6 - sqrt{29}) = 6^2 - (sqrt{29})^2 = 36 - 29 = 7 )Yes, that works out. So, that's another way to verify the roots. If their product is 7 and their sum is 12, then they must be the correct roots for the equation.This problem was a good exercise in applying quadratic equation properties and verifying the results through multiple methods. It's also a reminder of how useful Vieta's formulas can be in quickly determining the sum and product of roots without having to solve the equation entirely.I think I've covered all the bases here. I've transformed the equation into standard form, applied Vieta's formula, solved the quadratic explicitly, verified the sum and product of the roots, and even reflected on why the answer makes sense. I feel confident that 12 is indeed the correct sum of all values of ( z ) satisfying the given equation.**Final Answer**The sum of all values of ( z ) is boxed{12}."},{"question":"The sum of the sequence 1+3+5+…+99 equals _____.","answer":"First, I recognize that the sequence 1 + 3 + 5 + … + 99 is an arithmetic series where each term increases by 2.To find the sum of this series, I need to determine the number of terms in the sequence. Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, ( a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d ), where ( a_1 = 1 ) and ( d = 2 ), I can solve for ( n ) when ( a_n = 99 ). This gives me ( n = 50 ).Now that I know there are 50 terms, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, ( S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) ). Plugging in the values, I calculate the sum as ( S_{50} = frac{50}{2}(1 + 99) = 25 times 100 = 2500 ).Therefore, the sum of the sequence is 2500."},{"question":"A certain school offers 4 elective courses in physical education and 4 elective courses in art. Students are required to choose 2 or 3 courses from these 8 courses, with at least 1 course from each category. The total number of different course selection schemes is ______ (answer in numerical form).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a school offering 4 elective courses in physical education and 4 in art. Students need to choose either 2 or 3 courses from these 8, but they have to pick at least 1 from each category. I need to figure out how many different course selection schemes there are. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, let me understand the requirements. There are two categories: physical education (PE) and art. Each has 4 courses. Students can choose either 2 or 3 courses in total, but they must have at least 1 course from each category. So, for example, if they choose 2 courses, they can't take both from PE or both from art; they have to take 1 PE and 1 art. Similarly, if they choose 3 courses, they can't take all 3 from PE or all 3 from art; they have to take either 1 PE and 2 art or 2 PE and 1 art.So, the problem is asking for the total number of different ways students can select their courses under these constraints. I think I can approach this by considering the two cases separately: selecting 2 courses and selecting 3 courses. Then, for each case, I'll calculate the number of valid combinations and add them together.Let me start with the case where students choose 2 courses. Since they need at least 1 from each category, the only valid combination is 1 PE and 1 art course. So, how many ways can they choose 1 PE course out of 4? That's a combination problem, right? The number of ways to choose 1 course from 4 is denoted as C(4,1). Similarly, the number of ways to choose 1 art course from 4 is also C(4,1). I remember that the combination formula is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, plugging in the numbers, C(4,1) = 4! / (1! * (4 - 1)!) = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 4. So, both C(4,1) for PE and C(4,1) for art are 4 each.Since these are independent choices, the total number of ways to choose 1 PE and 1 art course is 4 * 4 = 16. So, for the 2-course selection, there are 16 possible schemes.Now, moving on to the case where students choose 3 courses. Here, they have to choose at least 1 from each category, so the possible distributions are either 1 PE and 2 art courses or 2 PE and 1 art course. I'll calculate each of these separately and then add them together.First, let's compute the number of ways to choose 1 PE and 2 art courses. The number of ways to choose 1 PE course is C(4,1) = 4, as before. The number of ways to choose 2 art courses from 4 is C(4,2). Let me calculate that: C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24) / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. So, there are 6 ways to choose 2 art courses.Therefore, the number of ways to choose 1 PE and 2 art courses is 4 * 6 = 24.Next, let's compute the number of ways to choose 2 PE and 1 art course. Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 PE courses is C(4,2) = 6, as calculated above. The number of ways to choose 1 art course is C(4,1) = 4. So, the number of ways here is 6 * 4 = 24.Adding these two together, the total number of ways to choose 3 courses is 24 + 24 = 48.Now, to find the total number of different course selection schemes, I need to add the number of 2-course selections and 3-course selections. That would be 16 (for 2 courses) + 48 (for 3 courses) = 64.Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 2 courses, it's 4 * 4 = 16. That seems right. For 3 courses, 1 PE and 2 art is 4 * 6 = 24, and 2 PE and 1 art is 6 * 4 = 24. So, 24 + 24 = 48. Then, 16 + 48 = 64. Hmm, that seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me think about another approach. Maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of ways to choose 2 courses without any restrictions is C(8,2). Similarly, for 3 courses, it's C(8,3). But since we have the restriction of at least 1 from each category, we need to subtract the cases where all courses are from one category.Let me try this approach for both 2 and 3 courses.Starting with 2 courses: total without restrictions is C(8,2) = 28. The number of ways to choose 2 PE courses is C(4,2) = 6, and the number of ways to choose 2 art courses is also C(4,2) = 6. So, the number of invalid selections (all PE or all art) is 6 + 6 = 12. Therefore, the number of valid selections is 28 - 12 = 16. That matches my earlier result.Now, for 3 courses: total without restrictions is C(8,3) = 56. The number of ways to choose 3 PE courses is C(4,3) = 4, and the number of ways to choose 3 art courses is also C(4,3) = 4. So, the number of invalid selections is 4 + 4 = 8. Therefore, the number of valid selections is 56 - 8 = 48. Again, this matches my previous calculation.Adding these together, 16 + 48 = 64. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the combination numbers again.C(4,1) is 4, correct.C(4,2) is 6, correct.C(8,2) is 28, correct.C(8,3) is 56, correct.C(4,3) is 4, correct.So, all the individual combinations are correct, and the logic of subtracting the invalid cases seems sound.Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the multiplication principle for each case.For 2 courses: 1 PE and 1 art. So, 4 choices for PE, 4 choices for art, total 16.For 3 courses: Either 1 PE and 2 art or 2 PE and 1 art.1 PE: 4 choices, 2 art: C(4,2)=6, so 4*6=24.2 PE: C(4,2)=6, 1 art: 4 choices, so 6*4=24.Total for 3 courses: 24+24=48.Total overall: 16+48=64.Yes, that all adds up.I think I'm confident that 64 is the correct answer. It's always good to approach the problem from multiple angles to ensure that the result is consistent.**Final Answer**The total number of different course selection schemes is boxed{64}."},{"question":"Simplify first, then evaluate: [left(x+yright)^{2}-left(3x-yright)left(3x+yright)-2y^{2}]div left(-2xright), where x=-1 and y=-2.","answer":"Okay, so I have this algebra problem here: I need to simplify the expression [ (x + y)^2 - (3x - y)(3x + y) - 2y^2 ] divided by (-2x), and then evaluate it when x is -1 and y is -2. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.First, I remember that when simplifying expressions, it's usually best to handle the numerator first before dealing with the division. So, let me focus on the numerator: (x + y)^2 - (3x - y)(3x + y) - 2y^2. I think I can expand each part separately and then combine like terms.Starting with the first term, (x + y)^2. I know that formula: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So applying that here, it should be x^2 + 2xy + y^2. Got that down.Next, the second term is (3x - y)(3x + y). Hmm, that looks like a difference of squares because it's in the form (a - b)(a + b) which equals a^2 - b^2. So, applying that, it should be (3x)^2 - (y)^2, which is 9x^2 - y^2. Okay, so that simplifies nicely.Now, the third term is just -2y^2. That's straightforward; I don't think I need to do anything with that yet.So, putting it all together, the numerator becomes:(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) - (9x^2 - y^2) - 2y^2.Wait, hold on. I need to distribute the negative sign to both terms inside the parentheses. So, subtracting (9x^2 - y^2) is the same as -9x^2 + y^2. Let me write that out:x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 9x^2 + y^2 - 2y^2.Now, let's combine like terms. Let's group the x^2 terms, the xy terms, and the y^2 terms.For the x^2 terms: x^2 - 9x^2. That's (1 - 9)x^2, which is -8x^2.For the xy terms: There's only one term, which is 2xy.For the y^2 terms: y^2 + y^2 - 2y^2. Let's compute that: (1 + 1 - 2)y^2, which is 0y^2. So, the y^2 terms cancel out.So, after combining like terms, the numerator simplifies to -8x^2 + 2xy.Alright, so now the entire expression is (-8x^2 + 2xy) divided by (-2x). Let me write that as:(-8x^2 + 2xy) / (-2x).I think I can factor out a common factor from the numerator. Looking at -8x^2 and 2xy, I notice that both terms have a factor of -2x. Let me factor that out:-2x(4x - y) / (-2x).Wait, let me check that. If I factor out -2x from -8x^2, that would be (-2x)*4x = -8x^2. Then, factoring out -2x from 2xy: (-2x)*(-y) = 2xy. So, yes, that works.So, the numerator becomes -2x(4x - y), and the denominator is -2x. So, the expression simplifies to:[-2x(4x - y)] / (-2x).Now, I can cancel out the -2x in the numerator and the denominator. As long as x is not zero, which it isn't in this case because x is -1, we're good to go.So, canceling out -2x, we're left with (4x - y).So, the entire expression simplifies to 4x - y.Wait, that seems much simpler. So, instead of dealing with all that, it just becomes 4x - y. Nice.Now, I need to evaluate this simplified expression at x = -1 and y = -2.So, plugging in x = -1 and y = -2 into 4x - y:4*(-1) - (-2).Let me compute that step by step.First, 4*(-1) is -4.Then, subtracting (-2) is the same as adding 2.So, -4 + 2 equals -2.Wait, so the value of the expression is -2.Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with the numerator:(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2.(3x - y)(3x + y) = 9x^2 - y^2.So, numerator is x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 9x^2 + y^2 - 2y^2.Combine like terms: (x^2 - 9x^2) = -8x^2, (2xy) remains, (y^2 + y^2 - 2y^2) = 0.So, numerator is -8x^2 + 2xy.Divide by -2x: (-8x^2 + 2xy)/(-2x) = (-2x)(4x - y)/(-2x) = 4x - y.Plugging in x = -1, y = -2: 4*(-1) - (-2) = -4 + 2 = -2.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, just to be thorough, maybe I can plug in the values into the original expression before simplifying to see if I get the same result.Original expression: [ (x + y)^2 - (3x - y)(3x + y) - 2y^2 ] / (-2x).Plugging in x = -1 and y = -2:First, compute (x + y)^2: (-1 + (-2))^2 = (-3)^2 = 9.Next, compute (3x - y)(3x + y): 3*(-1) - (-2) = -3 + 2 = -1; 3*(-1) + (-2) = -3 - 2 = -5. So, (-1)*(-5) = 5.Then, compute -2y^2: -2*(-2)^2 = -2*4 = -8.So, numerator is 9 - 5 - 8.Compute that: 9 - 5 is 4; 4 - 8 is -4.Denominator is -2x: -2*(-1) = 2.So, the entire expression is (-4)/2 = -2.Same result as before. So, that confirms that the simplified expression is correct.Therefore, the value is -2.**Final Answer**The value of the expression is boxed{-2}."},{"question":"Given a circle C: x^{2}+y^{2}-2ax+4ay+5a^{2}-25=0 whose center lies on the line l_{1}: x+y+2=0, find the length of the chord formed by intersecting the circle C with the line l_{2}: 3x+4y-5=0.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a circle and two lines. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the circle is given by the equation ( x^{2} + y^{2} - 2ax + 4ay + 5a^{2} - 25 = 0 ). Hmm, I remember that the general equation of a circle is ( x^{2} + y^{2} + Dx + Ey + F = 0 ), and its center is at ( (-D/2, -E/2) ) with radius ( sqrt{(D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 - F} ). So, let me rewrite the given equation to match the general form.Comparing, I see that ( D = -2a ), ( E = 4a ), and ( F = 5a^{2} - 25 ). Therefore, the center of the circle should be at ( (-(-2a)/2, -4a/2) ) which simplifies to ( (a, -2a) ). Okay, so the center is ( (a, -2a) ). The problem says that this center lies on the line ( l_{1} ): ( x + y + 2 = 0 ). That means if I plug the coordinates of the center into this line equation, it should satisfy it.Let me do that: substituting ( x = a ) and ( y = -2a ) into ( x + y + 2 = 0 ), we get ( a + (-2a) + 2 = 0 ). Simplifying, that's ( -a + 2 = 0 ), so ( -a = -2 ), which means ( a = 2 ). Got it, so ( a ) is 2. That helps because now I can write the specific equation of the circle.Substituting ( a = 2 ) into the original equation: ( x^{2} + y^{2} - 2*2x + 4*2y + 5*(2)^2 - 25 = 0 ). Let me compute each term:- ( -2*2x = -4x )- ( 4*2y = 8y )- ( 5*(2)^2 = 5*4 = 20 )- So, the equation becomes ( x^{2} + y^{2} - 4x + 8y + 20 - 25 = 0 )- Simplify the constants: 20 - 25 = -5- So, the circle equation is ( x^{2} + y^{2} - 4x + 8y - 5 = 0 )Let me write that down: ( x^{2} + y^{2} - 4x + 8y - 5 = 0 ). Now, I can find the center and radius of this circle. The center is ( (a, -2a) ) which with ( a = 2 ) is ( (2, -4) ). The radius is ( sqrt{(D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 - F} ). Let me compute that.From the equation, ( D = -4 ), ( E = 8 ), ( F = -5 ).So, ( D/2 = -2 ), ( E/2 = 4 ).Thus, radius squared is ( (-2)^2 + 4^2 - (-5) = 4 + 16 + 5 = 25 ). Therefore, the radius is ( sqrt{25} = 5 ). So, the circle has center at (2, -4) and radius 5.Now, the problem asks for the length of the chord formed by intersecting this circle with the line ( l_{2} ): ( 3x + 4y - 5 = 0 ). Okay, so I need to find the points where the line intersects the circle and then compute the distance between these two points, which will be the length of the chord.Alternatively, I remember that there's a formula for the length of a chord given the radius and the distance from the center to the line. The formula is ( 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} ), where ( r ) is the radius and ( d ) is the distance from the center to the line. That might be quicker than finding the intersection points.Let me try that approach. First, I need to find the distance ( d ) from the center (2, -4) to the line ( 3x + 4y - 5 = 0 ). The formula for the distance from a point ( (x_0, y_0) ) to the line ( Ax + By + C = 0 ) is ( frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} ).So, in this case, ( A = 3 ), ( B = 4 ), ( C = -5 ). The center is ( (2, -4) ). Plugging into the formula:( d = frac{|3*2 + 4*(-4) - 5|}{sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}} )Let me compute the numerator:3*2 = 64*(-4) = -16So, 6 -16 -5 = 6 -16 is -10, then -10 -5 is -15. The absolute value is 15.Denominator: sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5.So, ( d = 15 / 5 = 3 ). So, the distance from the center to the line is 3 units.Now, since the radius is 5, the length of the chord is ( 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} = 2sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = 2sqrt{25 - 9} = 2sqrt{16} = 2*4 = 8 ).Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the chord length is 8 units.But just to make sure, maybe I should verify by finding the points of intersection and computing the distance.Let me try that method as well.So, we have the circle equation: ( x^{2} + y^{2} - 4x + 8y - 5 = 0 )And the line equation: ( 3x + 4y - 5 = 0 ). Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other. Maybe solve for y.From the line equation: ( 3x + 4y = 5 ) => ( 4y = 5 - 3x ) => ( y = (5 - 3x)/4 )Now, substitute this into the circle equation.So, ( x^{2} + [(5 - 3x)/4]^2 - 4x + 8*[(5 - 3x)/4] - 5 = 0 )Let me compute each term step by step.First, ( x^{2} ) remains as is.Second term: ( [(5 - 3x)/4]^2 = (25 - 30x + 9x^2)/16 )Third term: -4x remains as is.Fourth term: 8*[(5 - 3x)/4] = 2*(5 - 3x) = 10 - 6xFifth term: -5 remains as is.So, putting it all together:( x^{2} + (25 - 30x + 9x^2)/16 - 4x + 10 - 6x - 5 = 0 )Let me combine like terms.First, let's write all terms with denominators:( x^{2} + (9x^2 - 30x + 25)/16 - 4x + 10 - 6x - 5 = 0 )Let me get rid of the denominator by multiplying the entire equation by 16:16x^2 + 9x^2 - 30x + 25 - 64x + 160 - 96x - 80 = 0Wait, let me check that:Multiplying each term by 16:- ( x^{2} *16 = 16x^2 )- ( (9x^2 - 30x + 25)/16 *16 = 9x^2 - 30x +25 )- ( -4x *16 = -64x )- ( 10*16 = 160 )- ( -6x*16 = -96x )- ( -5*16 = -80 )So, putting it all together:16x^2 + 9x^2 - 30x +25 -64x +160 -96x -80 = 0Now, combine like terms:16x^2 + 9x^2 = 25x^2-30x -64x -96x = (-30 -64 -96)x = (-190)x25 + 160 -80 = 25 + 80 = 105So, the equation becomes:25x^2 - 190x + 105 = 0Let me see if I can simplify this quadratic equation. Let's try dividing all terms by 5:25x^2 /5 = 5x^2-190x /5 = -38x105 /5 = 21So, simplified equation: 5x^2 -38x +21 = 0Now, let's solve for x using quadratic formula.Quadratic equation: 5x^2 -38x +21 = 0Discriminant D = b^2 -4ac = (-38)^2 -4*5*21 = 1444 - 420 = 1024sqrt(D) = sqrt(1024) = 32So, solutions:x = [38 ±32]/(2*5) = [38 ±32]/10So, two solutions:x = (38 +32)/10 = 70/10 =7x = (38 -32)/10 =6/10 = 3/5 = 0.6So, x =7 and x= 0.6.Now, let's find the corresponding y values using the line equation ( y = (5 -3x)/4 ).First, for x=7:y = (5 -3*7)/4 = (5 -21)/4 = (-16)/4 = -4So, one point is (7, -4)Second, for x=0.6 (which is 3/5):y = (5 -3*(3/5))/4 = (5 - 9/5)/4 = (25/5 -9/5)/4 = (16/5)/4 = (16/5)*(1/4) = 4/5 = 0.8So, the other point is (3/5, 4/5) or (0.6, 0.8)Now, we have two points of intersection: (7, -4) and (0.6, 0.8). Let's compute the distance between these two points.The distance formula is sqrt[(x2 -x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]So, let me compute the differences:x2 -x1 = 0.6 -7 = -6.4y2 - y1 = 0.8 - (-4) = 0.8 +4 =4.8So, the distance squared is (-6.4)^2 + (4.8)^2Compute each:(-6.4)^2 = 40.96(4.8)^2 = 23.04Sum: 40.96 +23.04 =64So, sqrt(64)=8Therefore, the distance between the two points is 8 units, which confirms the chord length is 8.So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.Therefore, the length of the chord is 8.**Final Answer**The length of the chord is boxed{8}."},{"question":"The number of students who won the first prize in the senior high school math competition is between 30 and 55.

The math scores X (unit: points) of a test follow a normal distribution N(80, sigma ^{2}). The number of students with scores in the range [80, 90] is 16. Find the number of students with scores above 90.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a class of 48 students. Their math scores, X, follow a normal distribution with a mean of 80 and some variance σ². The problem says that 16 students scored between 80 and 90, and I need to find out how many students scored above 90.Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, since the scores are normally distributed, I know that the distribution is symmetric around the mean, which is 80. So, the probability of scoring above 80 is the same as scoring below 80, right? That would each be 50%.But in this case, the number of students scoring between 80 and 90 is 16. Since there are 48 students in total, 16 is exactly one-third of the class. Wait, no, 16 divided by 48 is actually one-third. Hmm, that's interesting. So, 16 students scored between 80 and 90, which is a third of the class.I need to figure out how many scored above 90. Let me think about how to approach this. Since the distribution is normal, I can use z-scores to find probabilities. The z-score formula is (X - μ)/σ, where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.So, let's denote the z-score for 90 as z. Then, z = (90 - 80)/σ = 10/σ. I need to find the probability that a score is between 80 and 90, which is the same as the probability that a z-score is between 0 and z. Since 16 out of 48 students scored in that range, that's a probability of 16/48, which simplifies to 1/3 or approximately 0.3333.So, P(0 < Z < z) = 1/3. I can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the z-value that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 1/3 above the mean.Wait, actually, the cumulative probability from the left up to z is P(Z < z). So, if P(0 < Z < z) = 1/3, then P(Z < z) = P(Z < 0) + P(0 < Z < z) = 0.5 + 1/3 ≈ 0.8333.So, I need to find z such that Φ(z) = 0.8333, where Φ is the cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution.Looking at the z-table, let me recall that Φ(0.95) is approximately 0.8289 and Φ(1.0) is about 0.8413. Hmm, so 0.8333 is somewhere between 0.95 and 1.0. Maybe around 0.96 or 0.97.Alternatively, I can use linear approximation. Let's see:Φ(0.95) = 0.8289Φ(0.96) = ?Looking it up, Φ(0.96) is approximately 0.8314.Φ(0.97) is approximately 0.8359.Wait, so Φ(0.96) ≈ 0.8314 and Φ(0.97) ≈ 0.8359.Our target is 0.8333. So, let's see how much we need to go beyond 0.96.The difference between Φ(0.97) and Φ(0.96) is approximately 0.8359 - 0.8314 = 0.0045.We need to cover 0.8333 - 0.8314 = 0.0019.So, the fraction is 0.0019 / 0.0045 ≈ 0.4222.Therefore, the z-score is approximately 0.96 + 0.4222*(0.01) ≈ 0.96 + 0.0042 ≈ 0.9642.So, z ≈ 0.9642.Therefore, z = 10/σ ≈ 0.9642.So, solving for σ: σ ≈ 10 / 0.9642 ≈ 10.37.So, the standard deviation is approximately 10.37 points.Now, with σ known, I can find the probability that a student scored above 90. That is, P(X > 90).Again, using the z-score: z = (90 - 80)/σ ≈ 10 / 10.37 ≈ 0.9642.So, P(Z > 0.9642) = 1 - Φ(0.9642) ≈ 1 - 0.8333 = 0.1667.So, approximately 16.67% of the students scored above 90.Since there are 48 students, the number of students scoring above 90 is 48 * 0.1667 ≈ 8.Wait, 48 * 0.1667 is 8 exactly, because 48 * (1/6) = 8. So, that makes sense.But let me double-check my calculations because 16 students scored between 80 and 90, which is 1/3 of the class, and then 8 students scored above 90, which is 1/6 of the class. So, the distribution is symmetric around 80, so below 80 should also be 1/2, which is 24 students. Then, between 80 and 90 is 16, so above 90 is 8, and below 80 is 24. Let's check: 24 + 16 + 8 = 48, which matches the total number of students.Wait, hold on, actually, if below 80 is 24, between 80 and 90 is 16, and above 90 is 8, that adds up to 48. So, that seems consistent.But let me think again about the z-score. I found that z ≈ 0.9642, which corresponds to a probability of about 0.8333, so the area above that is 0.1667, which is 1/6. So, 1/6 of 48 is 8. So, that seems correct.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since the distribution is symmetric, the area above 80 is 0.5, and the area between 80 and 90 is 1/3, so the area above 90 must be 0.5 - 1/3 = 1/6, which is approximately 0.1667. So, 1/6 of 48 is 8.So, that seems consistent.Therefore, the number of students scoring above 90 is 8.But let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my z-score calculation.So, starting again, P(80 < X < 90) = 16/48 = 1/3.Since the distribution is normal with mean 80, P(X < 80) = 0.5, so P(X < 90) = P(X < 80) + P(80 < X < 90) = 0.5 + 1/3 ≈ 0.8333.Therefore, P(X < 90) ≈ 0.8333, so the z-score corresponding to 0.8333 is approximately 0.9642, as I found earlier.Therefore, P(X > 90) = 1 - 0.8333 ≈ 0.1667, which is 1/6.So, 48 * (1/6) = 8.Therefore, the number of students with scores above 90 is 8.I think that makes sense. So, the answer is 8 students.**Final Answer**The number of students with scores above 90 is boxed{8}."},{"question":"Let S_{n} be the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}. If 2S_{3}=3S_{2}+6, then the common difference d=____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ( S_n ) be the sum of the first ( n ) terms of an arithmetic sequence ( {a_n} ). It says that ( 2S_3 = 3S_2 + 6 ), and I need to find the common difference ( d ). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the sum of the first ( n ) terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:[S_n = frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]]where ( a_1 ) is the first term and ( d ) is the common difference. Alternatively, I also recall that the sum can be written as:[S_n = frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)]since the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms gives the sum. Maybe both formulas will come in handy here.Let me write down the expressions for ( S_3 ) and ( S_2 ) using the first formula. For ( S_3 ):[S_3 = frac{3}{2} [2a_1 + (3 - 1)d] = frac{3}{2} [2a_1 + 2d]]Simplifying that, I get:[S_3 = frac{3}{2} times 2(a_1 + d) = 3(a_1 + d)]Wait, that seems right because the sum of three terms is 3 times the average of the first and third term, which is ( a_1 + d ).Similarly, for ( S_2 ):[S_2 = frac{2}{2} [2a_1 + (2 - 1)d] = 1 times [2a_1 + d] = 2a_1 + d]Okay, so ( S_2 = 2a_1 + d ).Now, the problem states that ( 2S_3 = 3S_2 + 6 ). Let me substitute the expressions I found for ( S_3 ) and ( S_2 ) into this equation.Substituting:[2 times 3(a_1 + d) = 3 times (2a_1 + d) + 6]Simplify both sides:Left side: ( 6(a_1 + d) )Right side: ( 6a_1 + 3d + 6 )So, the equation becomes:[6a_1 + 6d = 6a_1 + 3d + 6]Hmm, let's subtract ( 6a_1 ) from both sides to eliminate the ( a_1 ) terms:[6d = 3d + 6]Now, subtract ( 3d ) from both sides:[3d = 6]Divide both sides by 3:[d = 2]So, the common difference ( d ) is 2. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the sum formulas, I correctly substituted ( n = 3 ) and ( n = 2 ). Then, I expanded both expressions correctly. Plugging into the given equation, I multiplied correctly and simplified both sides. Subtracting ( 6a_1 ) cancels out the ( a_1 ) terms, leaving me with an equation in terms of ( d ) only. Solving that gives ( d = 2 ). Seems solid.Alternatively, just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this using the other sum formula ( S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) ). Let's see if I get the same result.First, ( S_3 = frac{3}{2}(a_1 + a_3) ). Since ( a_3 = a_1 + 2d ), substituting that in:[S_3 = frac{3}{2}(a_1 + a_1 + 2d) = frac{3}{2}(2a_1 + 2d) = 3(a_1 + d)]Same as before.Similarly, ( S_2 = frac{2}{2}(a_1 + a_2) = 1 times (a_1 + (a_1 + d)) = 2a_1 + d ). Same result.So, plugging into ( 2S_3 = 3S_2 + 6 ):[2 times 3(a_1 + d) = 3 times (2a_1 + d) + 6]Which simplifies to:[6a_1 + 6d = 6a_1 + 3d + 6]Subtract ( 6a_1 ):[6d = 3d + 6]Subtract ( 3d ):[3d = 6]Divide by 3:[d = 2]Yep, same answer. So, that seems to confirm it.Just to make sure, maybe I can plug ( d = 2 ) back into the original expressions and see if the equation holds.Let me compute ( S_3 ) and ( S_2 ) with ( d = 2 ).First, ( S_3 = 3(a_1 + d) = 3(a_1 + 2) ).( S_2 = 2a_1 + d = 2a_1 + 2 ).Now, compute ( 2S_3 ) and ( 3S_2 + 6 ):( 2S_3 = 2 times 3(a_1 + 2) = 6a_1 + 12 ).( 3S_2 + 6 = 3 times (2a_1 + 2) + 6 = 6a_1 + 6 + 6 = 6a_1 + 12 ).So, both sides equal ( 6a_1 + 12 ), which means the equation holds true. Therefore, ( d = 2 ) is indeed the correct common difference.I think that's thorough enough. I considered two different approaches using the sum formulas, both leading to the same result, and even checked by plugging back into the original equation. So, I'm confident that ( d = 2 ).**Final Answer**The common difference ( d ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"The regular hexagon (ABCDEF) has diagonals (AC) and (CE).

The diagonals (AC) and (CE) are given, and there are points (M) and (N) inside these diagonals such that the ratios (AM:AC = CN:CE = r). I need to find (r) given that points (B), (M), and (N) are collinear.First, I should probably visualize the regular hexagon. I know that in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal, and all internal angles are 120 degrees. The diagonals in a regular hexagon have specific properties too. For example, the diagonals that connect every other vertex are longer and are equal in length.Let me label the hexagon vertices as (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F) in order. So, the diagonals mentioned are (AC) and (CE). Diagonal (AC) connects vertex (A) to vertex (C), and diagonal (CE) connects vertex (C) to vertex (E). Points (M) and (N) are internal points on (AC) and (CE) respectively, such that (AM:AC = r) and (CN:CE = r). So, (M) divides (AC) in the ratio (r:(1-r)), and (N) divides (CE) in the ratio (r:(1-r)).Since the hexagon is regular, I can assign coordinates to the vertices to make calculations easier. Let me place the hexagon on a coordinate system with the center at the origin. Let’s assume the side length of the hexagon is 1 for simplicity. Then, the coordinates of the vertices can be determined using trigonometric functions.In a regular hexagon, each vertex can be represented as ((costheta, sintheta)) where (theta) is the angle from the positive x-axis. Since a hexagon has six sides, each vertex is separated by 60 degrees.Let me assign the coordinates:- (A) is at ((1, 0))- (B) is at ((cos(60°), sin(60°)) = (0.5, sqrt{3}/2))- (C) is at ((cos(120°), sin(120°)) = (-0.5, sqrt{3}/2))- (D) is at ((-1, 0))- (E) is at ((cos(240°), sin(240°)) = (-0.5, -sqrt{3}/2))- (F) is at ((cos(300°), sin(300°)) = (0.5, -sqrt{3}/2))So, now I have coordinates for all the vertices.Next, I need to find the coordinates of points (M) and (N). Since (M) divides (AC) in the ratio (r:1-r), I can use the section formula to find its coordinates. Similarly, (N) divides (CE) in the same ratio.Let me compute the coordinates of (M) first. The coordinates of (A) are ((1, 0)) and (C) are ((-0.5, sqrt{3}/2)). The section formula says that a point dividing a line segment in the ratio (m:n) has coordinates:[left( frac{m x_2 + n x_1}{m + n}, frac{m y_2 + n y_1}{m + n} right)]In this case, (M) divides (AC) in the ratio (r:1-r), so (m = r) and (n = 1 - r). Therefore, the coordinates of (M) are:[x_M = frac{r times (-0.5) + (1 - r) times 1}{r + (1 - r)} = frac{-0.5r + 1 - r}{1} = 1 - 1.5r][y_M = frac{r times (sqrt{3}/2) + (1 - r) times 0}{1} = frac{r sqrt{3}/2}{1} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} r]So, (M) is at ((1 - 1.5r, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} r)).Now, let's find the coordinates of (N). Point (N) divides (CE) in the ratio (r:1-r). The coordinates of (C) are ((-0.5, sqrt{3}/2)) and (E) are ((-0.5, -sqrt{3}/2)). Applying the section formula again:[x_N = frac{r times (-0.5) + (1 - r) times (-0.5)}{1} = frac{-0.5r - 0.5(1 - r)}{1} = frac{-0.5r - 0.5 + 0.5r}{1} = -0.5][y_N = frac{r times (-sqrt{3}/2) + (1 - r) times (sqrt{3}/2)}{1} = frac{ - r sqrt{3}/2 + sqrt{3}/2 - r sqrt{3}/2 }{1} = frac{ sqrt{3}/2 - r sqrt{3} }{1 } = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(1 - 2r)]So, (N) is at ((-0.5, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(1 - 2r))).Now, we have coordinates for (B), (M), and (N). The problem states that these three points are collinear. So, the slope between (B) and (M) should be equal to the slope between (B) and (N).Let me compute the coordinates again for clarity:- (B) is at ((0.5, sqrt{3}/2))- (M) is at ((1 - 1.5r, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} r))- (N) is at ((-0.5, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(1 - 2r)))First, let me compute the slope between (B) and (M):Slope (BM) is:[m_{BM} = frac{y_M - y_B}{x_M - x_B} = frac{ frac{sqrt{3}}{2} r - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} }{1 - 1.5r - 0.5} = frac{ frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(r - 1) }{0.5 - 1.5r }]Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(r - 1))Denominator: (0.5 - 1.5r = 0.5(1 - 3r))So,[m_{BM} = frac{ frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(r - 1) }{ 0.5(1 - 3r) } = frac{ sqrt{3}(r - 1) }{ 1 - 3r } = frac{ sqrt{3}( - (1 - r) ) }{ 1 - 3r } = frac{ - sqrt{3}(1 - r) }{ 1 - 3r }]So, (m_{BM} = frac{ - sqrt{3}(1 - r) }{ 1 - 3r })Now, let me compute the slope between (B) and (N):Slope (BN) is:[m_{BN} = frac{y_N - y_B}{x_N - x_B} = frac{ frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(1 - 2r) - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} }{ -0.5 - 0.5 } = frac{ frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(1 - 2r - 1) }{ -1 } = frac{ frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(-2r) }{ -1 } = frac{ - sqrt{3} r }{ -1 } = sqrt{3} r]So, (m_{BN} = sqrt{3} r)Since points (B), (M), and (N) are collinear, their slopes must be equal. Therefore:[m_{BM} = m_{BN}][frac{ - sqrt{3}(1 - r) }{ 1 - 3r } = sqrt{3} r]Let me solve this equation for (r). First, I can divide both sides by (sqrt{3}) to simplify:[frac{ - (1 - r) }{ 1 - 3r } = r]Multiply both sides by (1 - 3r) (assuming (1 - 3r neq 0), which I should check later):[- (1 - r) = r (1 - 3r)][-1 + r = r - 3r^2]Subtract (r) from both sides:[-1 = -3r^2][-1 = -3r^2]Multiply both sides by (-1):[1 = 3r^2][r^2 = frac{1}{3}][r = pm frac{sqrt{3}}{3}]But since (r) is a ratio of lengths, it must be positive and less than 1 (since (M) and (N) are internal points). Therefore, (r = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}).Wait, hold on. Let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with slopes, especially with negative signs, it's easy to make a mistake.Let me go back to the equation:[frac{ - (1 - r) }{ 1 - 3r } = r]Multiply both sides by (1 - 3r):Left side: (- (1 - r))Right side: (r (1 - 3r))So,[-1 + r = r - 3r^2]Subtract (r) from both sides:[-1 = -3r^2]Multiply both sides by (-1):[1 = 3r^2]So, (r^2 = 1/3), so (r = sqrt{1/3}) or (r = -sqrt{1/3}). Since (r) is positive, (r = sqrt{1/3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}).But let me check if (1 - 3r) is zero when (r = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}). Compute (1 - 3*(sqrt(3)/3) = 1 - sqrt(3)). Since sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 1 - 1.732 is approximately -0.732, which is not zero. So, no division by zero issue here.Therefore, (r = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}).But wait, let me think again. The problem says that (M) and (N) are internal points, so (r) must be between 0 and 1. Since (sqrt{3}/3 approx 0.577), which is between 0 and 1, so that's acceptable.But just to make sure, let me plug (r = sqrt{3}/3) back into the coordinates of (M) and (N) and see if the slopes indeed match.Compute coordinates of (M):(x_M = 1 - 1.5r = 1 - 1.5*(sqrt(3)/3) = 1 - (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 1 - 0.866 ≈ 0.134)(y_M = (sqrt(3)/2)*r = (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/3) = (3/2)/3 = 1/2 ≈ 0.5)So, (M) is approximately at (0.134, 0.5)Coordinates of (N):(x_N = -0.5)(y_N = (sqrt(3)/2)*(1 - 2r) = (sqrt(3)/2)*(1 - 2*(sqrt(3)/3)) = (sqrt(3)/2)*(1 - (2 sqrt(3))/3))Compute (1 - (2 sqrt(3))/3 ≈ 1 - 1.1547 ≈ -0.1547)So, (y_N ≈ (sqrt(3)/2)*(-0.1547) ≈ (1.732/2)*(-0.1547) ≈ 0.866*(-0.1547) ≈ -0.134)So, (N) is approximately at (-0.5, -0.134)Now, let me compute the slope between (B) and (M):(B) is at (0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866)(M) is at (0.134, 0.5)Slope (BM = (0.5 - 0.866)/(0.134 - 0.5) ≈ (-0.366)/(-0.366) ≈ 1)Wait, that's interesting. So, the slope is 1.Now, compute the slope between (B) and (N):(B) is at (0.5, 0.866)(N) is at (-0.5, -0.134)Slope (BN = (-0.134 - 0.866)/(-0.5 - 0.5) = (-1)/(-1) = 1)So, both slopes are 1, which confirms that the points are collinear. Therefore, (r = sqrt{3}/3) is indeed the correct value.But wait, let me express (sqrt{3}/3) as (1/sqrt{3}), which is the same thing. Sometimes, rationalized denominators are preferred, but both are correct.Alternatively, (sqrt{3}/3) is approximately 0.577, which is less than 1, so it's a valid ratio.Therefore, after going through the calculations step by step and verifying the slopes, I can conclude that (r = sqrt{3}/3).**Final Answer**The value of (r) is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}}."},{"question":"Given the complex number z that satisfies the equation i cdot z = 3 - 4i (where i is the imaginary unit), find the value of |z|.","answer":"To solve for ( z ) in the equation ( i cdot z = 3 - 4i ), I need to isolate ( z ).

The buyer will pay the full price if Chris covers the car maintenance inspection, which costs a tenth of the asking price. Calculating the inspection cost: 1/10 of 5,200 is 520. Therefore, Chris's earnings from the first buyer are 5,200 minus 520, which equals 4,680.For the second buyer, the asking price is also 5,200. The buyer will pay the full price if Chris replaces the headlights and tires. The headlights cost 80, and the tires cost three times that amount, which is 240.

I need to find all non-negative integer solutions for (x) and (y). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I should probably try to rearrange the equation to make it easier to handle. Maybe I can collect like terms or factor something out. Let me look at the equation again:(2x^2 + 2xy - x + y = 2020)I notice that there are terms with (y) in them: (2xy) and (y). Maybe I can factor out (y) from those terms. Let's try that:(2x^2 + y(2x + 1) - x = 2020)Hmm, that seems a bit better. So now, the equation is:(2x^2 - x + y(2x + 1) = 2020)Maybe I can solve for (y) in terms of (x). Let me try that. So, moving the (2x^2 - x) to the other side:(y(2x + 1) = 2020 - 2x^2 + x)Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me double-check. If I have:(2x^2 - x + y(2x + 1) = 2020)Then, subtracting (2x^2 - x) from both sides gives:(y(2x + 1) = 2020 - 2x^2 + x)Yes, that's correct. So, now, solving for (y):(y = frac{2020 - 2x^2 + x}{2x + 1})Hmm, okay. So (y) must be an integer, right? Since we're looking for integer solutions. So, the right-hand side must be an integer. Therefore, the numerator must be divisible by the denominator, which is (2x + 1).So, (2x + 1) divides (2020 - 2x^2 + x). Let me write that as:(2x + 1 mid 2020 - 2x^2 + x)Hmm, maybe I can perform polynomial division or find some way to express this divisibility condition.Alternatively, perhaps I can express the numerator in terms of the denominator. Let me try to manipulate the numerator:(2020 - 2x^2 + x)Let me factor out a negative sign:(-2x^2 + x + 2020)Hmm, maybe I can write this as a multiple of (2x + 1) plus some remainder. Let me try polynomial division.Divide (-2x^2 + x + 2020) by (2x + 1).First, divide (-2x^2) by (2x), which gives (-x). Multiply (2x + 1) by (-x) to get (-2x^2 - x). Subtract that from the original numerator:(-2x^2 + x + 2020 - (-2x^2 - x) = (-2x^2 + x + 2020) + 2x^2 + x = 2x + 2020)So now, the remainder is (2x + 2020). Now, divide this by (2x + 1). Divide (2x) by (2x), which is 1. Multiply (2x + 1) by 1 to get (2x + 1). Subtract that from the remainder:(2x + 2020 - (2x + 1) = 2019)So, the division gives:(-2x^2 + x + 2020 = (2x + 1)(-x + 1) + 2019)Therefore, the numerator is equal to ((2x + 1)(-x + 1) + 2019). So, going back to the expression for (y):(y = frac{(2x + 1)(-x + 1) + 2019}{2x + 1})Which can be written as:(y = -x + 1 + frac{2019}{2x + 1})So, for (y) to be an integer, (frac{2019}{2x + 1}) must be an integer. Therefore, (2x + 1) must be a divisor of 2019.Okay, so now, I need to find all positive divisors of 2019, since (2x + 1) is positive (because (x) is a non-negative integer, so (2x + 1 geq 1)).First, let's factorize 2019 to find all its divisors.2019 ÷ 3 = 673. So, 2019 = 3 × 673.Now, is 673 a prime number? Let me check.Well, 673 is not even, doesn't end with 5, so not divisible by 2 or 5. Let's check divisibility by primes up to sqrt(673). Sqrt of 676 is 26, so sqrt(673) is a bit less than 26. So, primes up to 23.673 ÷ 3 = 224.333... Not integer.673 ÷ 7 = 96.142... Not integer.673 ÷ 11 = 61.181... Not integer.673 ÷ 13 = 51.769... Not integer.673 ÷ 17 = 39.588... Not integer.673 ÷ 19 = 35.421... Not integer.673 ÷ 23 = 29.26... Not integer.So, 673 is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of 2019 is 3 × 673.Therefore, the positive divisors of 2019 are 1, 3, 673, and 2019.So, (2x + 1) can be 1, 3, 673, or 2019.Let me list these possibilities:Case 1: (2x + 1 = 1)Then, solving for (x):(2x + 1 = 1 Rightarrow 2x = 0 Rightarrow x = 0)Then, plugging back into the expression for (y):(y = -0 + 1 + frac{2019}{1} = 1 + 2019 = 2020)So, one solution is (x = 0), (y = 2020).Case 2: (2x + 1 = 3)Solving for (x):(2x + 1 = 3 Rightarrow 2x = 2 Rightarrow x = 1)Then, (y = -1 + 1 + frac{2019}{3} = 0 + 673 = 673)So, another solution is (x = 1), (y = 673).Case 3: (2x + 1 = 673)Solving for (x):(2x + 1 = 673 Rightarrow 2x = 672 Rightarrow x = 336)Then, (y = -336 + 1 + frac{2019}{673})Calculating (frac{2019}{673}):Since 673 × 3 = 2019, so (frac{2019}{673} = 3)Therefore, (y = -336 + 1 + 3 = -336 + 4 = -332)Wait, that's negative. But we're looking for non-negative integer solutions. So, (y = -332) is invalid. Therefore, this case doesn't give a valid solution.Case 4: (2x + 1 = 2019)Solving for (x):(2x + 1 = 2019 Rightarrow 2x = 2018 Rightarrow x = 1009)Then, (y = -1009 + 1 + frac{2019}{2019})Calculating (frac{2019}{2019} = 1)So, (y = -1009 + 1 + 1 = -1007)Again, negative. So, (y = -1007) is invalid. Therefore, this case also doesn't give a valid solution.So, from the four cases, only the first two give non-negative integer solutions.Therefore, the solutions are:1. (x = 0), (y = 2020)2. (x = 1), (y = 673)Wait, but let me double-check these solutions in the original equation to make sure.First, checking (x = 0), (y = 2020):Left-hand side: (2(0)^2 + 2(0)(2020) - 0 + 2020 = 0 + 0 - 0 + 2020 = 2020), which equals the right-hand side. So, that's correct.Next, checking (x = 1), (y = 673):Left-hand side: (2(1)^2 + 2(1)(673) - 1 + 673 = 2 + 1346 - 1 + 673)Calculating step by step:2 + 1346 = 13481348 - 1 = 13471347 + 673 = 2020Which equals the right-hand side. So, that's correct too.Now, just to make sure I didn't miss any other divisors, let me think again about the divisors of 2019.2019 is 3 × 673, both primes, so the positive divisors are indeed 1, 3, 673, 2019. So, I considered all possible cases.Therefore, the only non-negative integer solutions are (x = 0), (y = 2020) and (x = 1), (y = 673).Wait, but just to be thorough, what if (2x + 1) is a negative divisor of 2019? Since 2019 is positive, its negative divisors would be -1, -3, -673, -2019. But since (x) is a non-negative integer, (2x + 1) must be at least 1, so negative divisors don't make sense here. So, we don't need to consider them.Therefore, I think I have found all possible solutions.**Final Answer**The non-negative integer solutions are (boxed{(0, 2020)}) and (boxed{(1, 673)})."},{"question":"If x, y in mathbb{R}^+ and x + 3y = 5xy, find the minimum value of 3x + 4y.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of 3x + 4y given that x and y are positive real numbers and they satisfy the equation x + 3y = 5xy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down what I know:We have two variables, x and y, both positive real numbers. They satisfy the equation:x + 3y = 5xy.And we need to find the minimum value of the expression:3x + 4y.Alright, so I need to minimize 3x + 4y subject to the constraint x + 3y = 5xy. This sounds like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that in such cases, methods like substitution or using Lagrange multipliers can be helpful. Since it's a bit simpler, maybe substitution would work here.Let me try to express one variable in terms of the other using the constraint equation. Let's solve for x in terms of y.Starting with:x + 3y = 5xy.Let me rearrange this equation to solve for x:x = 5xy - 3y.Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try again.Starting with:x + 3y = 5xy.I can write this as:x = 5xy - 3y.But that still has x on both sides. Maybe I should factor out y on the right-hand side.So,x = y(5x - 3).Hmm, but x is still on both sides. Maybe I should get all terms involving x on one side.Let me subtract 5xy from both sides:x - 5xy + 3y = 0.Factor out x from the first two terms:x(1 - 5y) + 3y = 0.Hmm, that gives:x(1 - 5y) = -3y.So, solving for x:x = (-3y)/(1 - 5y).But since x and y are positive real numbers, the denominator (1 - 5y) must be negative because the numerator is negative (-3y). So, 1 - 5y < 0 implies that 5y > 1, so y > 1/5.Okay, so y must be greater than 1/5. Let me write x in terms of y:x = (-3y)/(1 - 5y) = (3y)/(5y - 1).Because I factored out a negative from both numerator and denominator.So, x = (3y)/(5y - 1).Now, since x is positive, and y > 1/5, the denominator 5y - 1 is positive, so x is positive as required.Alright, now I can express 3x + 4y in terms of y alone.Given that x = (3y)/(5y - 1), substitute into 3x + 4y:3x + 4y = 3*(3y)/(5y - 1) + 4y.Let me compute that:= (9y)/(5y - 1) + 4y.Hmm, so now I have an expression in terms of y. Let me write it as a single function:f(y) = (9y)/(5y - 1) + 4y.I need to find the minimum value of f(y) for y > 1/5.To find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f(y) with respect to y, set it equal to zero, and solve for y.Let me compute f'(y):First, f(y) = (9y)/(5y - 1) + 4y.Let me differentiate term by term.The derivative of (9y)/(5y - 1):Using the quotient rule: d/dy [u/v] = (u'v - uv')/v².Here, u = 9y, so u' = 9.v = 5y - 1, so v' = 5.Thus, derivative is:(9*(5y - 1) - 9y*5)/(5y - 1)^2.Simplify numerator:= [45y - 9 - 45y]/(5y - 1)^2= (-9)/(5y - 1)^2.Okay, so derivative of the first term is -9/(5y - 1)^2.Now, derivative of the second term, 4y, is 4.Therefore, f'(y) = (-9)/(5y - 1)^2 + 4.Set f'(y) = 0 to find critical points:(-9)/(5y - 1)^2 + 4 = 0.Let me solve for y:(-9)/(5y - 1)^2 = -4.Multiply both sides by (5y - 1)^2:-9 = -4*(5y - 1)^2.Divide both sides by -1:9 = 4*(5y - 1)^2.Divide both sides by 4:(9)/4 = (5y - 1)^2.Take square roots:sqrt(9/4) = |5y - 1|.Which gives:3/2 = |5y - 1|.So, 5y - 1 = 3/2 or 5y - 1 = -3/2.But since y > 1/5, 5y - 1 is positive, so we can discard the negative solution.Thus, 5y - 1 = 3/2.Solve for y:5y = 3/2 + 1 = 5/2.So, y = (5/2)/5 = 1/2.Okay, so y = 1/2 is a critical point. Let me check if this is a minimum.I can use the second derivative test or analyze the behavior of f'(y). Let me compute the second derivative.First, f'(y) = (-9)/(5y - 1)^2 + 4.Compute f''(y):Derivative of (-9)/(5y - 1)^2 is:Let me write it as -9*(5y - 1)^(-2).So, derivative is (-9)*(-2)*(5y - 1)^(-3)*5.Simplify:= 90/(5y - 1)^3.And derivative of 4 is 0.Thus, f''(y) = 90/(5y - 1)^3.At y = 1/2, compute f''(1/2):5y - 1 = 5*(1/2) - 1 = 5/2 - 1 = 3/2.So, f''(1/2) = 90/(3/2)^3 = 90/(27/8) = 90*(8/27) = (90/27)*8 = (10/3)*8 = 80/3.Which is positive, so the function is concave upward at y = 1/2, meaning it's a local minimum.Since the function tends to infinity as y approaches 1/5 from the right and as y approaches infinity, this local minimum is indeed the global minimum.So, now, let's compute the value of f(y) at y = 1/2.f(1/2) = (9*(1/2))/(5*(1/2) - 1) + 4*(1/2).Compute each term:First term: (9/2)/(5/2 - 1) = (9/2)/(3/2) = (9/2)*(2/3) = 3.Second term: 4*(1/2) = 2.So, f(1/2) = 3 + 2 = 5.Therefore, the minimum value of 3x + 4y is 5.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.First, x when y = 1/2:x = (3y)/(5y - 1) = (3*(1/2))/(5*(1/2) - 1) = (3/2)/(5/2 - 2/2) = (3/2)/(3/2) = 1.So, x = 1, y = 1/2.Compute 3x + 4y: 3*1 + 4*(1/2) = 3 + 2 = 5. Yep, that's correct.Let me also verify the constraint:x + 3y = 1 + 3*(1/2) = 1 + 3/2 = 5/2.5xy = 5*1*(1/2) = 5/2.So, 5/2 = 5/2, which satisfies the equation.Alright, so everything checks out.Therefore, the minimum value is 5.**Final Answer**The minimum value of (3x + 4y) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"Construct a rectangular open-top water pool with a volume of 8m^{3} and a depth of 2m. If the cost of the pool bottom and walls per square meter is 120 and 80, respectively, what is the minimum construction cost?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how to construct a rectangular open-top water pool with a volume of 8 cubic meters and a depth of 2 meters. The goal is to minimize the construction cost, considering that the bottom costs 120 per square meter and the walls cost 80 per square meter. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the pool. It's a rectangular prism, open at the top, so it has a base (the bottom) and four walls. The depth is given as 2 meters, which is the height of the prism. The volume is 8 cubic meters, so I can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism to relate the dimensions.The volume ( V ) is given by:[ V = text{length} times text{width} times text{depth} ]We know ( V = 8 , m^3 ) and depth ( h = 2 , m ). Let me denote the length as ( x ) and the width as ( y ). So, plugging in the known values:[ 8 = x times y times 2 ]Simplifying this:[ x times y = frac{8}{2} = 4 ]So, the product of length and width is 4 square meters. That gives me a relationship between ( x ) and ( y ):[ y = frac{4}{x} ]I can use this later when setting up the cost function.Now, moving on to the cost. The pool has a bottom and four walls. The cost of the bottom is 120 per square meter, and the cost of the walls is 80 per square meter. I need to calculate the total cost as a function of ( x ) and ( y ), then find its minimum.Let me calculate the area of the bottom first. The bottom is a rectangle with length ( x ) and width ( y ), so its area is:[ text{Area}_{text{bottom}} = x times y ]We already know this is 4 square meters, so the cost for the bottom is:[ text{Cost}_{text{bottom}} = 4 times 120 = 480 , text{dollars} ]Wait, hold on. Is that right? If I express the cost in terms of ( x ) and ( y ), it's ( 120 times x times y ). But since ( x times y = 4 ), it's indeed 480 dollars. So the bottom cost is fixed? Hmm, interesting.Now, the walls. There are four walls: two with dimensions ( x times h ) and two with dimensions ( y times h ). Since the depth ( h ) is 2 meters, each pair of walls has areas ( 2x ) and ( 2y ). So, the total area of the walls is:[ text{Area}_{text{walls}} = 2 times (x times 2) + 2 times (y times 2) = 4x + 4y ]Wait, let me verify that. Each of the two longer walls has area ( x times h = x times 2 ), so two of them would be ( 2 times 2x = 4x ). Similarly, each of the two shorter walls has area ( y times 2 ), so two of them would be ( 2 times 2y = 4y ). So, total area is ( 4x + 4y ). That seems correct.Therefore, the cost for the walls is:[ text{Cost}_{text{walls}} = (4x + 4y) times 80 ]Simplifying:[ text{Cost}_{text{walls}} = 80 times (4x + 4y) = 320x + 320y ]So, the total cost ( C ) is the sum of the bottom cost and the walls cost:[ C = 480 + 320x + 320y ]But since we have a relationship between ( x ) and ( y ) from the volume, which is ( y = frac{4}{x} ), I can substitute this into the cost equation to express ( C ) solely in terms of ( x ).Substituting ( y = frac{4}{x} ) into the cost equation:[ C = 480 + 320x + 320 times left( frac{4}{x} right) ]Simplifying:[ C = 480 + 320x + frac{1280}{x} ]So, the cost function is:[ C(x) = 480 + 320x + frac{1280}{x} ]Now, I need to find the value of ( x ) that minimizes this cost. Since ( x ) is a positive real number (as it's a length), I can use calculus to find the minimum.First, let's find the derivative of ( C(x) ) with respect to ( x ):[ C'(x) = frac{d}{dx} left( 480 + 320x + frac{1280}{x} right) ]Calculating term by term:- The derivative of 480 is 0.- The derivative of ( 320x ) is 320.- The derivative of ( frac{1280}{x} ) is ( -frac{1280}{x^2} ).So, putting it all together:[ C'(x) = 320 - frac{1280}{x^2} ]To find the critical points, set ( C'(x) = 0 ):[ 320 - frac{1280}{x^2} = 0 ]Solving for ( x ):[ 320 = frac{1280}{x^2} ]Multiply both sides by ( x^2 ):[ 320x^2 = 1280 ]Divide both sides by 320:[ x^2 = frac{1280}{320} = 4 ]Taking the square root of both sides:[ x = sqrt{4} = 2 ]Since ( x ) must be positive, we discard the negative root.Now, we should check if this critical point is indeed a minimum. We can do this by using the second derivative test.First, compute the second derivative ( C''(x) ):[ C''(x) = frac{d}{dx} left( 320 - frac{1280}{x^2} right) ]Calculating term by term:- The derivative of 320 is 0.- The derivative of ( -frac{1280}{x^2} ) is ( frac{2560}{x^3} ).So,[ C''(x) = frac{2560}{x^3} ]Since ( x > 0 ), ( C''(x) ) is positive, which means the function is concave upward at this point, confirming that ( x = 2 ) is a point of local minimum.Therefore, the minimum cost occurs when ( x = 2 ) meters. Now, let's find the corresponding ( y ) using the earlier relationship:[ y = frac{4}{x} = frac{4}{2} = 2 ]So, both the length and the width are 2 meters. That means the pool is actually a square in terms of its base, with sides of 2 meters each.Now, let's compute the total cost at ( x = 2 ):[ C(2) = 480 + 320 times 2 + frac{1280}{2} ]Calculating each term:- ( 320 times 2 = 640 )- ( frac{1280}{2} = 640 )So,[ C(2) = 480 + 640 + 640 = 1760 ]Therefore, the minimum construction cost is 1760.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me double-check the cost function:Given ( x = 2 ), ( y = 2 ), so:- Bottom area: 2 * 2 = 4, cost: 4 * 120 = 480- Walls: There are two walls of 2m (length) * 2m (height) and two walls of 2m (width) * 2m (height). So each pair is 4m², so total walls area: 4 + 4 = 8m². Cost: 8 * 80 = 640- Total cost: 480 + 640 = 1120? Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation.Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.If ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 2 ), then:- The bottom area is indeed 4m², costing 4 * 120 = 480.- The walls: There are two walls with area ( x times h = 2 * 2 = 4 ) each, so two walls contribute 8m². Similarly, the other two walls are ( y times h = 2 * 2 = 4 ) each, contributing another 8m². So total walls area is 8 + 8 = 16m². Therefore, walls cost is 16 * 80 = 1280.Wait, so total cost is 480 + 1280 = 1760. That matches my earlier calculation. So why did I get confused?Because when I substituted ( x = 2 ) into the cost function ( C(x) = 480 + 320x + 1280/x ), I got 480 + 640 + 640 = 1760. But when I tried to compute walls area directly, I initially miscalculated the number of walls. So, the correct walls area is 16m², leading to 1280, plus the bottom 480, totaling 1760. So, my initial calculation was correct.Therefore, the minimum cost is indeed 1760.But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other critical points or if the function behaves correctly.We found that ( x = 2 ) is the only critical point, and since the second derivative is positive, it's a minimum. As ( x ) approaches 0, the term ( 1280/x ) goes to infinity, so the cost increases without bound. As ( x ) approaches infinity, the term ( 320x ) goes to infinity, so the cost also increases without bound. Therefore, the function has a single minimum at ( x = 2 ).Thus, the minimal cost is 1760.**Final Answer**The minimum construction cost is boxed{1760} dollars."},{"question":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} where the sum of the first five terms S_5 = 25 and a_2 = 3, find the value of a_4.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the value of ( a_4 ) in an arithmetic sequence where the sum of the first five terms ( S_5 = 25 ) and the second term ( a_2 = 3 ). Hmm, arithmetic sequences... let me recall what I know about them.An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, if the first term is ( a_1 ) and the common difference is ( d ), then the nth term ( a_n ) can be expressed as:( a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d )Right, so for example, ( a_2 = a_1 + d ), ( a_3 = a_1 + 2d ), and so on.Given that ( a_2 = 3 ), I can write that as:( a_1 + d = 3 )  ...(1)Also, the sum of the first five terms ( S_5 = 25 ). The formula for the sum of the first ( n ) terms of an arithmetic sequence is:( S_n = frac{n}{2} times (2a_1 + (n - 1)d) )So, plugging in ( n = 5 ):( S_5 = frac{5}{2} times (2a_1 + 4d) = 25 )Let me simplify that:First, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:( 5 times (2a_1 + 4d) = 50 )Divide both sides by 5:( 2a_1 + 4d = 10 )  ...(2)Now, I have two equations:1. ( a_1 + d = 3 )2. ( 2a_1 + 4d = 10 )I can solve these simultaneously. Let's see, equation (1) can be rearranged to express ( a_1 ) in terms of ( d ):( a_1 = 3 - d )Now, substitute this into equation (2):( 2(3 - d) + 4d = 10 )Let me expand this:( 6 - 2d + 4d = 10 )Combine like terms:( 6 + 2d = 10 )Subtract 6 from both sides:( 2d = 4 )Divide both sides by 2:( d = 2 )Okay, so the common difference ( d ) is 2. Now, substitute ( d = 2 ) back into equation (1):( a_1 + 2 = 3 )Subtract 2 from both sides:( a_1 = 1 )So, the first term ( a_1 ) is 1 and the common difference ( d ) is 2.Now, the question asks for ( a_4 ). Using the formula for the nth term:( a_4 = a_1 + (4 - 1)d = a_1 + 3d )Plugging in the values:( a_4 = 1 + 3 times 2 = 1 + 6 = 7 )So, ( a_4 = 7 ).Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, ( a_1 = 1 ), ( d = 2 ). So:- ( a_1 = 1 )- ( a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3 ) (which matches the given information)- ( a_3 = 1 + 4 = 5 )- ( a_4 = 1 + 6 = 7 )- ( a_5 = 1 + 8 = 9 )Now, let's check the sum of the first five terms:( S_5 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 )Yes, that adds up to 25, which is correct.So, my answer should be 7.**Final Answer**The value of ( a_4 ) is boxed{7}."},{"question":"Given that (x) is a simplest proper fraction, if its numerator is increased by (a), it simplifies to (frac{1}{3}); if its denominator is increased by (a), it simplifies to (frac{1}{4}). Find (x).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find a simplest proper fraction ( x ). The problem says that if I increase the numerator by ( a ), the fraction simplifies to ( frac{1}{3} ). And if I increase the denominator by ( a ), it simplifies to ( frac{1}{4} ). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me denote the fraction ( x ) as ( frac{p}{q} ), where ( p ) is the numerator and ( q ) is the denominator. Since it's a simplest proper fraction, ( p ) and ( q ) must be coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1, and ( p < q ).Now, according to the problem, if I increase the numerator by ( a ), the fraction becomes ( frac{1}{3} ). So, mathematically, that can be written as:[frac{p + a}{q} = frac{1}{3}]Similarly, if I increase the denominator by ( a ), the fraction becomes ( frac{1}{4} ). So, that gives me another equation:[frac{p}{q + a} = frac{1}{4}]Alright, so now I have two equations:1. ( frac{p + a}{q} = frac{1}{3} )2. ( frac{p}{q + a} = frac{1}{4} )I need to solve these two equations to find ( p ) and ( q ), which will give me the fraction ( x = frac{p}{q} ).Let me rewrite these equations to make them easier to work with.From the first equation:[frac{p + a}{q} = frac{1}{3}]Cross-multiplying gives:[3(p + a) = q]Which simplifies to:[3p + 3a = q quad text{(Equation 1)}]From the second equation:[frac{p}{q + a} = frac{1}{4}]Cross-multiplying gives:[4p = q + a]Which simplifies to:[4p = q + a quad text{(Equation 2)}]Now, I have two equations:1. ( 3p + 3a = q )2. ( 4p = q + a )I can substitute ( q ) from Equation 1 into Equation 2. Let me do that.From Equation 1: ( q = 3p + 3a )Substitute into Equation 2:[4p = (3p + 3a) + a]Simplify the right side:[4p = 3p + 4a]Subtract ( 3p ) from both sides:[p = 4a]Okay, so ( p = 4a ). Now, let's substitute this back into Equation 1 to find ( q ).From Equation 1:[q = 3p + 3a = 3(4a) + 3a = 12a + 3a = 15a]So, ( q = 15a ).Therefore, the fraction ( x ) is:[x = frac{p}{q} = frac{4a}{15a}]Wait a second, ( x ) is given as a simplest proper fraction. So, ( frac{4a}{15a} ) simplifies to ( frac{4}{15} ) because the ( a ) cancels out. So, ( x = frac{4}{15} ).But hold on, let me make sure that ( frac{4}{15} ) is indeed a simplest proper fraction. The numerator is 4 and the denominator is 15. The GCD of 4 and 15 is 1, so yes, it's in simplest form. Also, 4 is less than 15, so it's a proper fraction. Perfect.Let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with ( p = 4a ) and ( q = 15a ).First condition: increasing numerator by ( a ):[frac{p + a}{q} = frac{4a + a}{15a} = frac{5a}{15a} = frac{1}{3}]That works.Second condition: increasing denominator by ( a ):[frac{p}{q + a} = frac{4a}{15a + a} = frac{4a}{16a} = frac{1}{4}]That also works.So, everything checks out. Therefore, the fraction ( x ) is ( frac{4}{15} ).I think that's the answer. It makes sense because when I plug it back into the conditions given, both simplify correctly. Also, since ( a ) cancels out in the fraction, it doesn't affect the final result, which is good because ( a ) isn't specified in the problem. So, regardless of the value of ( a ), the fraction ( x ) remains ( frac{4}{15} ).Just to recap, the steps were:1. Let ( x = frac{p}{q} ).2. Set up the two equations based on the given conditions.3. Solved the system of equations to find ( p = 4a ) and ( q = 15a ).4. Simplified ( frac{p}{q} ) to ( frac{4}{15} ).5. Verified the solution by plugging back into the original conditions.Everything seems consistent, so I'm confident that ( x = frac{4}{15} ) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The simplest proper fraction ( x ) is boxed{dfrac{4}{15}}."},{"question":"Convert 11101_{(2)} to base 5.","answer":"First, I need to convert the binary number (11101_{(2)}) to its decimal equivalent.

Let me think about how to approach this.First, let me write out the first few terms to get a sense of what's happening here.- The first term is 1/1^1, which is just 1.- The second term is 1/2^2, which is 1/4 or 0.25.- The third term is 1/3^3, which is 1/27, approximately 0.037.- The fourth term is 1/4^4, which is 1/256, about 0.0039.- The fifth term is 1/5^5, which is 1/3125, roughly 0.00032.Okay, so each subsequent term is getting really small, really quickly. That makes me think that the sum converges pretty fast, and maybe after a certain point, the terms are negligible when rounded to the nearest integer.Let me calculate the sum step by step, adding each term and seeing how the total progresses.Starting with the first term: 1.Adding the second term: 1 + 0.25 = 1.25.Adding the third term: 1.25 + 0.037 ≈ 1.287.Adding the fourth term: 1.287 + 0.0039 ≈ 1.2909.Adding the fifth term: 1.2909 + 0.00032 ≈ 1.29122.Hmm, so after five terms, we're already at approximately 1.29122. Let's keep going a bit more.The sixth term is 1/6^6. Let's compute that:6^6 is 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776, 7776*6=46656. So 1/46656 ≈ 0.000021433.Adding that to our total: 1.29122 + 0.000021433 ≈ 1.291241433.Seventh term: 1/7^7. Let's compute 7^7.7^2=49, 7^3=343, 7^4=2401, 7^5=16807, 7^6=117649, 7^7=823543. So 1/823543 ≈ 0.000001214.Adding that: 1.291241433 + 0.000001214 ≈ 1.291242647.Eighth term: 1/8^8. 8^8 is 8*8=64, 64*8=512, 512*8=4096, 4096*8=32768, 32768*8=262144, 262144*8=2097152, 2097152*8=16777216. So 1/16777216 ≈ 0.0000000596.Adding that: 1.291242647 + 0.0000000596 ≈ 1.2912427066.Ninth term: 1/9^9. 9^9 is 9*9=81, 81*9=729, 729*9=6561, 6561*9=59049, 59049*9=531441, 531441*9=4782969, 4782969*9=43046721, 43046721*9=387420489. So 1/387420489 ≈ 0.00000000258.Adding that: 1.2912427066 + 0.00000000258 ≈ 1.29124270918.Tenth term: 1/10^10. That's 1/10000000000, which is 0.0000000001.Adding that: 1.29124270918 + 0.0000000001 ≈ 1.29124270928.Okay, so after the tenth term, the sum is approximately 1.29124270928. Let's see how much more we have to add from the 11th term to the 100th term.Each term beyond the 10th is going to be extremely small. For example, the 11th term is 1/11^11. Let's compute 11^11.11^2=121, 11^3=1331, 11^4=14641, 11^5=161051, 11^6=1771561, 11^7=19487171, 11^8=214358881, 11^9=2357947691, 11^10=25937424601, 11^11=285311670611. So 1/285311670611 ≈ 3.504 x 10^-12.That's 0.000000000003504. Adding that to our total would barely change it. Similarly, the 12th term is 1/12^12, which is even smaller. 12^12 is 8916100448256, so 1/8916100448256 ≈ 1.121 x 10^-13.So, each subsequent term is getting smaller and smaller, each contributing less and less to the total sum. Therefore, the sum from n=11 to n=100 is going to be a very small number, almost negligible.But just to be thorough, let's try to estimate the total sum from n=11 to n=100.We can note that for n ≥ 2, 1/n^n is less than 1/2^n. Because n^n grows much faster than 2^n. So, the sum from n=11 to infinity of 1/n^n is less than the sum from n=11 to infinity of 1/2^n.The sum from n=11 to infinity of 1/2^n is a geometric series with first term 1/2^11 and common ratio 1/2. The sum is (1/2^11)/(1 - 1/2) = (1/2048)/(1/2) = 1/1024 ≈ 0.0009765625.So, the sum from n=11 to infinity is less than approximately 0.0009765625.But wait, actually, for n ≥ 11, 1/n^n is even smaller than 1/2^n, so the sum from n=11 to infinity is less than 0.0009765625.But in reality, since n^n grows so fast, the sum from n=11 to infinity is going to be much less than that. Let's compute a few more terms to get a better estimate.Compute the sum from n=11 to, say, n=20, and see how much that contributes.Compute 1/11^11 ≈ 3.504 x 10^-12.1/12^12 ≈ 1.121 x 10^-13.1/13^13: 13^13 is 13*13=169, 169*13=2197, 2197*13=28561, 28561*13=371293, 371293*13=4826809, 4826809*13=62748517, 62748517*13=815730721, 815730721*13=10604499373, 10604499373*13=137858491849, 137858491849*13=1792160394037. So 1/1792160394037 ≈ 5.58 x 10^-13.Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, 13^13 is actually 13 multiplied by itself 13 times. Let me compute 13^13 properly.13^1 = 1313^2 = 16913^3 = 219713^4 = 2856113^5 = 37129313^6 = 482680913^7 = 6274851713^8 = 81573072113^9 = 1060449937313^10 = 13785849184913^11 = 179216039403713^12 = 2329808512248113^13 = 302875106592253So, 1/13^13 ≈ 3.303 x 10^-15.Wait, that's even smaller. So, 1/13^13 ≈ 3.303 x 10^-15.Similarly, 1/14^14 is going to be even smaller.So, the terms beyond n=10 are getting extremely small, each contributing less than 10^-12, 10^-13, etc.Therefore, the sum from n=11 to n=100 is going to be less than, say, 10^-10 or even smaller.But let's try to get a better upper bound.We can note that for n ≥ 11, 1/n^n ≤ 1/11^n.So, the sum from n=11 to infinity of 1/n^n ≤ sum from n=11 to infinity of 1/11^n.That's a geometric series with first term 1/11^11 and common ratio 1/11.Sum = (1/11^11) / (1 - 1/11) = (1/11^11) / (10/11) = (1/11^10) / 10.Compute 11^10: 11^1=11, 11^2=121, 11^3=1331, 11^4=14641, 11^5=161051, 11^6=1771561, 11^7=19487171, 11^8=214358881, 11^9=2357947691, 11^10=25937424601.So, 1/11^10 ≈ 3.855 x 10^-11.Divide that by 10: 3.855 x 10^-12.Therefore, the sum from n=11 to infinity is less than approximately 3.855 x 10^-12.So, that's about 0.000000000003855.So, adding that to our previous total, which was approximately 1.29124270928, the total sum x is less than 1.29124270928 + 0.000000000003855 ≈ 1.291242709283855.Therefore, x is approximately 1.291242709283855.So, when rounding to the nearest integer, we look at the decimal part. The integer part is 1, and the decimal part is approximately 0.291242709283855.Since 0.2912 is less than 0.5, we round down. Therefore, x rounded to the nearest integer is 1.But wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with series, especially converging ones, it's easy to make a mistake in the estimation.I calculated the sum up to n=10 as approximately 1.29124270928. Then, I estimated the remaining sum from n=11 to infinity as less than 3.855 x 10^-12, which is negligible. So, the total sum is approximately 1.29124270928, which is about 1.29124.But wait, 1.29124 is approximately 1.29124, which is less than 1.5, so when rounded to the nearest integer, it's 1.But hold on, let me check if my initial sum up to n=10 is accurate.Let me recalculate the sum step by step:n=1: 1/1 = 1. Total: 1.n=2: 1/4 = 0.25. Total: 1.25.n=3: 1/27 ≈ 0.037037037. Total: 1.25 + 0.037037037 ≈ 1.287037037.n=4: 1/256 ≈ 0.00390625. Total: 1.287037037 + 0.00390625 ≈ 1.290943287.n=5: 1/3125 ≈ 0.00032. Total: 1.290943287 + 0.00032 ≈ 1.291263287.n=6: 1/46656 ≈ 0.000021433. Total: 1.291263287 + 0.000021433 ≈ 1.29128472.n=7: 1/823543 ≈ 0.000001214. Total: 1.29128472 + 0.000001214 ≈ 1.291285934.n=8: 1/16777216 ≈ 0.0000000596. Total: 1.291285934 + 0.0000000596 ≈ 1.2912859936.n=9: 1/387420489 ≈ 0.00000000258. Total: 1.2912859936 + 0.00000000258 ≈ 1.29128599618.n=10: 1/10000000000 = 0.0000000001. Total: 1.29128599618 + 0.0000000001 ≈ 1.29128599628.Wait, so my initial calculation was a bit off. I had 1.29124270928, but actually, it's approximately 1.29128599628.So, the sum up to n=10 is approximately 1.29128599628.Then, adding the sum from n=11 to infinity, which we estimated as less than 3.855 x 10^-12, so total x ≈ 1.29128599628 + 0.000000000003855 ≈ 1.291285996283855.So, x ≈ 1.291285996283855.So, the decimal part is approximately 0.291285996283855, which is still less than 0.5, so when rounded to the nearest integer, it's 1.But wait, let me check if my estimation of the tail sum is correct.I said that sum from n=11 to infinity is less than 3.855 x 10^-12. But actually, since 1/n^n decreases faster than 1/11^n, the sum is even smaller.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum from n=11 to n=20 and see how much it contributes.Compute 1/11^11 ≈ 3.504 x 10^-12.1/12^12 ≈ 1.121 x 10^-13.1/13^13 ≈ 3.303 x 10^-15.1/14^14: 14^14 is 14*14=196, 196*14=2744, 2744*14=38416, 38416*14=537824, 537824*14=7529536, 7529536*14=105413504, 105413504*14=1475789056, 1475789056*14=20661046784, 20661046784*14=289254654976, 289254654976*14=4049565169664, 4049565169664*14=56693912375296. So 1/14^14 ≈ 1.763 x 10^-14.Similarly, 1/15^15 is going to be even smaller.So, adding these up:3.504e-12 + 1.121e-13 + 3.303e-15 + 1.763e-14 + ... Let's compute the sum:3.504e-12 ≈ 0.0000000000035041.121e-13 ≈ 0.00000000000011213.303e-15 ≈ 0.0000000000000033031.763e-14 ≈ 0.00000000000001763Adding these:0.000000000003504 + 0.0000000000001121 = 0.0000000000036161+ 0.000000000000003303 = 0.000000000003619403+ 0.00000000000001763 = 0.00000000000363703So, the sum from n=11 to n=14 is approximately 0.00000000000363703.Continuing, the next term, 1/15^15, is going to be even smaller, on the order of 10^-16 or so.So, the total sum from n=11 to n=100 is going to be approximately 0.00000000000363703 plus a tiny bit more, but it's still less than 0.000000000004.So, adding that to our previous total of approximately 1.29128599628, we get:1.29128599628 + 0.00000000000363703 ≈ 1.29128599628363703.So, x ≈ 1.29128599628363703.So, the decimal part is approximately 0.29128599628363703, which is still less than 0.5.Therefore, when rounding to the nearest integer, we look at the decimal part. Since 0.291285... is less than 0.5, we round down.Hence, x rounded to the nearest integer is 1.But wait, let me just confirm once more because sometimes these series can have unexpected behaviors.Wait, another approach: perhaps using known values or known series.I recall that the series sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n^n is known to converge to approximately 1.29128599706266354040728259059560054149861936681325... So, it's approximately 1.291285997.So, x is equal to this sum up to n=100, which is almost the entire series because the terms beyond n=10 are negligible.Therefore, x ≈ 1.291285997, which is approximately 1.291286.So, the integer part is 1, and the decimal is approximately 0.291286, which is less than 0.5, so rounding to the nearest integer gives 1.Therefore, Lisa's number x, when rounded to the nearest integer, is 1.**Final Answer**The value of ( x ) rounded to the nearest integer is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Honor student Polycarp and underachiever Kolka each created the smallest 5-digit number composed of distinct even digits. Polycarp made his number correctly, but Kolka made a mistake. However, it turned out that the difference between Kolka's number and the correct answer was less than 100. What numbers did Polycarp and Kolka form?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Polycarp and Kolka each created the smallest 5-digit number composed of distinct even digits. Polycarp did it correctly, but Kolka made a mistake. However, the difference between Kolka's number and the correct answer was less than 100. I need to figure out what numbers they formed.First, let me understand the problem step by step. The task is to create the smallest 5-digit number using distinct even digits. So, the digits can only be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, and each digit must be unique. Since it's a 5-digit number, the first digit can't be 0 because that would make it a 4-digit number. So, the first digit has to be the smallest possible even digit, which is 2.Now, to make the smallest number possible, we want the digits to be in ascending order as much as possible. So, starting with 2, the next digits should be the smallest available even digits. The digits we can use are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. Since 2 is already used, the next smallest is 0. But wait, can we use 0 in the second position? Yes, because 0 is allowed in other positions except the first one. So, the number would start with 2, then 0.Then, the next digit should be the next smallest available even digit, which is 4. After that, 6, and finally 8. So, putting it all together, the number would be 20468. Let me check if that's the smallest possible. Is there a way to make it smaller? If I try to rearrange the digits, can I get a smaller number?Wait, the first digit is 2, which is the smallest possible. The second digit is 0, which is the next smallest. Then 4, 6, 8. I don't think we can get any smaller than that because any other arrangement would either have a larger digit in an earlier position or repeat a digit, which isn't allowed. So, Polycarp's number is 20468.Now, Kolka made a mistake but his number is also a 5-digit number with distinct even digits, and the difference between his number and Polycarp's number is less than 100. So, Kolka's number is either 20468 plus or minus some number less than 100. But since 20468 is the smallest possible, Kolka's number must be larger than that, right? Because if he made a mistake, he might have used a larger digit somewhere, making the number bigger.Wait, but the problem says Kolka made a mistake, but it doesn't specify whether his number is larger or smaller. However, since 20468 is the smallest possible, Kolka's number can't be smaller because that would require using a digit smaller than 2 in the first position, which isn't allowed. So, Kolka's number must be larger than 20468, but less than 20468 + 100, which is 20568.So, Kolka's number is between 20469 and 20567. But Kolka's number must also be a 5-digit number with distinct even digits. Let me think about what numbers in that range satisfy that condition.First, let's note that the digits in Kolka's number must be distinct even digits, so digits can only be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and all must be unique. Also, the first digit is 2, so the number is in the 20000s.Looking at the range 20469 to 20567, the first three digits are fixed as 204, and the last two digits can vary. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Let's think about how the numbers increase.Starting from 20468, the next number would be 20468 + 1 = 20469, but 20469 has a 9, which is odd, so it's invalid. Similarly, 20470 has a 7, which is odd, so invalid. So, the next possible number with all even digits would be 20480, but wait, 20480 has an 8 and a 0, but let's check the digits: 2, 0, 4, 8, 0. Wait, 0 is repeated, so that's invalid because digits must be distinct.Hmm, so we need to find the next number after 20468 that uses distinct even digits. Let's try to increment the number step by step, checking each time.20468 is the correct number. The next number would be 20468 + 1 = 20469, which is invalid because of the 9. 20470: has a 7, invalid. 20471: 7 and 1, invalid. 20472: 7 and 2, but 2 is already used, so invalid. Wait, 20472: digits are 2,0,4,7,2. 7 is odd, and 2 is repeated. So invalid.20473: 7 and 3, invalid. 20474: 7 and 4, invalid. 20475: 7 and 5, invalid. 20476: 7 and 6, invalid. 20477: 7 is odd and repeated. 20478: 7 and 8, invalid. 20479: 7 and 9, invalid. 20480: digits are 2,0,4,8,0. Repeats 0, invalid. 20481: 8 and 1, invalid. 20482: 8 and 2, but 2 is already used, invalid. 20483: 8 and 3, invalid. 20484: 8 and 4, invalid. 20485: 8 and 5, invalid. 20486: 8 and 6, invalid. 20487: 8 and 7, invalid. 20488: 8 is repeated, invalid. 20489: 8 and 9, invalid. 20490: 9 and 0, invalid. 20491: 9 and 1, invalid. 20492: 9 and 2, invalid. 20493: 9 and 3, invalid. 20494: 9 and 4, invalid. 20495: 9 and 5, invalid. 20496: 9 and 6, invalid. 20497: 9 and 7, invalid. 20498: 9 and 8, invalid. 20499: 9 is repeated, invalid.Okay, this is taking too long. Maybe there's a smarter way. Since the difference is less than 100, Kolka's number is between 20468 and 20568. So, let's look for numbers in that range with distinct even digits.Starting from 20468, the next possible number would be 20486. Wait, 20486: digits are 2,0,4,8,6. Are these all even and distinct? Yes. So, 20486 is a candidate. Let's check the difference: 20486 - 20468 = 18, which is less than 100. So, that's a possibility.But wait, is 20486 the next possible number? Let's see. After 20468, the next number with all even digits would involve changing the last two digits. Since 20468 ends with 68, the next possible even digits after 68 would be 80, but 80 is higher, but we need to check if the digits are distinct.Wait, 20468: last two digits are 6 and 8. To get the next number, we can try to increment the last digit, but 8 is the highest even digit, so we have to carry over. So, incrementing 20468: the last digit is 8, so we can't increment it without changing the previous digit. So, we have to change the fourth digit from 6 to 8, and then set the last digit to 0. But wait, 20480 has a repeated 0, which is invalid. So, that's not allowed.Alternatively, maybe we can rearrange the last two digits. Instead of 68, maybe 86. So, 20486. Let's check the digits: 2,0,4,8,6. All even and distinct. So, 20486 is a valid number. The difference is 18, which is less than 100.Is there another number between 20468 and 20568 that fits? Let's see. Next, after 20486, the next number would be 20486 + 2 = 20488, but that repeats 8, invalid. 20490: has a 9, invalid. 20492: 9 is invalid. 20494: 9 is invalid. 20496: 9 is invalid. 20498: 9 is invalid. 20500: 5 is invalid. 20502: 5 is invalid. 20504: 5 is invalid. 20506: 5 is invalid. 20508: 5 is invalid. 20520: 5 is invalid. 20522: 5 is invalid and repeats 2. 20524: 5 is invalid. 20526: 5 is invalid. 20528: 5 is invalid. 20540: 5 is invalid. 20542: 5 is invalid. 20544: 5 is invalid and repeats 4. 20546: 5 is invalid. 20548: 5 is invalid. 20560: 5 is invalid. 20562: 5 is invalid. 20564: 5 is invalid. 20566: 5 is invalid and repeats 6. 20568: 5 is invalid.Wait, so after 20486, the next possible number would be 20648? But that's outside the 100 difference range. Because 20648 - 20468 = 180, which is more than 100. So, that's too big.Alternatively, maybe there's another number between 20468 and 20568. Let's think about changing the third digit. The third digit in 20468 is 4. If we change it to 6, then the number becomes 206xx. But 206xx is 20600+, which is more than 20568, so the difference would be more than 100. So, that's not possible.What if we change the fourth digit? The fourth digit is 6. If we change it to 8, we get 2048x. Then, the last digit has to be 0, but 20480 has a repeated 0, which is invalid. Alternatively, maybe 20486, which we already considered.Alternatively, what if we rearrange the digits differently? For example, 20468 vs. 20486. That's the only rearrangement that keeps the first three digits as 204 and changes the last two. Any other rearrangement would either repeat a digit or introduce an odd digit.Wait, another thought: maybe Kolka's number is 20468 with a different arrangement of the last two digits. But 20468 is already the smallest, so any rearrangement would make it larger. So, the next possible number is 20486, which is 18 more.Is there another number in that range? Let's see. If we change the third digit from 4 to 0, but that would make the number start with 200, which is smaller, but we already have 20468 as the smallest. So, that's not possible.Alternatively, maybe Kolka used a different digit in the second position. Instead of 0, he used 2, but that would repeat the first digit. So, invalid. Or 4, but that would make the number larger. For example, 24068, but that's 24068, which is 24068 - 20468 = 3600, which is way more than 100. So, that's not possible.Wait, maybe Kolka swapped the third and fourth digits. So, instead of 20468, he did 20648. But 20648 - 20468 = 180, which is more than 100. So, that's outside the range.Alternatively, maybe he changed the last digit from 8 to 0, but that would require changing the fourth digit as well. For example, 20460, but that has a 0 in the last digit and a 6 in the fourth, which is allowed, but 20460 is smaller than 20468, which is impossible because 20468 is the smallest. So, that's not possible.Wait, no, 20460 is smaller than 20468, but since 20468 is the smallest, Kolka's number can't be smaller. So, that's not possible.Another idea: maybe Kolka used a different digit in the fourth position. Instead of 6, he used 8, but then the last digit would have to be 0, but that would repeat 0. So, 20480 is invalid. Alternatively, maybe he used 20486, which we already considered.Wait, is there another number between 20468 and 20568 with distinct even digits? Let's think about 20486, which is 18 more. Then, what about 20648? No, that's too far. 20486 is the only one I can think of.Wait, let me check 20486 again. Digits: 2,0,4,8,6. All even, distinct. Yes. Difference is 18, which is less than 100. So, that's a valid possibility.Is there another number? Let's think about 20468 + 20 = 20488, but that repeats 8. 20468 + 22 = 20490, which has a 9. 20468 + 24 = 20492, which has a 9. 20468 + 26 = 20494, which has a 9. 20468 + 28 = 20496, which has a 9. 20468 + 30 = 20498, which has a 9. 20468 + 32 = 20500, which has a 5. 20468 + 34 = 20502, which has a 5. 20468 + 36 = 20504, which has a 5. 20468 + 38 = 20506, which has a 5. 20468 + 40 = 20508, which has a 5. 20468 + 42 = 20510, which has a 5 and 1. 20468 + 44 = 20512, which has a 5 and 1. 20468 + 46 = 20514, which has a 5 and 1. 20468 + 48 = 20516, which has a 5 and 1. 20468 + 50 = 20518, which has a 5 and 1. 20468 + 52 = 20520, which has a 5. 20468 + 54 = 20522, which has a 5 and repeats 2. 20468 + 56 = 20524, which has a 5. 20468 + 58 = 20526, which has a 5. 20468 + 60 = 20528, which has a 5. 20468 + 62 = 20530, which has a 5 and 3. 20468 + 64 = 20532, which has a 5 and 3. 20468 + 66 = 20534, which has a 5 and 3. 20468 + 68 = 20536, which has a 5 and 3. 20468 + 70 = 20538, which has a 5 and 3. 20468 + 72 = 20540, which has a 5. 20468 + 74 = 20542, which has a 5. 20468 + 76 = 20544, which has a 5 and repeats 4. 20468 + 78 = 20546, which has a 5. 20468 + 80 = 20548, which has a 5. 20468 + 82 = 20550, which has a 5. 20468 + 84 = 20552, which has a 5. 20468 + 86 = 20554, which has a 5. 20468 + 88 = 20556, which has a 5. 20468 + 90 = 20558, which has a 5. 20468 + 92 = 20560, which has a 5. 20468 + 94 = 20562, which has a 5. 20468 + 96 = 20564, which has a 5. 20468 + 98 = 20566, which has a 5 and repeats 6.So, in the entire range from 20468 to 20566, the only number with all even digits and distinct digits is 20486. Therefore, Kolka's number must be 20486.Wait, but let me double-check. Is there another number? For example, 20648 is too far, as we saw. What about 20846? That's 20846 - 20468 = 378, which is more than 100. So, no.Alternatively, maybe Kolka changed the third digit from 4 to 6, making it 20648, but that's too far. Or 20684, which is even larger.Wait, another thought: maybe Kolka didn't change the last two digits but changed one of the middle digits. For example, instead of 20468, he did 20486, which we already considered. Or maybe 20648, but that's too big.Alternatively, maybe he changed the second digit from 0 to 2, but that would repeat the first digit. So, invalid. Or 4, but that would make the number 24xxx, which is larger than 20468 by more than 100.Wait, 24xxx would be 24000+, which is 24000 - 20468 = 3532, way more than 100. So, that's not possible.Alternatively, maybe he changed the third digit from 4 to 0, but that would make the number 20068, which is smaller than 20468, which is impossible because 20468 is the smallest.Wait, 20068 is smaller, but it's invalid because the third digit is 0, which is allowed, but the number would be 20068, which is smaller than 20468. But since 20468 is the smallest, Kolka's number can't be smaller. So, that's not possible.Another idea: maybe Kolka used a different digit in the fourth position, like 8 instead of 6, but then the last digit would have to be 0, but that would repeat 0. So, 20480 is invalid. Alternatively, maybe he used 20486, which is valid.Wait, is there a number like 20468 + 10 = 20478, but that has a 7, which is invalid. 20468 + 20 = 20488, which repeats 8. 20468 + 30 = 20498, which has a 9. 20468 + 40 = 20508, which has a 5. 20468 + 50 = 20518, which has a 5 and 1. 20468 + 60 = 20528, which has a 5. 20468 + 70 = 20538, which has a 5 and 3. 20468 + 80 = 20548, which has a 5. 20468 + 90 = 20558, which has a 5.So, none of these are valid except for 20486.Wait, another approach: let's list all 5-digit numbers with distinct even digits starting with 20, and see which ones are close to 20468.Starting with 204xx, the digits are 2,0,4,x,x. The remaining digits must be 6 and 8, but arranged in ascending order to make the smallest number. So, 20468 is the smallest. The next possible would be 20486, which is 18 more.Alternatively, if we change the third digit from 4 to 6, we get 206xx, but that's 20600+, which is too far.Alternatively, if we change the second digit from 0 to 2, but that repeats the first digit. So, invalid.Alternatively, if we change the second digit to 4, making it 24xxx, which is too far.Alternatively, if we change the third digit to 8, making it 208xx, which is 20800+, which is too far.So, the only possible number in the range is 20486.Therefore, Polycarp's number is 20468, and Kolka's number is 20486.Wait, but let me confirm that 20486 is indeed the only number in that range with distinct even digits. Let's see:- 20468: correct.- 20486: next possible.- 20648: too far.- 20684: too far.- 20846: too far.- 20864: too far.- 24068: too far.- 24086: too far.- 24608: too far.- 24680: too far.- 24806: too far.- 24860: too far.- 26048: too far.- 26084: too far.- 26408: too far.- 26480: too far.- 26804: too far.- 26840: too far.- 28046: too far.- 28064: too far.- 28406: too far.- 28460: too far.- 28604: too far.- 28640: too far.All of these are outside the 100 difference range except for 20486.Therefore, the only possible numbers are 20468 (Polycarp) and 20486 (Kolka).Wait, but let me check if there's another number between 20468 and 20568. For example, 20486 is 20468 + 18. Is there another number like 20486 + 2 = 20488, but that's invalid. 20486 + 4 = 20490, invalid. 20486 + 6 = 20492, invalid. 20486 + 8 = 20494, invalid. 20486 + 10 = 20496, invalid. 20486 + 12 = 20498, invalid. 20486 + 14 = 20500, invalid. 20486 + 16 = 20502, invalid. 20486 + 18 = 20504, invalid. 20486 + 20 = 20506, invalid. 20486 + 22 = 20508, invalid. 20486 + 24 = 20510, invalid. 20486 + 26 = 20512, invalid. 20486 + 28 = 20514, invalid. 20486 + 30 = 20516, invalid. 20486 + 32 = 20518, invalid. 20486 + 34 = 20520, invalid. 20486 + 36 = 20522, invalid. 20486 + 38 = 20524, invalid. 20486 + 40 = 20526, invalid. 20486 + 42 = 20528, invalid. 20486 + 44 = 20530, invalid. 20486 + 46 = 20532, invalid. 20486 + 48 = 20534, invalid. 20486 + 50 = 20536, invalid. 20486 + 52 = 20538, invalid. 20486 + 54 = 20540, invalid. 20486 + 56 = 20542, invalid. 20486 + 58 = 20544, invalid. 20486 + 60 = 20546, invalid. 20486 + 62 = 20548, invalid. 20486 + 64 = 20550, invalid. 20486 + 66 = 20552, invalid. 20486 + 68 = 20554, invalid. 20486 + 70 = 20556, invalid. 20486 + 72 = 20558, invalid. 20486 + 74 = 20560, invalid. 20486 + 76 = 20562, invalid. 20486 + 78 = 20564, invalid. 20486 + 80 = 20566, invalid.So, no other numbers in that range are valid. Therefore, Kolka's number must be 20486.Thus, Polycarp's number is 20468, and Kolka's number is 20486."},{"question":"In a class of 55 students, 43 are sports enthusiasts and 34 are music enthusiasts.

Hmm, natural coordinates, so that means both x and y have to be natural numbers, right? So x and y are positive integers. First, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it correctly:y = (-x²)/3 + 5x + 72I need to find all pairs (x, y) where x and y are natural numbers, and they satisfy this equation. So, for each natural number x, I can plug it into the equation and see if y comes out as a natural number. If it does, then that point is on the parabola with natural coordinates.But since x and y have to be natural numbers, I should figure out for which x values y is also a natural number. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let's consider the equation:y = (-x²)/3 + 5x + 72Since y has to be a natural number, the right-hand side must evaluate to a positive integer. So, (-x²)/3 + 5x + 72 must be an integer. Let me rearrange the equation to make it clearer:y = (-x² + 15x + 216)/3So, y is equal to (-x² + 15x + 216) divided by 3. Therefore, for y to be an integer, the numerator (-x² + 15x + 216) must be divisible by 3. That is, (-x² + 15x + 216) ≡ 0 mod 3.Let me compute this modulo 3 to find the conditions on x.Compute each term modulo 3:- (-x²) mod 3 is equivalent to (-1)*(x² mod 3)- 15x mod 3 is 0 because 15 is divisible by 3- 216 mod 3 is 0 because 216 is divisible by 3So, the entire expression modulo 3 is:(-x²) mod 3 + 0 + 0 ≡ (-x²) mod 3Therefore, for the numerator to be divisible by 3, we need:(-x²) ≡ 0 mod 3Which implies that x² ≡ 0 mod 3.So, x² ≡ 0 mod 3. That means x must be congruent to 0 mod 3, because if a square is 0 mod 3, the original number must be 0 mod 3. So, x must be a multiple of 3.Therefore, x can be written as x = 3k, where k is a natural number. So, let me substitute x = 3k into the equation.Substituting x = 3k into y:y = (- (3k)²)/3 + 5*(3k) + 72Simplify each term:- (9k²)/3 = 3k²- 5*(3k) = 15k- 72 remains as is.So, putting it all together:y = -3k² + 15k + 72Hmm, so now y is expressed in terms of k as y = -3k² + 15k + 72. Since y has to be a natural number, we need y > 0. So, let's find the values of k for which y is positive.So, set up the inequality:-3k² + 15k + 72 > 0Let me solve this quadratic inequality. First, multiply both sides by -1 (remembering to reverse the inequality sign):3k² - 15k - 72 < 0Now, let's solve 3k² - 15k - 72 < 0.First, find the roots of the quadratic equation 3k² - 15k - 72 = 0.Using the quadratic formula:k = [15 ± sqrt(225 + 864)] / 6Wait, discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-15)² - 4*3*(-72) = 225 + 864 = 1089sqrt(1089) = 33So, k = [15 ± 33]/6So, two solutions:k = (15 + 33)/6 = 48/6 = 8k = (15 - 33)/6 = (-18)/6 = -3So, the quadratic 3k² - 15k - 72 factors as 3(k - 8)(k + 3). So, the inequality 3k² - 15k - 72 < 0 is equivalent to (k - 8)(k + 3) < 0.Since 3 is positive, the inequality sign remains the same.So, (k - 8)(k + 3) < 0This product is negative when one factor is positive and the other is negative.Case 1: k - 8 > 0 and k + 3 < 0But k + 3 < 0 implies k < -3, which contradicts k - 8 > 0 (since k > 8). So, no solution here.Case 2: k - 8 < 0 and k + 3 > 0So, k < 8 and k > -3.But since k is a natural number (since x is natural, and x = 3k, so k must be at least 1), so k must satisfy 1 ≤ k < 8.Therefore, k can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.So, k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}Therefore, x = 3k can be 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21.Now, let me compute y for each of these x values and check if y is a natural number.Wait, but since we already substituted x = 3k and expressed y in terms of k, and since k is an integer, y is automatically an integer because y = -3k² + 15k + 72, which is an integer as long as k is integer.But we also need y to be positive. So, let's compute y for each k from 1 to 7.Let me make a table:k | x = 3k | y = -3k² +15k +72---|------|---1 | 3 | -3(1) +15(1) +72 = -3 +15 +72 = 842 | 6 | -3(4) +15(2) +72 = -12 +30 +72 = 903 | 9 | -3(9) +15(3) +72 = -27 +45 +72 = 904 | 12 | -3(16) +15(4) +72 = -48 +60 +72 = 845 | 15 | -3(25) +15(5) +72 = -75 +75 +72 = 726 | 18 | -3(36) +15(6) +72 = -108 +90 +72 = 547 | 21 | -3(49) +15(7) +72 = -147 +105 +72 = 30Wait, so for each k from 1 to 7, y is positive. So, all these k values give natural numbers for y.But let me check for k=8: x=24, y = -3(64) +15(8) +72 = -192 +120 +72 = 0. But y=0 is not a natural number, so k=8 is excluded, which is consistent with our earlier inequality.Similarly, for k=0, x=0, but x has to be natural, so x=0 is excluded.So, we have k=1 to k=7, each giving a natural number y.Therefore, the points are:(3,84), (6,90), (9,90), (12,84), (15,72), (18,54), (21,30)So, that's 7 points.Wait, but let me double-check each y value to make sure they are positive integers.For k=1: y=84, which is natural.k=2: y=90, natural.k=3: y=90, natural.k=4: y=84, natural.k=5: y=72, natural.k=6: y=54, natural.k=7: y=30, natural.Yes, all of these are positive integers.Therefore, there are 7 such points.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me check if x can be larger than 21. For example, what happens when k=8, x=24, y=0, which is not natural. k=9, x=27, y would be y = -3(81) +15(9) +72 = -243 +135 +72 = -36, which is negative, so y is not natural.Similarly, for k=0, x=0, y=72, but x=0 is not natural.So, indeed, only k=1 through 7 give natural y.Therefore, the number of points is 7.Wait, but let me also check for x values that are not multiples of 3. Because earlier, I concluded that x must be a multiple of 3 for y to be integer. But is that necessarily the case?Wait, let me think again. The numerator (-x² +15x +216) must be divisible by 3. So, (-x² +15x +216) ≡ 0 mod 3.Which simplifies to (-x²) ≡ 0 mod 3, since 15x ≡ 0 mod 3 and 216 ≡ 0 mod 3.So, -x² ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ x² ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ x ≡ 0 mod 3.Therefore, x must be a multiple of 3. So, only x=3k, where k is natural, will give integer y. So, my initial conclusion was correct. Therefore, only x=3,6,9,12,15,18,21 give natural y.Therefore, there are 7 such points.Wait, but let me check x=0: y=72, but x=0 is not natural, so it's excluded.Similarly, x=1: y = -1/3 +5 +72 = (-1/3) +77 = 76.333..., which is not natural.x=2: y = -4/3 +10 +72 = (-4/3) +82 = 80.666..., not natural.x=3: y=84, natural.x=4: y = -16/3 +20 +72 = (-5.333...) +92 = 86.666..., not natural.x=5: y = -25/3 +25 +72 = (-8.333...) +97 = 88.666..., not natural.x=6: y=90, natural.x=7: y = -49/3 +35 +72 = (-16.333...) +107 = 90.666..., not natural.x=8: y = -64/3 +40 +72 = (-21.333...) +112 = 90.666..., not natural.x=9: y=90, natural.x=10: y = -100/3 +50 +72 = (-33.333...) +122 = 88.666..., not natural.x=11: y = -121/3 +55 +72 = (-40.333...) +127 = 86.666..., not natural.x=12: y=84, natural.x=13: y = -169/3 +65 +72 = (-56.333...) +137 = 80.666..., not natural.x=14: y = -196/3 +70 +72 = (-65.333...) +142 = 76.666..., not natural.x=15: y=72, natural.x=16: y = -256/3 +80 +72 = (-85.333...) +152 = 66.666..., not natural.x=17: y = -289/3 +85 +72 = (-96.333...) +157 = 60.666..., not natural.x=18: y=54, natural.x=19: y = -361/3 +95 +72 = (-120.333...) +167 = 46.666..., not natural.x=20: y = -400/3 +100 +72 = (-133.333...) +172 = 38.666..., not natural.x=21: y=30, natural.x=22: y = -484/3 +110 +72 = (-161.333...) +182 = 20.666..., not natural.x=23: y = -529/3 +115 +72 = (-176.333...) +187 = 10.666..., not natural.x=24: y=0, not natural.x=25: y negative, not natural.So, indeed, only x=3,6,9,12,15,18,21 give natural y.

Let me write down these equations using the formula.First, a₁ is just a₁. Then, a₂ is a₁ + d. So, a₁ + a₂ would be a₁ + (a₁ + d) = 2a₁ + d. And that's equal to -1. So, my first equation is:2a₁ + d = -1.Second, a₃ is given as 4. Using the formula, a₃ = a₁ + 2d. So, that gives me the second equation:a₁ + 2d = 4.Now, I have a system of two equations with two variables, a₁ and d. Let me write them again:1) 2a₁ + d = -12) a₁ + 2d = 4I need to solve this system. I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here. Let me try to eliminate one of the variables.If I multiply the first equation by 2, it'll become:2*(2a₁ + d) = 2*(-1) => 4a₁ + 2d = -2.Now, my two equations are:1) 4a₁ + 2d = -22) a₁ + 2d = 4Hmm, if I subtract the second equation from the first, the 2d terms will cancel out. Let's do that:(4a₁ + 2d) - (a₁ + 2d) = -2 - 4Simplify the left side: 4a₁ - a₁ + 2d - 2d = 3a₁Right side: -6So, 3a₁ = -6 => a₁ = -2.Okay, so the first term is -2. Now, let's plug this back into one of the original equations to find d. Let's use the second equation:a₁ + 2d = 4 => (-2) + 2d = 4Add 2 to both sides: 2d = 6 => d = 3.So, the common difference is 3. Now, let me write out the first few terms to make sure I didn't make a mistake.a₁ = -2a₂ = a₁ + d = -2 + 3 = 1a₃ = a₂ + d = 1 + 3 = 4Okay, that matches the given information: a₁ + a₂ = -2 + 1 = -1, which is correct, and a₃ = 4, which is also correct. So, my a₁ and d are correct.Now, the problem asks for the sum of a₄ + a₅. Let me find each term.a₄ = a₁ + 3d = -2 + 3*3 = -2 + 9 = 7a₅ = a₁ + 4d = -2 + 4*3 = -2 + 12 = 10So, a₄ + a₅ = 7 + 10 = 17.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.a₄: -2 + 3*3 = -2 + 9 = 7. That's correct.a₅: -2 + 4*3 = -2 + 12 = 10. That's also correct.Adding them together: 7 + 10 = 17. Yep, that seems right.Alternatively, since it's an arithmetic sequence, the sum of two terms can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence. But since we're only adding two terms, it's just as easy to compute each term individually.Alternatively, another approach: since a₄ and a₅ are consecutive terms, their average is equal to the average of a₄ and a₅, which is also equal to the middle term if they were consecutive. But since they are consecutive, the average is just the term in the middle, but since there are two terms, it's just the average of a₄ and a₅. But I don't know if that helps here.Alternatively, maybe I can express a₄ + a₅ in terms of a₁ and d.a₄ = a₁ + 3da₅ = a₁ + 4dSo, a₄ + a₅ = 2a₁ + 7dWe already know a₁ = -2 and d = 3, so plug those in:2*(-2) + 7*3 = -4 + 21 = 17.Same result. So, that's a good check.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in an arithmetic sequence, the sum of terms equidistant from the ends is constant. But in this case, since we're dealing with a₄ and a₅, which are not symmetric around any particular term, that might not help.Alternatively, maybe I can find the sum of the first five terms and subtract the sum of the first three terms. Let's see:Sum of first n terms is given by S_n = n/2*(2a₁ + (n-1)d)So, S₅ = 5/2*(2*(-2) + 4*3) = 5/2*(-4 + 12) = 5/2*(8) = 5*4 = 20S₃ = 3/2*(2*(-2) + 2*3) = 3/2*(-4 + 6) = 3/2*(2) = 3So, S₅ - S₃ = 20 - 3 = 17, which is the sum of a₄ + a₅. That's another way to get the same answer.So, regardless of the method, I get 17. That gives me more confidence that 17 is the correct answer.Wait, just to make sure, let me write out all the terms up to a₅:a₁ = -2a₂ = 1a₃ = 4a₄ = 7a₅ = 10So, a₄ + a₅ = 7 + 10 = 17. Yep, that's consistent.I think that's solid. So, the answer is 17.**Final Answer**The sum of (a_4 + a_5) is boxed{17}."},{"question":"Find the coefficient of frac{1}{x^{2}} in the expansion of the binomial ( sqrt {x}+ frac {2}{x})^{5}.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of 1/x² in the expansion of (sqrt(x) + 2/x)^5. Hmm, binomial expansions. I remember that the binomial theorem allows us to expand expressions like (a + b)^n. The general term is something like C(n, k) * a^(n - k) * b^k, right?Let me write that down. The binomial expansion of (a + b)^n is the sum from k=0 to n of C(n, k) * a^(n - k) * b^k. So in this case, a is sqrt(x), b is 2/x, and n is 5.So each term in the expansion will be C(5, k) * (sqrt(x))^(5 - k) * (2/x)^k. I need to find the term where the exponent of x is -2 because 1/x² is x^(-2). So I need to find the value of k such that the exponent of x in that term is -2.Let me figure out the exponent of x in each term. The term is (sqrt(x))^(5 - k) * (2/x)^k. Let's break that down. sqrt(x) is x^(1/2), so (sqrt(x))^(5 - k) is x^((5 - k)/2). Then, (2/x)^k is 2^k * x^(-k). So when we multiply those together, the exponent of x is (5 - k)/2 - k.Let me write that as an equation:(5 - k)/2 - k = exponent of x.We need this exponent to be equal to -2 because we're looking for the term with 1/x².So:(5 - k)/2 - k = -2Let me solve for k.First, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:5 - k - 2k = -4Combine like terms:5 - 3k = -4Subtract 5 from both sides:-3k = -9Divide both sides by -3:k = 3Okay, so when k is 3, the exponent of x is -2. That means the term where k=3 is the one with x^(-2), which is 1/x².Now, let's find the coefficient of that term. The general term is C(5, k) * (sqrt(x))^(5 - k) * (2/x)^k. So plugging in k=3:C(5, 3) * (sqrt(x))^(5 - 3) * (2/x)^3Simplify each part:C(5, 3) is the combination of 5 things taken 3 at a time. I remember that C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!2!) = (120) / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = 10.Then, (sqrt(x))^(2) is x^(1), because sqrt(x) squared is x.And (2/x)^3 is 8 / x³, because 2 cubed is 8 and x cubed is x³.So putting it all together:10 * x * (8 / x³) = 10 * 8 * x / x³Simplify x / x³: that's x^(-2), which is 1/x².So 10 * 8 = 80, so the term is 80 / x².Therefore, the coefficient is 80.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, binomial theorem: correct. Each term is C(5, k) * (sqrt(x))^(5 - k) * (2/x)^k. Correct.Exponent calculation: (5 - k)/2 - k. Let me verify with k=3: (5 - 3)/2 - 3 = 2/2 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2. Correct.Coefficient calculation: C(5, 3) is 10. (sqrt(x))^(2) is x. (2/x)^3 is 8/x³. Multiplying together: 10 * x * 8 / x³ = 80 / x². So yes, the coefficient is 80.Wait, but let me think again. When I multiply x * 8 / x³, that's 8x / x³, which is 8 / x². Then multiplied by 10 is 80 / x². Yeah, that's correct.So I think I did it right. The coefficient is 80.**Final Answer**The coefficient of frac{1}{x^{2}} is boxed{80}."},{"question":"Given the sequence  (u_n)  satisfying:   left{ begin{array}{l}1 le {u_1} le 3{u_{n + 1}} = 4 - dfrac{{2({u_n} + 1)}}{{{2^{{u_n}}}}},forall n in mathbb{Z^+}.end{array} right.   Prove that:  1le u_nle 3,forall nin mathbb{Z^+}  and find the limit of  (u_n). ","answer":"Alright, so I have this sequence defined by ( u_1 ) between 1 and 3, and then each subsequent term is given by ( u_{n+1} = 4 - frac{2(u_n + 1)}{2^{u_n}} ). I need to prove that for all positive integers ( n ), ( 1 leq u_n leq 3 ), and then find the limit of the sequence if it exists.First, let me understand the problem. The initial term is between 1 and 3, inclusive. Then, each term is defined using the previous one in this somewhat complicated formula. I need to show that no matter what ( u_1 ) is (as long as it's between 1 and 3), all the terms stay within that interval. Then, assuming the sequence converges, I need to find its limit.Okay, so maybe I can approach this by induction. That is, assume that ( u_n ) is between 1 and 3, and then show that ( u_{n+1} ) is also between 1 and 3. That should work for the first part.Let me write down what I need to show:1. Base case: ( n = 1 ). Given ( 1 leq u_1 leq 3 ), so it holds.2. Inductive step: Assume ( 1 leq u_k leq 3 ) for some ( k geq 1 ). Then, show that ( 1 leq u_{k+1} leq 3 ).So, I need to analyze the function ( f(x) = 4 - frac{2(x + 1)}{2^x} ) and show that if ( x ) is between 1 and 3, then ( f(x) ) is also between 1 and 3.Therefore, I need to find the range of ( f(x) ) when ( x in [1, 3] ). If I can show that ( f([1, 3]) subseteq [1, 3] ), then the inductive step is complete.So, let's analyze ( f(x) = 4 - frac{2(x + 1)}{2^x} ).First, let's see what happens at the endpoints of the interval [1, 3].Compute ( f(1) ):( f(1) = 4 - frac{2(1 + 1)}{2^1} = 4 - frac{4}{2} = 4 - 2 = 2 ).Compute ( f(3) ):( f(3) = 4 - frac{2(3 + 1)}{2^3} = 4 - frac{8}{8} = 4 - 1 = 3 ).So, at x=1, f(x)=2, and at x=3, f(x)=3.Now, I need to check the behavior of f(x) in between. Let's see if it's increasing or decreasing.Compute the derivative of f(x) to check its monotonicity.( f(x) = 4 - 2 cdot frac{x + 1}{2^x} ).Let me rewrite ( frac{x + 1}{2^x} ) as ( (x + 1) cdot 2^{-x} ).So, ( f(x) = 4 - 2(x + 1)2^{-x} ).Compute f'(x):First, derivative of 4 is 0.Then, derivative of ( -2(x + 1)2^{-x} ):Use the product rule: derivative of the first times the second plus the first times derivative of the second.Let me denote ( u = (x + 1) ) and ( v = 2^{-x} ).Then, ( u' = 1 ) and ( v' = ln(2) cdot (-1) cdot 2^{-x} ).So, the derivative is:( -2 [ u'v + u v' ] = -2 [ 1 cdot 2^{-x} + (x + 1)(- ln 2) 2^{-x} ] )Simplify:( -2 [ 2^{-x} - (x + 1)ln 2 cdot 2^{-x} ] = -2 cdot 2^{-x} [1 - (x + 1)ln 2] )Factor out:( -2 cdot 2^{-x} [1 - (x + 1)ln 2] )So, f'(x) = ( -2 cdot 2^{-x} [1 - (x + 1)ln 2] )Now, let's analyze the sign of f'(x).First, note that ( 2^{-x} ) is always positive, so the sign of f'(x) depends on the bracket term [1 - (x + 1) ln 2].Compute 1 - (x + 1) ln 2.We can compute ln 2 ≈ 0.6931.So, 1 - (x + 1)(0.6931).Let me find when this is positive or negative.Set 1 - (x + 1) ln 2 = 0.Solve for x:1 = (x + 1) ln 2x + 1 = 1 / ln 2 ≈ 1 / 0.6931 ≈ 1.4427So, x ≈ 1.4427 - 1 ≈ 0.4427.So, when x < 0.4427, 1 - (x + 1) ln 2 > 0.When x > 0.4427, 1 - (x + 1) ln 2 < 0.But in our case, x is in [1, 3], so x is greater than 1, which is greater than 0.4427.Therefore, in [1, 3], 1 - (x + 1) ln 2 is negative.Therefore, the bracket term is negative, and multiplied by -2 * 2^{-x}, which is negative (since 2^{-x} is positive, and -2 is negative). So, negative times negative is positive.Therefore, f'(x) is positive in [1, 3]. So, f(x) is increasing on [1, 3].Wait, that's interesting. So, f(x) is increasing on [1, 3]. Therefore, since f(1) = 2 and f(3) = 3, and it's increasing, then for x in [1, 3], f(x) is in [2, 3].Wait, but that's only for x in [1, 3]. So, if u_n is in [1, 3], then u_{n+1} = f(u_n) is in [2, 3], which is a subset of [1, 3]. So, that would mean that starting from u_1 in [1, 3], u_2 is in [2, 3], and then u_3 is in [f(2), f(3)] = [f(2), 3]. Wait, but f(2) is 4 - 2*(3)/4 = 4 - 6/4 = 4 - 1.5 = 2.5. So, f(2) = 2.5.So, f([2, 3]) is [2.5, 3], since f is increasing.Similarly, f([2.5, 3]) would be [f(2.5), f(3)] = [f(2.5), 3]. Let's compute f(2.5):f(2.5) = 4 - 2*(3.5)/2^{2.5} = 4 - 7 / (2^{2.5}) = 4 - 7 / (sqrt(2^5)) = 4 - 7 / (sqrt(32)) = 4 - 7 / (4 * sqrt(2)) ≈ 4 - 7 / 5.6568 ≈ 4 - 1.237 ≈ 2.763.So, f(2.5) ≈ 2.763, so f([2.5, 3]) ≈ [2.763, 3].So, each time, the interval is getting tighter towards 3.Wait, but in the first step, u_1 is in [1, 3], u_2 is in [2, 3], u_3 is in [2.5, 3], u_4 is in [2.763, 3], and so on, each time getting closer to 3.But wait, the first term u_1 is in [1, 3], but u_2 is in [2, 3], which is a subset. So, actually, all subsequent terms are in [2, 3], right? Because u_2 is at least 2, and since f is increasing, u_3 will be at least f(2) = 2.5, and so on.Wait, but the problem says to prove that 1 ≤ u_n ≤ 3 for all n. So, if u_2 is already in [2, 3], which is within [1, 3], so that's fine. So, inductively, if u_n is in [1, 3], then u_{n+1} is in [2, 3], which is within [1, 3]. So, the sequence remains in [1, 3] for all n.But wait, actually, if u_n is in [2, 3], then u_{n+1} is in [f(2), f(3)] = [2.5, 3], which is still within [2, 3]. So, the sequence is actually converging to 3? Or is it?Wait, hold on. Let me compute f(3) = 3, as we saw earlier. So, if u_n = 3, then u_{n+1} = 3. So, 3 is a fixed point.Similarly, let's see if there are other fixed points. Let me solve f(x) = x.So, 4 - 2(x + 1)/2^x = x.So, 4 - x = 2(x + 1)/2^x.Multiply both sides by 2^x:(4 - x) 2^x = 2(x + 1).Let me rearrange:(4 - x) 2^x - 2(x + 1) = 0.This seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can test x=2:Left side: (4 - 2)2^2 - 2(3) = 2*4 - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2 ≠ 0.x=3:(4 - 3)2^3 - 2(4) = 1*8 - 8 = 0. So, x=3 is a solution.x=1:(4 - 1)2^1 - 2(2) = 3*2 - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2 ≠ 0.x=4:(4 - 4)2^4 - 2(5) = 0 - 10 = -10 ≠ 0.So, x=3 is a fixed point.Is there another fixed point?Let me check x=2:As above, f(2)=2.5, which is not equal to 2.x=2.5:f(2.5) ≈ 2.763, which is not equal to 2.5.x=2.763:Compute f(2.763):First, 2^{2.763} ≈ 2^{2 + 0.763} ≈ 4 * 2^{0.763}.Compute 2^{0.763}: ln(2^{0.763}) = 0.763 * ln 2 ≈ 0.763 * 0.6931 ≈ 0.530.So, e^{0.530} ≈ 1.700.Therefore, 2^{2.763} ≈ 4 * 1.700 ≈ 6.800.Then, 2*(2.763 + 1)/6.800 ≈ 2*3.763 /6.800 ≈ 7.526 /6.800 ≈ 1.106.Therefore, f(2.763) ≈ 4 - 1.106 ≈ 2.894.So, f(2.763) ≈ 2.894, which is greater than 2.763, so it's moving towards 3.Similarly, let's compute f(2.894):2^{2.894} ≈ 2^{2 + 0.894} ≈ 4 * 2^{0.894}.Compute 2^{0.894}: ln(2^{0.894}) ≈ 0.894 * 0.6931 ≈ 0.619.e^{0.619} ≈ 1.856.So, 2^{2.894} ≈ 4 * 1.856 ≈ 7.424.Then, 2*(2.894 + 1)/7.424 ≈ 2*3.894 /7.424 ≈ 7.788 /7.424 ≈ 1.05.Therefore, f(2.894) ≈ 4 - 1.05 ≈ 2.95.So, it's getting closer to 3.Similarly, f(2.95):2^{2.95} ≈ 2^{2 + 0.95} ≈ 4 * 2^{0.95}.Compute 2^{0.95}: ln(2^{0.95}) ≈ 0.95 * 0.6931 ≈ 0.658.e^{0.658} ≈ 1.930.So, 2^{2.95} ≈ 4 * 1.930 ≈ 7.720.Then, 2*(2.95 + 1)/7.720 ≈ 2*3.95 /7.720 ≈ 7.9 /7.720 ≈ 1.023.Therefore, f(2.95) ≈ 4 - 1.023 ≈ 2.977.So, it's approaching 3.Therefore, it seems like the sequence is converging to 3.But wait, is 3 the only fixed point?We saw that f(3) = 3, and when we tried x=2, f(2)=2.5, which is not a fixed point. Similarly, x=1 gives f(1)=2, which is not a fixed point.So, 3 is the only fixed point in [1, 3]. Therefore, if the sequence converges, it must converge to 3.But before that, I need to make sure that the sequence is convergent.Given that the sequence is bounded (between 1 and 3) and monotonic? Wait, is it monotonic?Wait, let's see. Starting from u_1 in [1, 3], u_2 is in [2, 3]. Then, u_3 is in [2.5, 3], and so on. So, each term is increasing, right?Wait, if u_n is in [a, b], then u_{n+1} is in [f(a), f(b)]. Since f is increasing, and f(a) > a if a < 3.Wait, let's see:If u_n is in [a, b], then u_{n+1} = f(u_n) is in [f(a), f(b)].Given that f is increasing, and f(x) > x for x in [1, 3)?Wait, let's check:At x=1: f(1)=2 >1.At x=2: f(2)=2.5 >2.At x=3: f(3)=3.So, for x in [1, 3), f(x) > x, and at x=3, f(x)=x.Therefore, if u_n is in [1, 3), then u_{n+1} = f(u_n) > u_n.So, the sequence is strictly increasing as long as u_n < 3.But since u_n is bounded above by 3, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the sequence converges.Therefore, the limit L must satisfy L = f(L).We already saw that the only fixed point in [1, 3] is 3, so the limit is 3.Wait, but let me verify that.Suppose the limit is L, then L = 4 - 2(L + 1)/2^L.So, 4 - L = 2(L + 1)/2^L.Multiply both sides by 2^L:(4 - L)2^L = 2(L + 1).We need to solve for L.We know that L=3 is a solution:(4 - 3)2^3 = 1*8 = 8.2(3 + 1) = 8.So, 8=8, which holds.Is there another solution?Let me check L=2:(4 - 2)2^2 = 2*4=8.2(2 + 1)=6.8≠6, so no.L=4:(4 - 4)2^4=0.2(4 +1)=10.0≠10.L=1:(4 -1)2^1=3*2=6.2(1 +1)=4.6≠4.So, only L=3 is the solution.Therefore, the limit is 3.So, putting it all together:1. By induction, we can show that 1 ≤ u_n ≤ 3 for all n.2. The sequence is increasing and bounded above by 3, so it converges.3. The limit satisfies L=3.Therefore, the limit is 3.But wait, let me make sure about the induction step.Base case: n=1, 1 ≤ u_1 ≤3, given.Assume for some k ≥1, 1 ≤ u_k ≤3.Then, u_{k+1}=f(u_k).Since f is increasing and f([1,3])=[2,3], which is within [1,3], so 1 ≤ u_{k+1} ≤3.Hence, by induction, 1 ≤ u_n ≤3 for all n.Additionally, since u_{n+1}=f(u_n) ≥ f(1)=2 >1, so actually, u_n is in [2,3] for n ≥2.But regardless, the induction holds.Moreover, since u_{n+1}=f(u_n) > u_n for u_n <3, the sequence is strictly increasing.Since it's bounded above by 3, it converges to 3.Therefore, the limit is 3.**Final Answer**The limit of the sequence is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Given points ( A(-7,0) ), ( B(7,0) ), and ( C(2,-12) ), with ( C ) being a focal point of an ellipse that passes through points ( A ) and ( B ), the trajectory of the other focus of this ellipse is ( ).A. HyperbolaB. EllipseC. Part of an EllipseD. Part of a Hyperbola","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given three points: A(-7,0), B(7,0), and C(2,-12). It says that C is a focal point of an ellipse that passes through points A and B. I need to find the trajectory of the other focus of this ellipse. The options are Hyperbola, Ellipse, Part of an Ellipse, or Part of a Hyperbola.Hmm, let me recall what I know about ellipses. An ellipse is defined as the set of points where the sum of the distances from two fixed points (the foci) is constant. So, if I have one focus at C(2,-12), and the ellipse passes through A and B, then the sum of the distances from A to C and from A to the other focus should be equal to the major axis length, right? Similarly for point B.Wait, so if I denote the other focus as F(x,y), then for point A(-7,0), the sum of the distances AC + AF should be equal to 2a, where a is the semi-major axis. Similarly, for point B(7,0), the sum BC + BF should also be equal to 2a.So, let me write that down:For point A:Distance from A to C: sqrt[(-7 - 2)^2 + (0 - (-12))^2] = sqrt[(-9)^2 + (12)^2] = sqrt[81 + 144] = sqrt[225] = 15.Distance from A to F: sqrt[(-7 - x)^2 + (0 - y)^2] = sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2].So, the sum is 15 + sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] = 2a.Similarly, for point B:Distance from B to C: sqrt[(7 - 2)^2 + (0 - (-12))^2] = sqrt[(5)^2 + (12)^2] = sqrt[25 + 144] = sqrt[169] = 13.Distance from B to F: sqrt[(7 - x)^2 + (0 - y)^2] = sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2].So, the sum is 13 + sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] = 2a.Since both sums equal 2a, I can set them equal to each other:15 + sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] = 13 + sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2].Let me subtract 13 from both sides:2 + sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] = sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2].Now, let me isolate the square roots:sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] - sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] = 2.Hmm, this looks like the definition of a hyperbola. Because a hyperbola is the set of points where the difference of the distances to two foci is constant. So, in this case, the difference is 2, which is a constant.Wait, but let me make sure. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots.Let me denote:Let’s let’s call sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] = D1 and sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] = D2.So, D1 - D2 = 2.Squaring both sides:(D1 - D2)^2 = 4.Which is D1^2 - 2D1D2 + D2^2 = 4.But D1^2 = (x - 7)^2 + y^2 and D2^2 = (x + 7)^2 + y^2.So, substituting:[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] - 2D1D2 + [(x + 7)^2 + y^2] = 4.Simplify the left side:(x^2 - 14x + 49) + y^2 - 2D1D2 + (x^2 + 14x + 49) + y^2 = 4.Combine like terms:2x^2 + 98 + 2y^2 - 2D1D2 = 4.Simplify:2x^2 + 2y^2 + 98 - 2D1D2 = 4.Subtract 4:2x^2 + 2y^2 + 94 - 2D1D2 = 0.Divide both sides by 2:x^2 + y^2 + 47 - D1D2 = 0.So, D1D2 = x^2 + y^2 + 47.But D1D2 is sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] * sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2].Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I should square both sides again?Wait, let me think. Maybe instead of squaring both sides, I can rearrange the equation before squaring.Starting again:sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] - sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] = 2.Let me move one square root to the other side:sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] = 2 + sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2].Now, square both sides:[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] = 4 + 4sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] + [(x + 7)^2 + y^2].Simplify the left and right sides:Left: (x^2 - 14x + 49) + y^2.Right: 4 + 4sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] + (x^2 + 14x + 49) + y^2.So, subtract left side from both sides:0 = 4 + 4sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] + (x^2 + 14x + 49) + y^2 - (x^2 - 14x + 49) - y^2.Simplify:0 = 4 + 4sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] + x^2 + 14x + 49 + y^2 - x^2 + 14x - 49 - y^2.Simplify term by term:x^2 - x^2 = 0.y^2 - y^2 = 0.14x + 14x = 28x.49 - 49 = 0.So, we have:0 = 4 + 4sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] + 28x.Bring constants to the other side:-4 - 28x = 4sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2].Divide both sides by 4:-1 - 7x = sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2].Now, square both sides again:(-1 - 7x)^2 = [(x + 7)^2 + y^2].Expand the left side:(1 + 14x + 49x^2) = (x^2 + 14x + 49) + y^2.Simplify:1 + 14x + 49x^2 = x^2 + 14x + 49 + y^2.Subtract x^2 + 14x + 49 from both sides:1 + 14x + 49x^2 - x^2 - 14x - 49 = y^2.Simplify:(49x^2 - x^2) + (14x -14x) + (1 -49) = y^2.So:48x^2 - 48 = y^2.Divide both sides by 48:x^2 - 1 = (y^2)/48.Rewrite:x^2 - (y^2)/48 = 1.This is the equation of a hyperbola. Specifically, it's a hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis.So, the trajectory of the other focus is a hyperbola.But wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes when squaring both sides, extraneous solutions can be introduced.Looking back, after squaring the first time, I got to:x^2 + y^2 + 47 - D1D2 = 0.Then I squared again and ended up with a hyperbola. So, the conclusion is that the other focus lies on a hyperbola.But the options are Hyperbola, Ellipse, Part of an Ellipse, or Part of a Hyperbola.So, is it a full hyperbola or just a part?Well, in the original equation, sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] - sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] = 2.The left side is the difference of distances from (x,y) to (7,0) and (-7,0). For a hyperbola, the difference is constant, but the absolute value is considered. However, in our case, the difference is positive 2, which would correspond to one branch of the hyperbola.Therefore, the other focus can only lie on one branch of the hyperbola, not the entire hyperbola.Hence, the trajectory is part of a hyperbola.So, the answer should be D. Part of a Hyperbola.Wait, but let me think again. When I squared both sides, I might have introduced solutions where the original equation didn't hold. So, does the hyperbola equation x^2 - (y^2)/48 = 1 include points that satisfy the original condition?In the original equation, sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] - sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] = 2.This implies that sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] > sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2], meaning that the distance to (7,0) is greater than the distance to (-7,0). So, the point (x,y) must lie closer to (-7,0) than to (7,0). Therefore, the hyperbola we found is only the right branch, because the right branch is closer to (-7,0) in terms of the difference.Wait, actually, no. Wait, if the difference is positive, sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] - sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2] = 2, that would mean that sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] is greater, so the point (x,y) is closer to (-7,0) than to (7,0). So, the hyperbola would have two branches, but only the branch where points are closer to (-7,0) would satisfy the equation. So, in this case, the hyperbola x^2 - (y^2)/48 = 1 has two branches, but only the left branch satisfies the condition that distance to (7,0) is greater than distance to (-7,0). Wait, actually, no. Let me think.If the difference is positive, meaning sqrt[(x - 7)^2 + y^2] > sqrt[(x + 7)^2 + y^2], then (x,y) is closer to (-7,0) because the distance to (7,0) is larger. So, the points (x,y) lie closer to (-7,0), which would be on the left side of the hyperbola.But the hyperbola x^2 - (y^2)/48 = 1 opens to the left and right. The left branch would be where x is negative, and the right branch where x is positive.So, if the points are closer to (-7,0), which is on the left, then the other focus must lie on the left branch of the hyperbola.Therefore, the trajectory is only part of the hyperbola, specifically the left branch.Hence, the answer is D. Part of a Hyperbola.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Let m and n be the two roots of the quadratic equation x^{2}+2x-7=0. Then, the value of m^{2}+3m+n is __________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation: ( x^2 + 2x - 7 = 0 ). The roots are ( m ) and ( n ). I need to find the value of ( m^2 + 3m + n ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sum of the roots ( m + n ) is equal to ( -b/a ) and the product ( mn ) is ( c/a ). So, in this case, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = -7 ). Therefore, the sum of the roots ( m + n = -2/1 = -2 ), and the product ( mn = -7/1 = -7 ). Got that down.Now, I need to compute ( m^2 + 3m + n ). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can express ( m^2 ) in terms of the equation itself? Since ( m ) is a root of the equation, it must satisfy ( m^2 + 2m - 7 = 0 ). So, if I rearrange that, I get ( m^2 = -2m + 7 ). That's useful!So, substituting ( m^2 ) into the expression we need to find, we have:( m^2 + 3m + n = (-2m + 7) + 3m + n )Let me simplify that:First, combine like terms:-2m + 3m = mSo, the expression becomes:( m + 7 + n )Which is the same as:( (m + n) + 7 )Oh, wait! Earlier, I found that ( m + n = -2 ). So substituting that in:( (-2) + 7 = 5 )So, the value of ( m^2 + 3m + n ) is 5.But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to mix up signs or coefficients.Starting again:1. Quadratic equation: ( x^2 + 2x - 7 = 0 )2. Roots: ( m ) and ( n )3. Sum of roots: ( m + n = -2 )4. Product of roots: ( mn = -7 )5. Expression to find: ( m^2 + 3m + n )6. Since ( m ) is a root, ( m^2 + 2m - 7 = 0 ) => ( m^2 = -2m + 7 )7. Substitute into expression: ( (-2m + 7) + 3m + n )8. Combine like terms: (-2m + 3m) = m; so ( m + 7 + n )9. Which is ( (m + n) + 7 = (-2) + 7 = 5 )Looks correct. So, yeah, the answer should be 5.Alternatively, just to be thorough, maybe I can compute ( m^2 + 3m + n ) directly by finding the roots and plugging them in. Let's see.First, find the roots using quadratic formula:( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), ( c = -7 ).Discriminant: ( b^2 - 4ac = 4 - 4(1)(-7) = 4 + 28 = 32 )So, roots are:( x = frac{-2 pm sqrt{32}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 4sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 pm 2sqrt{2} )So, the roots are ( m = -1 + 2sqrt{2} ) and ( n = -1 - 2sqrt{2} ), or vice versa.Let me compute ( m^2 + 3m + n ) with ( m = -1 + 2sqrt{2} ) and ( n = -1 - 2sqrt{2} ).First, compute ( m^2 ):( m = -1 + 2sqrt{2} )( m^2 = (-1 + 2sqrt{2})^2 = (-1)^2 + 2*(-1)*(2sqrt{2}) + (2sqrt{2})^2 = 1 - 4sqrt{2} + 8 = 9 - 4sqrt{2} )Then, compute ( 3m ):( 3m = 3*(-1 + 2sqrt{2}) = -3 + 6sqrt{2} )Now, add ( m^2 + 3m + n ):( (9 - 4sqrt{2}) + (-3 + 6sqrt{2}) + (-1 - 2sqrt{2}) )Let me compute term by term:First, constants: 9 - 3 - 1 = 5Next, terms with ( sqrt{2} ): -4sqrt{2} + 6sqrt{2} - 2sqrt{2} = ( -4 + 6 - 2 )sqrt{2} = 0sqrt{2} = 0So, total is 5 + 0 = 5.Same result! So, that confirms it. The value is indeed 5.Alternatively, if I had chosen ( m = -1 - 2sqrt{2} ) and ( n = -1 + 2sqrt{2} ), would that change anything?Let me check:Compute ( m^2 ):( m = -1 - 2sqrt{2} )( m^2 = (-1 - 2sqrt{2})^2 = (-1)^2 + 2*(-1)*(-2sqrt{2}) + (-2sqrt{2})^2 = 1 + 4sqrt{2} + 8 = 9 + 4sqrt{2} )Compute ( 3m ):( 3m = 3*(-1 - 2sqrt{2}) = -3 - 6sqrt{2} )Add ( m^2 + 3m + n ):( (9 + 4sqrt{2}) + (-3 - 6sqrt{2}) + (-1 + 2sqrt{2}) )Compute constants: 9 - 3 -1 = 5Compute ( sqrt{2} ) terms: 4sqrt{2} -6sqrt{2} + 2sqrt{2} = (4 -6 +2)sqrt{2} = 0sqrt{2} = 0Total is 5 + 0 = 5.Same result again. So, regardless of which root is ( m ) or ( n ), the value is 5.Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 5.**Final Answer**The value of ( m^{2} + 3m + n ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"While one lion cub, who was 5 minutes away from the watering hole, went to get water, the second cub, who had already quenched his thirst, headed back along the same road 1.5 times faster than the first. At the same time, a turtle on the same road started heading to the watering hole from a distance of 30 minutes away. All three met at some point and then continued their journeys. How many minutes after the meeting did the turtle reach the watering hole, given that all three traveled at constant speeds?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about two lion cubs and a turtle. Let me try to visualize it. There's a watering hole, and one lion cub is 5 minutes away from it. That means if the cub starts moving towards the watering hole, it will take 5 minutes to get there. The other cub has already quenched his thirst, so he's heading back along the same road. He's moving 1.5 times faster than the first cub. At the same time, a turtle starts heading to the watering hole from a distance of 30 minutes away. All three meet at some point and then continue their journeys. The question is, how many minutes after the meeting did the turtle reach the watering hole?Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out the speeds of each animal. Since the first cub is 5 minutes away from the watering hole, his speed must be such that he covers that distance in 5 minutes. Similarly, the turtle is 30 minutes away, so its speed is such that it covers that distance in 30 minutes.Wait, but actually, the problem says all three met at some point. So, they started moving at the same time, but from different directions. The first cub is going towards the watering hole, the second cub is going away from it, and the turtle is going towards it as well.Wait, no. The first cub is going towards the watering hole, the second cub is going back along the same road, so that's away from the watering hole, right? And the turtle is going towards the watering hole from a distance of 30 minutes away. So, all three are on the same road, moving towards or away from the watering hole.So, the first cub is 5 minutes away, so if he starts moving towards the watering hole, he'll reach it in 5 minutes. The second cub is already at the watering hole, right? Because he quenched his thirst, so he's starting from the watering hole, heading back along the same road, which is away from the watering hole. So, he's moving in the opposite direction of the first cub.And the turtle is starting from a point 30 minutes away from the watering hole, moving towards it. So, all three start moving at the same time: the first cub towards the watering hole, the second cub away from it, and the turtle towards it.They meet at some point, and then continue their journeys. We need to find how many minutes after the meeting did the turtle reach the watering hole.Alright, let's denote some variables.Let me define:Let’s denote the speed of the first cub as ( v ). Then, since the second cub is moving 1.5 times faster, his speed is ( 1.5v ). The turtle's speed is ( u ).But wait, we don't know the turtle's speed yet. However, we know that the turtle is 30 minutes away from the watering hole. So, if the turtle is moving towards the watering hole, and the distance is 30 minutes away, that means the turtle's speed is such that it would take 30 minutes to cover that distance. So, if the distance is ( D ), then ( D = u times 30 ). So, ( u = D / 30 ).Similarly, the first cub is 5 minutes away from the watering hole, so ( D = v times 5 ). Therefore, ( v = D / 5 ).So, the second cub is moving at ( 1.5v = 1.5 times (D / 5) = (3/2) times (D / 5) = (3D)/10 ).So, speeds:- First cub: ( v = D / 5 )- Second cub: ( 1.5v = 3D / 10 )- Turtle: ( u = D / 30 )Now, let's figure out their positions as functions of time.Let’s denote the time when they meet as ( t ) minutes after they started moving.At time ( t ), the first cub has moved a distance of ( v times t = (D / 5) times t ) towards the watering hole.The second cub, starting from the watering hole, has moved a distance of ( (3D / 10) times t ) away from the watering hole.The turtle, starting from a point 30 minutes away from the watering hole, has moved a distance of ( u times t = (D / 30) times t ) towards the watering hole.Since they all meet at the same point, their positions relative to the watering hole must be equal at time ( t ).Wait, but the first cub is moving towards the watering hole, so his position is ( D - (D / 5) times t ). Wait, no. Let me clarify.Wait, actually, if the first cub is 5 minutes away, that means the distance from his starting point to the watering hole is ( D = v times 5 ). So, his position at time ( t ) is ( D - v t ).Similarly, the second cub is starting from the watering hole, moving away. So, his position at time ( t ) is ( 0 + (3D / 10) t ).The turtle is starting from a point 30 minutes away, so its starting position is ( D_{turtle} = u times 30 = (D / 30) times 30 = D ). Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on.Wait, if the turtle is 30 minutes away from the watering hole, and its speed is ( u ), then the distance from the turtle's starting point to the watering hole is ( u times 30 ). But we also have that the first cub is 5 minutes away, so the distance from his starting point to the watering hole is ( v times 5 ).Wait, but are these distances the same? Or are they different?Wait, the problem says \\"the same road.\\" So, the road is a straight line, with the watering hole somewhere on it. The first cub is 5 minutes away from the watering hole. The turtle is 30 minutes away from the watering hole. So, the distance from the first cub's starting point to the watering hole is ( D_1 = v times 5 ). The distance from the turtle's starting point to the watering hole is ( D_2 = u times 30 ).But are these two starting points on the same side of the watering hole? Or are they on opposite sides?Wait, the problem says \\"the same road.\\" So, the road is a straight line, and the watering hole is somewhere on it. The first cub is 5 minutes away from the watering hole, so he's on one side. The turtle is 30 minutes away from the watering hole, so he's on the same side as the first cub, or the opposite side?Wait, the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Hmm, but the second cub is heading back along the same road, so he started at the watering hole, moving away.So, the first cub is moving towards the watering hole, the second cub is moving away from it, and the turtle is moving towards it.So, if the first cub is 5 minutes away, and the turtle is 30 minutes away, they must be on the same side of the watering hole, right? Because otherwise, if the turtle was on the opposite side, the first cub and the turtle would be moving towards each other, but the second cub is moving away from the watering hole.Wait, maybe not necessarily. Let me think.Wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify the positions of the first cub and the turtle relative to each other. So, perhaps the first cub is 5 minutes away on one side, and the turtle is 30 minutes away on the other side.But that complicates things. Hmm.Wait, but the problem says \\"the same road.\\" So, maybe all three are on the same straight road, with the watering hole somewhere in the middle. The first cub is 5 minutes away from the watering hole on one side, the turtle is 30 minutes away on the other side, and the second cub starts at the watering hole, moving away.Wait, that might make sense. So, the first cub is 5 minutes away from the watering hole, moving towards it. The turtle is 30 minutes away from the watering hole on the opposite side, moving towards it. The second cub is starting at the watering hole, moving away in the same direction as the first cub.Wait, but the problem says the second cub is heading back along the same road, so he started at the watering hole, moving back along the same road, which would be away from the first cub.So, in that case, the first cub and the second cub are moving towards each other? Or away from each other?Wait, no. The first cub is moving towards the watering hole, and the second cub is moving away from it. So, if the first cub is on one side, moving towards the watering hole, and the second cub is starting at the watering hole, moving away in the opposite direction.Similarly, the turtle is on the same road, 30 minutes away from the watering hole, moving towards it.So, in this case, the first cub is moving towards the watering hole, the second cub is moving away from it, and the turtle is moving towards it from the opposite side.So, the first cub and the turtle are moving towards the watering hole, but from opposite sides, while the second cub is moving away from it.So, all three are on the same road, but the first cub and the turtle are on opposite sides of the watering hole, moving towards it, and the second cub is moving away from it.So, when they meet, it's somewhere on the road. So, the first cub is moving towards the watering hole, the second cub is moving away, and the turtle is moving towards the watering hole from the other side.So, their meeting point is somewhere on the road where all three cross paths.So, let's model this.Let me denote:Let’s assume the distance from the first cub's starting point to the watering hole is ( D ). So, the first cub's speed is ( v = D / 5 ).The turtle is 30 minutes away from the watering hole on the opposite side, so the distance from the turtle's starting point to the watering hole is ( 30u ), where ( u ) is the turtle's speed.But since the road is straight, the total distance between the first cub's starting point and the turtle's starting point is ( D + 30u ).But wait, actually, if the first cub is ( D ) away from the watering hole, and the turtle is ( 30u ) away on the opposite side, then the distance between their starting points is ( D + 30u ).But since they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is ( v + u ). But wait, no, because the first cub is moving towards the watering hole, and the turtle is moving towards the watering hole as well, but from opposite sides.Wait, so actually, their paths are converging towards the watering hole, but they might not meet each other directly unless they cross paths somewhere.Wait, maybe I need to model their positions as functions of time.Let’s set up a coordinate system where the watering hole is at position 0. Let's say the first cub starts at position ( D ) (5 minutes away from the watering hole), moving towards 0. The turtle starts at position ( -30u ) (30 minutes away from the watering hole on the opposite side), moving towards 0. The second cub starts at position 0, moving away in the positive direction (towards the first cub's starting point) at speed ( 1.5v ).So, positions as functions of time ( t ):- First cub: ( D - v t )- Second cub: ( 0 + 1.5v t )- Turtle: ( -30u + u t )They all meet at the same point at time ( t ). So, their positions must be equal.So, we have:1. ( D - v t = 1.5v t ) (First cub and second cub meet)2. ( D - v t = -30u + u t ) (First cub and turtle meet)So, two equations:1. ( D - v t = 1.5v t )2. ( D - v t = -30u + u t )Let me solve the first equation for ( D ):( D = 1.5v t + v t = 2.5v t )So, ( D = 2.5v t )From the first cub's speed, we know ( v = D / 5 ). So, substituting:( D = 2.5 times (D / 5) times t )Simplify:( D = (2.5 / 5) D t )( D = 0.5 D t )Divide both sides by D (assuming D ≠ 0):( 1 = 0.5 t )So, ( t = 2 ) minutes.So, they meet after 2 minutes.Now, let's use the second equation to find the relationship between ( u ) and ( v ).From equation 2:( D - v t = -30u + u t )We already know ( D = 2.5v t ) and ( t = 2 ). Let's substitute ( t = 2 ):( D - v times 2 = -30u + u times 2 )But ( D = 2.5v times 2 = 5v ). So, substitute D:( 5v - 2v = -30u + 2u )( 3v = -28u )Wait, that can't be right. Because 3v = -28u would imply that u is negative, which doesn't make sense because the turtle is moving towards the watering hole, so its speed should be positive.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate system.Wait, in the coordinate system, the turtle is starting at position ( -30u ), moving towards 0 at speed ( u ). So, its position at time ( t ) is ( -30u + u t ). The first cub is at ( D - v t ). So, when they meet, ( D - v t = -30u + u t ).But we found that ( D = 5v ) because ( D = v times 5 ). Wait, hold on, earlier I said ( D = v times 5 ), because the first cub is 5 minutes away. So, ( D = 5v ).Wait, but from the first equation, ( D = 2.5v t ), and we found ( t = 2 ), so ( D = 5v ). That's consistent.So, substituting ( D = 5v ) into the second equation:( 5v - 2v = -30u + 2u )( 3v = -28u )Hmm, so 3v = -28u. But u is positive, so this would imply v is negative, which doesn't make sense because v is the speed of the first cub towards the watering hole.Wait, maybe I messed up the coordinate system. Let me double-check.I set the watering hole at 0. The first cub starts at D (positive side), moving towards 0. The turtle starts at -30u (negative side), moving towards 0. The second cub starts at 0, moving towards positive direction (away from the watering hole).So, when the first cub and the second cub meet, their positions are equal. So, the first cub is moving from D to 0, and the second cub is moving from 0 to positive infinity. So, they meet somewhere between D and 0? Wait, no, because the first cub is moving towards 0, and the second cub is moving away from 0 in the positive direction. So, they can only meet if they cross each other, but since the first cub is moving towards 0 and the second cub is moving away from 0, they would only meet if the first cub overtakes the second cub, but the second cub is moving faster.Wait, actually, the second cub is moving 1.5 times faster than the first cub. So, the second cub is moving faster away from 0 than the first cub is moving towards 0. So, they can't meet unless the first cub is moving towards 0 and the second cub is moving towards positive, but since they are moving in opposite directions relative to 0, they can't meet unless they pass each other. Wait, but in this case, the first cub is moving towards 0, and the second cub is moving away from 0, so they are moving away from each other. So, how can they meet?Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the first cub is moving towards 0 and the second cub is moving away from 0, they can't meet unless they are moving towards each other. Wait, maybe I misassigned the directions.Wait, perhaps the second cub is moving back along the same road, which is the road from the watering hole to the first cub's starting point. So, if the first cub is moving towards the watering hole, and the second cub is moving back along the same road, meaning away from the watering hole, towards the first cub's starting point.Wait, but if the second cub is moving back along the same road, that would mean he's moving in the same direction as the first cub is moving towards the watering hole. Wait, no, the first cub is moving towards the watering hole, so the road is from the first cub's starting point to the watering hole. So, moving back along the same road would be away from the watering hole, towards the first cub's starting point.So, in that case, the second cub is moving away from the watering hole, in the same direction as the first cub's starting point.Wait, so in the coordinate system, the first cub is at D, moving towards 0. The second cub is at 0, moving towards D. The turtle is at -30u, moving towards 0.So, in that case, the first cub and the second cub are moving towards each other, so they will meet somewhere between D and 0.Similarly, the turtle is moving towards 0 from the negative side.So, in that case, all three meet at the same point at time t.So, let's redefine the positions:- First cub: starting at D, moving towards 0 at speed v. Position at time t: ( D - v t )- Second cub: starting at 0, moving towards D at speed 1.5v. Position at time t: ( 0 + 1.5v t )- Turtle: starting at -30u, moving towards 0 at speed u. Position at time t: ( -30u + u t )So, all three meet at the same position, so:1. ( D - v t = 1.5v t )2. ( D - v t = -30u + u t )So, equation 1:( D = 1.5v t + v t = 2.5v t )So, ( D = 2.5v t )But we also know that the first cub is 5 minutes away from the watering hole, so ( D = v times 5 ). Therefore,( 5v = 2.5v t )Divide both sides by v (v ≠ 0):( 5 = 2.5 t )So, ( t = 2 ) minutes.So, they meet after 2 minutes.Now, equation 2:( D - v t = -30u + u t )We know D = 5v and t = 2, so:( 5v - v times 2 = -30u + u times 2 )( 5v - 2v = -30u + 2u )( 3v = -28u )Wait, again, this gives 3v = -28u, which would imply u is negative, but u is the speed of the turtle towards the watering hole, so it should be positive. So, this is a problem.Wait, maybe I messed up the coordinate system again. Let me think.If the turtle is moving towards the watering hole from the negative side, its position is ( -30u + u t ). The first cub is moving towards the watering hole from the positive side, position ( D - v t ). The second cub is moving towards the positive side from 0, position ( 1.5v t ).Wait, but if all three meet at the same point, then the first cub and the second cub meet at position ( D - v t = 1.5v t ), which gives D = 2.5v t, as before.But the turtle is moving towards 0 from the negative side, so its position is ( -30u + u t ). So, when the first cub and the second cub meet at position ( 1.5v t ), the turtle must also be at that position.So, ( 1.5v t = -30u + u t )So, substituting t = 2:( 1.5v times 2 = -30u + u times 2 )( 3v = -30u + 2u )( 3v = -28u )Again, same result. Hmm.Wait, maybe the issue is that the turtle is moving towards the watering hole, so its speed is positive, but in the coordinate system, it's moving from negative to positive, so its position increases over time. So, the equation should be correct.But getting 3v = -28u is problematic because u is positive.Wait, unless the turtle is actually moving away from the watering hole, but the problem says it's heading to the watering hole. So, that can't be.Wait, perhaps I have the direction of the second cub wrong. Maybe the second cub is moving back along the same road, which is the road from the first cub's starting point to the watering hole. So, if the first cub is moving towards the watering hole, the second cub is moving back along that same road, meaning away from the watering hole, towards the first cub's starting point.Wait, but in that case, the second cub is moving away from the watering hole, so in the coordinate system, from 0 towards D.Wait, so in that case, the second cub is moving in the same direction as the first cub's starting point. So, the first cub is moving towards 0, the second cub is moving towards D, so they are moving towards each other.Wait, but in that case, their positions would be:First cub: ( D - v t )Second cub: ( 0 + 1.5v t )So, when they meet, ( D - v t = 1.5v t ), which gives D = 2.5v t, as before.But the turtle is moving towards 0 from the negative side, so its position is ( -30u + u t ). So, when they meet, the turtle must be at the same position as the first and second cubs.So, ( D - v t = -30u + u t )But with D = 2.5v t, substituting:( 2.5v t - v t = -30u + u t )( 1.5v t = -30u + u t )But we know t = 2, so:( 1.5v times 2 = -30u + u times 2 )( 3v = -30u + 2u )( 3v = -28u )Again, same issue.Wait, maybe the turtle is on the same side as the first cub? So, both the first cub and the turtle are starting from the same side, 5 and 30 minutes away from the watering hole, respectively.Wait, the problem says \\"the same road,\\" but it doesn't specify whether the turtle is on the same side as the first cub or the opposite side.Wait, if the turtle is on the same side as the first cub, then the distance between the first cub and the turtle is 25 minutes away (since 30 - 5 = 25). But that might complicate things.Wait, let me reread the problem.\\"the second cub, who had already quenched his thirst, headed back along the same road 1.5 times faster than the first. At the same time, a turtle on the same road started heading to the watering hole from a distance of 30 minutes away.\\"So, the turtle is on the same road, starting from a distance of 30 minutes away. It doesn't specify the direction, so it could be on either side.But given that the second cub is heading back along the same road, which is the road that the first cub is on, so the road is from the first cub's starting point to the watering hole. So, the turtle is on that same road, starting from a distance of 30 minutes away. So, it's either on the same side as the first cub, 30 minutes away, or on the opposite side, 30 minutes away.But if it's on the same side as the first cub, then the first cub is 5 minutes away, and the turtle is 30 minutes away, so the distance between them is 25 minutes. If they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is v + u, so they would meet in (25)/(v + u) minutes.But the second cub is moving back along the same road, which is towards the first cub's starting point, at 1.5v speed.So, in that case, the first cub is moving towards the watering hole, the second cub is moving away from the watering hole towards the first cub's starting point, and the turtle is moving towards the watering hole from the same side as the first cub.So, in this case, the first cub and the turtle are moving towards the watering hole, while the second cub is moving away.So, in this case, the first cub and the turtle are moving towards the same point, while the second cub is moving away.So, let's model this.Set the watering hole at 0.First cub starts at position D = 5v, moving towards 0 at speed v.Turtle starts at position E = 30u, moving towards 0 at speed u.Second cub starts at 0, moving towards positive infinity at speed 1.5v.So, positions at time t:First cub: ( D - v t = 5v - v t )Turtle: ( 30u - u t )Second cub: ( 0 + 1.5v t )They all meet at the same point at time t, so:1. ( 5v - v t = 1.5v t )2. ( 5v - v t = 30u - u t )From equation 1:( 5v = 1.5v t + v t = 2.5v t )Divide both sides by v:( 5 = 2.5 t )So, ( t = 2 ) minutes.From equation 2:( 5v - v times 2 = 30u - u times 2 )( 5v - 2v = 30u - 2u )( 3v = 28u )So, ( u = (3v)/28 )So, the turtle's speed is ( 3v/28 ).Now, the turtle started 30 minutes away from the watering hole, so the distance is ( 30u ). Wait, but we have ( u = 3v / 28 ), so ( 30u = 30 times (3v / 28) = 90v / 28 = 45v / 14 ).But the first cub's distance is ( D = 5v ). So, if the turtle is on the same side as the first cub, the distance between them is ( 30u - D = (45v / 14) - 5v = (45v - 70v)/14 = (-25v)/14 ). Negative distance doesn't make sense, so perhaps the turtle is on the opposite side.Wait, maybe I need to consider the turtle on the opposite side.So, let's assume the turtle is on the opposite side of the watering hole relative to the first cub.So, the first cub is at D = 5v, moving towards 0.The turtle is at -30u, moving towards 0.The second cub is at 0, moving towards D at 1.5v.So, positions at time t:First cub: ( 5v - v t )Turtle: ( -30u + u t )Second cub: ( 0 + 1.5v t )They meet at the same point, so:1. ( 5v - v t = 1.5v t )2. ( 5v - v t = -30u + u t )From equation 1:( 5v = 2.5v t )( t = 2 ) minutes.From equation 2:( 5v - 2v = -30u + 2u )( 3v = -28u )Again, same problem: 3v = -28u, which would imply u is negative. But u is positive because the turtle is moving towards the watering hole.Wait, so perhaps the turtle is on the same side as the first cub, but the distance is 30 minutes away in the same direction as the first cub's starting point. So, the first cub is 5 minutes away, the turtle is 30 minutes away on the same side, so the distance between them is 25 minutes.So, the first cub is moving towards the watering hole at speed v, the turtle is moving towards the watering hole at speed u, so their relative speed is v + u. The distance between them is 25 minutes, so the time until they meet is 25 / (v + u). But we also have that the second cub is moving away from the watering hole at 1.5v, and meets the first cub at t = 2 minutes.Wait, but if the first cub and the second cub meet at t = 2, then the turtle must also meet them at t = 2.So, let's see.If the turtle is on the same side as the first cub, starting 30 minutes away, moving towards the watering hole at speed u.The first cub is 5 minutes away, moving towards the watering hole at speed v.So, the distance between the first cub and the turtle is 25 minutes (30 - 5). They are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is v + u.Time until they meet is 25 / (v + u). But we know they meet at t = 2 minutes.So,25 / (v + u) = 2So,v + u = 25 / 2 = 12.5But we also have from the first cub and the second cub meeting:From equation 1:t = 2 minutes.From the first cub's speed, D = 5v.From the second cub's speed, 1.5v.They meet at position:First cub: 5v - v * 2 = 3vSecond cub: 1.5v * 2 = 3vSo, they meet at position 3v.Now, the turtle is moving towards the watering hole, starting from 30u away on the same side as the first cub. So, its position at time t is 30u - u t.At t = 2, it must be at position 3v.So,30u - u * 2 = 3vSo,28u = 3vThus,u = (3v)/28So, the turtle's speed is (3v)/28.Now, the distance from the turtle's starting point to the meeting point is 30u - 3v.But wait, the turtle started at 30u, moving towards 0, so the distance it covers in 2 minutes is u * 2 = (3v)/28 * 2 = (3v)/14.So, the distance from the turtle's starting point to the meeting point is 30u - (u * 2) = 30u - 2u = 28u.But 28u = 3v, as we found earlier. So, 28u = 3v, so the distance from the turtle's starting point to the meeting point is 3v.But the distance from the meeting point to the watering hole is 3v, since the first cub was at 5v and moved 2v to reach 3v.Wait, but the turtle is moving towards the watering hole, so from the meeting point, it still has 3v distance to go.Wait, but the turtle's speed is u = 3v / 28.So, the time it takes for the turtle to go from the meeting point to the watering hole is (3v) / u = (3v) / (3v / 28) = 28 minutes.Wait, that seems straightforward.But let me verify.So, the turtle starts at 30u, which is 30 * (3v / 28) = 90v / 28 = 45v / 14 ≈ 3.214v.At t = 2, it has moved u * 2 = (3v / 28) * 2 = 3v / 14 ≈ 0.214v.So, its position is 45v / 14 - 3v / 14 = 42v / 14 = 3v, which matches the meeting point.From the meeting point, the distance to the watering hole is 3v.So, time to reach the watering hole after meeting is (3v) / u = (3v) / (3v / 28) = 28 minutes.So, the answer is 28 minutes.Wait, but let me make sure.Alternatively, since the turtle meets the cubs after 2 minutes, and it started 30 minutes away, but it's moving at speed u. So, the time it takes to reach the watering hole after meeting is the remaining distance divided by its speed.The remaining distance is 30u - u * 2 = 28u.But 28u = 3v, as we found earlier.So, time = 28u / u = 28 minutes.Yes, that's consistent.Therefore, the turtle reaches the watering hole 28 minutes after the meeting.**Final Answer**The turtle reached the watering hole boxed{28} minutes after the meeting."},{"question":"Calculate: (2sqrt{3}-pi)^{0}-|1-sqrt{3}|+3tan 30^{circ}+(-frac{1}{2})^{-2}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this expression to calculate: (2sqrt{3} - pi)^{0} - |1 - sqrt{3}| + 3tan 30^{circ} + (-frac{1}{2})^{-2}. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I remember that when dealing with exponents, absolute values, trigonometric functions, and negative exponents, I need to handle each part carefully.First, let's look at the term (2sqrt{3} - pi)^{0}. I recall that any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So, regardless of what's inside the parentheses, as long as it's not zero, this should be 1. Is 2sqrt{3} - pi zero? Let me approximate the values. sqrt{3} is approximately 1.732, so 2sqrt{3} is about 3.464. pi is approximately 3.1416. So, 3.464 minus 3.1416 is roughly 0.3224, which is definitely not zero. So, this term is 1.Next, the term is -|1 - sqrt{3}|. Absolute value signs can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, so it's always non-negative. Let's compute the inside first: 1 - sqrt{3}. Since sqrt{3} is about 1.732, subtracting that from 1 gives approximately -0.732. The absolute value of that is 0.732, but since there's a negative sign in front, it becomes -0.732. So, this term is approximately -0.732.Moving on to the next term: 3tan 30^{circ}. I remember that tan 30^{circ} is one of those special angles. Let me recall, tan 30^{circ} is equal to frac{sqrt{3}}{3} or approximately 0.577. So, multiplying that by 3 gives us exactly sqrt{3}, which is approximately 1.732. So, this term is sqrt{3}.Lastly, the term is (-frac{1}{2})^{-2}. Negative exponents mean reciprocals, right? So, (-frac{1}{2})^{-2} is the same as (-2)^{2} because taking the reciprocal of -frac{1}{2} gives -2. Then, squaring that gives 4. So, this term is 4.Now, let me put all these together:1. (2sqrt{3} - pi)^{0} = 12. -|1 - sqrt{3}| approx -0.7323. 3tan 30^{circ} = sqrt{3} approx 1.7324. (-frac{1}{2})^{-2} = 4Adding them all up:1 + (-0.732) + 1.732 + 4.Let me compute this step by step:First, 1 - 0.732 is 0.268.Then, 0.268 + 1.732 is 2.Finally, 2 + 4 is 6.Wait, that seems too clean. Let me check my calculations again.Starting with the absolute value term: |1 - sqrt{3}| is indeed sqrt{3} - 1 because sqrt{3} is greater than 1. So, -|1 - sqrt{3}| is -(sqrt{3} - 1) which is - sqrt{3} + 1. So, maybe I should write all the terms symbolically first before plugging in approximate numbers.Let me rewrite the expression:1 - |1 - √3| + 3 tan 30° + (-1/2)^{-2}Breaking it down:1 - (|1 - √3|) + 3*(√3/3) + ( (-2)^2 )Simplify each term:1 - ( √3 - 1 ) + √3 + 4Because |1 - √3| is √3 - 1 since √3 > 1.So, substituting:1 - √3 + 1 + √3 + 4Now, let's combine like terms:1 + 1 + 4 = 6-√3 + √3 = 0So, the total is 6 + 0 = 6.Ah, so that's why it came out to 6. I see, when I approximated earlier, I might have made a mistake in the decimal places, but symbolically, it's much cleaner.So, in the symbolic approach, the √3 terms cancel out, and the constants add up to 6. That makes sense. So, the answer is 6.I think my initial approximation was correct, but when I did it symbolically, it's clearer. So, the final result is 6.**Final Answer**The value of the expression is boxed{6}."},{"question":"Determine the units digit of the product of 1.5 multiplied by itself 200 times.","answer":"First, I need to understand the problem.

This can be written as (3^200)/(2^200).To find the units digit of this product, I'll focus on the units digit of 3^200. The units digits of powers of 3 follow a repeating cycle: 3, 9, 7, 1.

Let me try to remember what a geometric sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, right? So, if the first term is ( a_1 ), then the second term is ( a_1 times r ), the third term is ( a_1 times r^2 ), and so on. So, in general, the ( n )-th term is ( a_n = a_1 times r^{n-1} ).The problem says that in the geometric sequence ( {a_n} ), ( a_1 + a_2 = 20 ) and ( a_3 + a_4 = 40 ). Then it asks for ( a_5 + a_6 ). Hmm, okay. Let me write down what I know.First, let's express each term using the formula for a geometric sequence.- ( a_1 = a_1 ) (obviously)- ( a_2 = a_1 times r )- ( a_3 = a_1 times r^2 )- ( a_4 = a_1 times r^3 )- ( a_5 = a_1 times r^4 )- ( a_6 = a_1 times r^5 )So, the given information is:1. ( a_1 + a_2 = 20 )2. ( a_3 + a_4 = 40 )Let me substitute the expressions for ( a_2 ), ( a_3 ), and ( a_4 ) into these equations.Starting with the first equation:( a_1 + a_2 = a_1 + a_1 r = 20 )I can factor out ( a_1 ):( a_1 (1 + r) = 20 )  -- Let's call this Equation (1)Now, the second equation:( a_3 + a_4 = a_1 r^2 + a_1 r^3 = 40 )Again, factor out ( a_1 r^2 ):( a_1 r^2 (1 + r) = 40 )  -- Let's call this Equation (2)Hmm, so now I have two equations:1. ( a_1 (1 + r) = 20 )2. ( a_1 r^2 (1 + r) = 40 )I notice that both equations have ( a_1 (1 + r) ) as a common factor. From Equation (1), ( a_1 (1 + r) = 20 ). So, I can substitute this into Equation (2):( 20 times r^2 = 40 )That simplifies to:( 20 r^2 = 40 )Divide both sides by 20:( r^2 = 2 )So, ( r = sqrt{2} ) or ( r = -sqrt{2} ). Hmm, so the common ratio could be positive or negative square root of 2. I wonder if both are possible or if only one makes sense in this context.Well, in a geometric sequence, the common ratio can be positive or negative, so both are possible. But let's see if both lead to valid solutions.First, let's take ( r = sqrt{2} ).From Equation (1):( a_1 (1 + sqrt{2}) = 20 )So, ( a_1 = frac{20}{1 + sqrt{2}} )To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by ( 1 - sqrt{2} ):( a_1 = frac{20 (1 - sqrt{2})}{(1 + sqrt{2})(1 - sqrt{2})} )The denominator becomes ( 1 - 2 = -1 ), so:( a_1 = frac{20 (1 - sqrt{2})}{-1} = -20 (1 - sqrt{2}) = -20 + 20 sqrt{2} )So, ( a_1 = 20 (sqrt{2} - 1) )Okay, that seems fine.Now, if ( r = -sqrt{2} ), let's see:From Equation (1):( a_1 (1 - sqrt{2}) = 20 )So, ( a_1 = frac{20}{1 - sqrt{2}} )Again, rationalizing the denominator:Multiply numerator and denominator by ( 1 + sqrt{2} ):( a_1 = frac{20 (1 + sqrt{2})}{(1 - sqrt{2})(1 + sqrt{2})} )Denominator is ( 1 - 2 = -1 ):( a_1 = frac{20 (1 + sqrt{2})}{-1} = -20 (1 + sqrt{2}) = -20 - 20 sqrt{2} )So, ( a_1 = -20 (1 + sqrt{2}) )That also seems valid. So, both possibilities for ( r ) give us valid first terms. So, we have two possible geometric sequences here.Now, the question is asking for ( a_5 + a_6 ). Let's express ( a_5 ) and ( a_6 ) in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( r ):( a_5 = a_1 r^4 )( a_6 = a_1 r^5 )So, ( a_5 + a_6 = a_1 r^4 + a_1 r^5 = a_1 r^4 (1 + r) )Hmm, interesting. So, similar to how we had ( a_1 (1 + r) ) earlier, here we have ( a_1 r^4 (1 + r) ).From Equation (1), we know that ( a_1 (1 + r) = 20 ). So, if we can express ( a_5 + a_6 ) in terms of that, we can substitute.Let me write:( a_5 + a_6 = a_1 r^4 (1 + r) = (a_1 (1 + r)) times r^4 = 20 times r^4 )So, ( a_5 + a_6 = 20 r^4 )So, if I can find ( r^4 ), I can compute this.Earlier, we found that ( r^2 = 2 ), so ( r^4 = (r^2)^2 = 2^2 = 4 )Therefore, ( a_5 + a_6 = 20 times 4 = 80 )Wait, so regardless of whether ( r ) is ( sqrt{2} ) or ( -sqrt{2} ), ( r^4 ) is positive 4, because squaring either gives positive 2, and then squaring again gives 4.So, whether ( r ) is positive or negative, ( r^4 ) is 4, so ( a_5 + a_6 = 80 )Therefore, the answer is 80.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Expressed ( a_1 + a_2 ) and ( a_3 + a_4 ) in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( r ).2. Factored out ( a_1 (1 + r) ) from both equations.3. Substituted Equation (1) into Equation (2) to find ( r^2 = 2 ).4. Then, for ( a_5 + a_6 ), expressed it as ( a_1 r^4 (1 + r) ), which is ( 20 r^4 ).5. Since ( r^4 = (r^2)^2 = 4 ), so ( 20 times 4 = 80 ).Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 80.**Final Answer**The value of ( a_5 + a_6 ) is boxed{80}."},{"question":"The smallest positive integer x for which 1260x=N^3, where N is an integer, is:textbf{(A)} 1050 qquad textbf{(B)} 1260 qquad textbf{(C)} 1260^2 qquad textbf{(D)} 7350 qquad textbf{(6)} 44100","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest positive integer x such that 1260x is a perfect cube. The options are given, but I think I should try to figure it out myself first.Okay, let me recall what a perfect cube is. A perfect cube is a number that can be written as N³ where N is an integer. So, if 1260x is a perfect cube, then all the prime factors in 1260x must have exponents that are multiples of 3.Hmm, so maybe I should start by factoring 1260 into its prime components. Let me do that step by step.1260. Let's divide by 2 first: 1260 ÷ 2 = 630. That's one 2.630 ÷ 2 = 315. That's two 2s.Wait, no, 630 is not divisible by 2 again because it's 630, which ends with a 0, but 630 ÷ 2 is 315, which is correct. So, 2² so far.Now, 315. Let's divide by 3: 315 ÷ 3 = 105. That's one 3.105 ÷ 3 = 35. That's two 3s.35 ÷ 3 is not an integer, so we stop. So, 3².Now, 35. Let's divide by 5: 35 ÷ 5 = 7. That's one 5.7 is a prime number, so we have 7¹.So, putting it all together, 1260 factors into 2² × 3² × 5¹ × 7¹.Okay, so 1260 = 2² × 3² × 5 × 7.Now, we need to find the smallest x such that when we multiply 1260 by x, the result is a perfect cube. That means that in the prime factorization of 1260x, each prime's exponent must be a multiple of 3.So, let's look at each prime factor:- For 2: exponent is 2. To get to the next multiple of 3, which is 3, we need to add 1 more 2. So, x needs to have 2¹.- For 3: exponent is 2. Similarly, we need 1 more 3. So, x needs 3¹.- For 5: exponent is 1. The next multiple of 3 is 3, so we need 2 more 5s. So, x needs 5².- For 7: exponent is 1. Same as 5, we need 2 more 7s. So, x needs 7².Wait, let me check that again. If the exponent is 1, to get to 3, we need 2 more, right? Because 1 + 2 = 3. So yes, x needs 5² and 7².So, putting it all together, x should be 2¹ × 3¹ × 5² × 7².Let me calculate that:First, 2 × 3 = 6.Then, 5² is 25, and 7² is 49.So, 6 × 25 = 150.150 × 49. Hmm, let me compute that. 150 × 50 would be 7500, but since it's 150 × 49, that's 7500 - 150 = 7350.So, x is 7350.Let me check the options: A) 1050, B) 1260, C) 1260², D) 7350, E) 44100.So, D is 7350, which is what I got. So, that should be the answer.But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me verify.If x is 7350, then 1260 × 7350. Let me compute that.First, 1260 × 7000 = 8,820,000.Then, 1260 × 350 = let's see, 1260 × 300 = 378,000, and 1260 × 50 = 63,000. So, 378,000 + 63,000 = 441,000.So, total is 8,820,000 + 441,000 = 9,261,000.Is 9,261,000 a perfect cube? Let me see.Let me factor 9,261,000.But wait, since we already factored 1260 and x, maybe it's better to look at the exponents.1260 is 2² × 3² × 5 × 7.x is 2 × 3 × 5² × 7².So, multiplying them together:2² × 2¹ = 2³3² × 3¹ = 3³5¹ × 5² = 5³7¹ × 7² = 7³So, 1260x = 2³ × 3³ × 5³ × 7³, which is (2 × 3 × 5 × 7)³.Calculating that: 2 × 3 = 6, 6 × 5 = 30, 30 × 7 = 210. So, 210³.Indeed, 210³ is 9,261,000, which matches our earlier calculation. So, yes, it's a perfect cube.Therefore, x is indeed 7350, which is option D.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"There are various ways to make 207 using only 2 coins and 5 bills. One such way is using one 2 coin and forty-one 5 bills. Including this way, in how many different ways can 207 be made using only 2 coins and 5 bills? (A) 9 (B) 10 (C) 19 (D) 41 (E) 21","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to figure out how many different ways I can make 207 using only 2 coins and 5 bills. They gave an example where you use one 2 coin and forty-one 5 bills, and they want to know how many such ways there are in total, including that example. The options are A) 9, B) 10, C) 19, D) 41, E) 21.Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a classic coin change problem, but with only two denominations: 2 and 5. So, I need to find all the combinations of 2 coins and 5 bills that add up to 207.Let me denote the number of 2 coins as x and the number of 5 bills as y. Then, the total amount would be 2x + 5y = 207. So, I need to find all non-negative integer solutions (x, y) to this equation.Alright, so I can rewrite the equation as 2x = 207 - 5y. Therefore, x = (207 - 5y)/2. Since x has to be a non-negative integer, (207 - 5y) must be even and non-negative.First, let's consider the non-negativity. So, 207 - 5y ≥ 0. That implies 5y ≤ 207, so y ≤ 207/5. Calculating that, 207 divided by 5 is 41.4. But since y has to be an integer, the maximum y can be is 41. So y can range from 0 to 41.But wait, not all y in that range will make (207 - 5y) even. So, I need to find all y such that 207 - 5y is even. Let's analyze the parity here.207 is an odd number, and 5y is either odd or even depending on y. Since 5 is odd, 5y is odd if y is odd and even if y is even. So, 207 - 5y will be even only if 5y is odd because odd minus odd is even. Therefore, y must be odd for (207 - 5y) to be even.So, y has to be an odd integer between 0 and 41. So, let's list the possible y values.Starting from y=0: but y=0 would make 207 - 0 = 207, which is odd, so x would be 207/2, which is 103.5, not an integer. So y=0 is invalid.Next, y=1: 207 - 5*1 = 202, which is even. So x=202/2=101. That's valid.Then y=2: 207 - 10 = 197, which is odd. So x would be 197/2=98.5, invalid.y=3: 207 - 15=192, which is even. x=96.y=4: 207 -20=187, odd. x=93.5, invalid.y=5: 207 -25=182, even. x=91.Hmm, I see a pattern here. Every time y increases by 2, starting from y=1, we get a valid x. So, the valid y's are all the odd numbers from 1 up to the maximum y, which is 41.Wait, but 41 is odd, so that's fine. So, how many odd numbers are there from 1 to 41 inclusive?Well, the number of odd numbers between 1 and n inclusive is (n + 1)/2 if n is odd. So, 41 is odd, so (41 + 1)/2 = 21. So, there are 21 odd numbers from 1 to 41.But wait, hold on. Let me check if y=41 is valid. y=41: 207 - 5*41=207 - 205=2, which is even. So x=2/2=1. That's the example given in the problem: 1 2 coin and 41 5 bills. So, that's valid.So, starting from y=1, y=3, y=5,..., y=41, each step of 2, gives us a valid x. So, how many such y's are there?As I calculated, 21. So, that would mean 21 different ways. But wait, the options are A)9, B)10, C)19, D)41, E)21.So, 21 is an option, E. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes when counting inclusive ranges, it's easy to make a mistake.Wait, another way to think about it: the number of solutions is equal to the number of valid y's, which are the odd numbers from 1 to 41. So, how many terms are in the sequence 1,3,5,...,41?This is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1, last term 41, common difference 2.Number of terms = ((last term - first term)/common difference) + 1 = ((41 -1)/2)+1 = (40/2)+1=20+1=21. So, 21 terms.Therefore, 21 different ways. So, the answer should be E)21.But wait, hold on. Let me think again. The problem says \\"using only 2 coins and 5 bills.\\" So, does that mean that we have to use at least one of each? Because sometimes in these problems, they specify \\"using at least one of each,\\" but in this case, it's not specified.Wait, the example they gave uses one 2 coin and forty-one 5 bills, so that's a valid way. But what about using zero 2 coins and all 5 bills? Is that allowed?Wait, 207 divided by 5 is 41.4, which is not an integer, so you can't make 207 with only 5 bills. Similarly, 207 divided by 2 is 103.5, so you can't make it with only 2 coins. So, both x and y have to be positive integers? Or can they be zero?Wait, the problem says \\"using only 2 coins and 5 bills.\\" So, does that mean you can use any combination, including zero of one type? Or does it mean you have to use at least one of each?Looking back at the problem: \\"There are various ways to make 207 using only 2 coins and 5 bills. One such way is using one 2 coin and forty-one 5 bills. Including this way, in how many different ways can 207 be made using only 2 coins and 5 bills?\\"So, the wording is \\"using only 2 coins and 5 bills,\\" which might imply that you can use any number, including zero, of each, as long as the total is 207. But since 207 isn't a multiple of 2 or 5, you can't have all coins or all bills. So, both x and y have to be at least 1? Or can they be zero?Wait, if y=0, then 2x=207, which is not possible because 207 is odd. Similarly, x=0 would require 5y=207, which is also not possible because 207 isn't a multiple of 5. So, both x and y have to be at least 1. So, in that case, y can be from 1 to 41, but only the odd y's, which are 21 in total.But wait, hold on. If y=1, then x=101, which is allowed. y=3, x=96, and so on, up to y=41, x=1. So, all these are valid, with x and y being positive integers.Therefore, the number of ways is 21, which is option E.But wait, the options include 21, so that's E. But let me check the problem again. It says \\"including this way,\\" which is one 2 and forty-one 5s. So, that's one way, and we have 21 total, so that includes that one.But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of terms.Wait, the number of odd numbers from 1 to 41 inclusive is 21, right? Because 41 divided by 2 is 20.5, so 20 full steps, plus 1 gives 21.Alternatively, think of it as y can be 1,3,5,...,41. So, how many terms? Let's compute (41 -1)/2 +1 = 20 +1=21. So, 21 terms.Therefore, 21 ways. So, the answer is E)21.But wait, the options are A)9, B)10, C)19, D)41, E)21.So, 21 is an option, so I think that's correct.But wait, another way to think about it: Let me model this as a linear Diophantine equation.We have 2x + 5y = 207.We can solve for x: x = (207 - 5y)/2.For x to be a non-negative integer, (207 -5y) must be even and non-negative.As before, 207 is odd, 5y must be odd, so y must be odd.So, y must be odd and satisfy 5y ≤207 => y ≤41.4, so y ≤41.So, y can be 1,3,5,...,41. As before, 21 terms.Therefore, 21 different ways.So, yeah, I think E)21 is the correct answer.Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute for a few y's and see if x is integer.y=1: 207-5=202, 202/2=101. Valid.y=3: 207-15=192, 192/2=96. Valid.y=5: 207-25=182, 182/2=91. Valid.y=7: 207-35=172, 172/2=86. Valid.Continuing, y=9: 207-45=162, 162/2=81. Valid.Similarly, y=11: 207-55=152, 152/2=76. Valid.Continuing this way, each time y increases by 2, x decreases by 5/2*2=5. Wait, no, actually, each time y increases by 2, 5y increases by 10, so 207 -5y decreases by 10, so x decreases by 5.So, x starts at 101 when y=1, then 96, 91, 86, 81, 76, etc., each time decreasing by 5.So, how many steps do we take? From y=1 to y=41, stepping by 2 each time.Number of steps is (41 -1)/2 +1=21.So, 21 different x's, each corresponding to a unique y.Therefore, 21 ways.So, yeah, I think that's solid. So, the answer is E)21.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"The sequence (a_{n}) is defined as follows:(a_{1} = 1), (a_{n+1} = a_{n} + frac{2a_{n}}{n}) for (n geq 1). Find (a_{999}).","answer":"Okay, so I have this sequence where ( a_1 = 1 ) and each subsequent term is defined by ( a_{n+1} = a_n + frac{2a_n}{n} ) for ( n geq 1 ). I need to find ( a_{999} ). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down the recurrence relation again to make sure I have it right:( a_{n+1} = a_n + frac{2a_n}{n} )Hmm, that can be simplified a bit. Let me factor out ( a_n ):( a_{n+1} = a_n left(1 + frac{2}{n}right) )So, each term is the previous term multiplied by ( 1 + frac{2}{n} ). That seems like a multiplicative factor. Maybe I can express this as a product of these factors?Let me try writing out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.Starting with ( a_1 = 1 ).Then,( a_2 = a_1 left(1 + frac{2}{1}right) = 1 times 3 = 3 )( a_3 = a_2 left(1 + frac{2}{2}right) = 3 times 2 = 6 )( a_4 = a_3 left(1 + frac{2}{3}right) = 6 times frac{5}{3} = 10 )( a_5 = a_4 left(1 + frac{2}{4}right) = 10 times frac{3}{2} = 15 )Wait a second, these numbers look familiar. 1, 3, 6, 10, 15... These are triangular numbers! The nth triangular number is given by ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ). Let me check:For ( n = 1 ): ( frac{1 times 2}{2} = 1 ) ✔️For ( n = 2 ): ( frac{2 times 3}{2} = 3 ) ✔️For ( n = 3 ): ( frac{3 times 4}{2} = 6 ) ✔️For ( n = 4 ): ( frac{4 times 5}{2} = 10 ) ✔️For ( n = 5 ): ( frac{5 times 6}{2} = 15 ) ✔️So it seems like ( a_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ). If that's the case, then ( a_{999} = frac{999 times 1000}{2} ). Let me compute that:( frac{999 times 1000}{2} = frac{999000}{2} = 499500 )But wait, before I get too confident, I should verify this formula with the recurrence relation to make sure it holds for all ( n ).Assume that ( a_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ). Then, let's compute ( a_{n+1} ) using the recurrence:( a_{n+1} = a_n left(1 + frac{2}{n}right) = frac{n(n+1)}{2} times left(1 + frac{2}{n}right) )Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:( 1 + frac{2}{n} = frac{n + 2}{n} )So,( a_{n+1} = frac{n(n+1)}{2} times frac{n + 2}{n} )Simplify:The ( n ) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:( a_{n+1} = frac{(n+1)(n + 2)}{2} )Which is exactly the formula for ( a_{n+1} ). So, the formula holds for all ( n ). Therefore, my initial guess was correct.Hence, ( a_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ), so ( a_{999} = frac{999 times 1000}{2} = 499500 ).Just to make sure, let me test this with ( n = 5 ):( a_5 = frac{5 times 6}{2} = 15 ), which matches what I calculated earlier. Good.Another way to think about this is to express the recurrence relation as a product. Since each term is the previous term multiplied by ( 1 + frac{2}{n} ), starting from ( a_1 = 1 ), we can write:( a_n = a_1 times prod_{k=1}^{n-1} left(1 + frac{2}{k}right) )Let me compute this product:( prod_{k=1}^{n-1} left(1 + frac{2}{k}right) = prod_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{k + 2}{k} )This is a telescoping product. Let me write out the terms:For ( k = 1 ): ( frac{3}{1} )For ( k = 2 ): ( frac{4}{2} )For ( k = 3 ): ( frac{5}{3} )...For ( k = n-1 ): ( frac{n + 1}{n - 1} )Multiplying all these together:( frac{3}{1} times frac{4}{2} times frac{5}{3} times cdots times frac{n + 1}{n - 1} )Notice that in this product, the numerator of each fraction cancels with the denominator of the next fraction. Let's see:- The 3 in the numerator of the first term cancels with the 3 in the denominator of the third term.- The 4 in the numerator of the second term cancels with the 4 in the denominator of the fourth term.- This pattern continues, and most terms cancel out.What's left after cancellation? The denominators that don't get canceled are the first two denominators: 1 and 2. The numerators that don't get canceled are the last two numerators: ( n ) and ( n + 1 ).So, the product simplifies to:( frac{n(n + 1)}{1 times 2} = frac{n(n + 1)}{2} )Which is exactly the formula we had earlier. So, that confirms it.Therefore, ( a_n = frac{n(n + 1)}{2} ), so ( a_{999} = frac{999 times 1000}{2} = 499500 ).Just to recap, the key steps were:1. Recognize the recurrence relation as a multiplicative factor.2. Compute the first few terms to notice the pattern of triangular numbers.3. Verify the formula by induction or substitution into the recurrence.4. Alternatively, express the recurrence as a telescoping product and simplify.Both approaches led me to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.**Final Answer**The value of ( a_{999} ) is boxed{499500}."},{"question":"Now, select two people from A, B, C, and D to participate in an event.

The final two people to participate in the event are ( ).(A) A and B(B) B and C(C) A and C(D) B and D","answer":"Alright, so I have this logic problem here where I need to select two people out of A, B, C, and D to participate in an event. There are some rules given, and I need to figure out which pair is the correct one based on those rules. The options are (A) A and B, (B) B and C, (C) A and C, and (D) B and D. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me list out the rules to make sure I understand them correctly:1. If A goes, then B also goes.2. If C does not go, then B does not go.3. If C goes, then D does not go.So, these are three conditional statements that I need to consider when selecting the two participants. My goal is to find which pair among the options satisfies all these conditions without any contradictions.Let me start by analyzing each rule one by one and see how they interact.**Rule 1: If A goes, then B also goes.**This means that A cannot go alone; B must accompany A. So, if A is selected, B must be selected as well. Conversely, if A is not selected, there's no restriction on B from this rule. So, A implies B, but B can be selected without A.**Rule 2: If C does not go, then B does not go.**This is a bit trickier. It says that if C is not selected, then B cannot be selected. In logical terms, this is equivalent to saying that if B is selected, then C must also be selected. Because if the consequent is false (B does not go), then the antecedent must be false (C does not go). So, another way to look at it is: B implies C. So, if B is going, C must be going too.**Rule 3: If C goes, then D does not go.**This means that if C is selected, D cannot be selected. So, C and D cannot both go. If C is in, D is out, and vice versa.Now, let's see how these rules interact.From Rule 1 and Rule 2, we can derive some implications.If A is selected, then B must be selected (Rule 1). But if B is selected, then from Rule 2, C must be selected. So, if A is selected, then B and C must be selected. But wait, we can only select two people. So, if A is selected, we have to select B and C, but that's three people, which is more than allowed. Therefore, selecting A would require selecting three people, which is not possible because we need only two. Therefore, A cannot be selected.Wait, hold on. Let me think about that again. If A is selected, then B must be selected (Rule 1). If B is selected, then C must be selected (Rule 2). So, selecting A would require selecting B and C, which is three people, but we can only select two. Therefore, it's impossible to select A because it would require more than two people. So, A cannot be selected.Therefore, A is out. So, the two participants must be selected from B, C, and D.Now, let's look at the remaining options: B, C, D. We need to choose two.Let me consider each possible pair from B, C, D and see if they satisfy all the rules.**Option (A): A and B** - We already determined that A cannot be selected because selecting A would require selecting B and C, making three people. So, this option is invalid.**Option (B): B and C** - Let's check if this pair satisfies all the rules.1. If A goes, then B also goes. Since A is not going, this rule doesn't impose any restriction here.2. If C does not go, then B does not go. In this case, C is going, so the antecedent is false, so the implication is true regardless.3. If C goes, then D does not go. C is going, so D must not go. Since D is not in the selected pair, this is satisfied.So, Option (B) seems to satisfy all the rules.**Option (C): A and C** - Again, A is selected. As before, selecting A would require selecting B as well (Rule 1). So, we would have A, B, and C, which is three people. Therefore, this is invalid.**Option (D): B and D** - Let's check this pair.1. If A goes, then B also goes. A is not going, so no issue.2. If C does not go, then B does not go. In this case, C is not going, so according to this rule, B should not go. But in this pair, B is going. So, this violates Rule 2. Therefore, Option (D) is invalid.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that.In Option (D), we have B and D. So, C is not going. Rule 2 says if C does not go, then B does not go. So, since C is not going, B should not go. But in this pair, B is going, which contradicts Rule 2. Therefore, Option (D) is invalid.So, from the above analysis, the only valid option is Option (B): B and C.But just to make sure, let me go through each rule again with Option (B): B and C.1. If A goes, then B also goes. A is not going, so this rule is satisfied.2. If C does not go, then B does not go. Since C is going, the antecedent is false, so the implication is true. So, no problem here.3. If C goes, then D does not go. C is going, so D must not go. In our pair, D is not going, so this is satisfied.Yes, all rules are satisfied with Option (B).Just to recap:- A cannot be selected because selecting A would require selecting B and C, which is three people.- If we try to select B and D, it violates Rule 2 because if C is not going, B shouldn't go either.- Selecting A and C is invalid because it would require selecting B as well.- Therefore, the only valid pair is B and C.So, I think the correct answer is Option (B): B and C.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"I live in a five-story building with four entrances, with four apartments on each landing. What is the minimum number of questions you can ask to determine which apartment I live in, if I answer all your questions truthfully, but only with \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\"?","answer":"Okay, so I live in a five-story building with four entrances, and each landing has four apartments. I need to figure out the minimum number of yes/no questions required to determine exactly which apartment I live in. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the building structure. There are five floors, right? And on each floor, there are four entrances, each leading to an apartment. So, each floor has four apartments. That means the total number of apartments in the building is 5 floors multiplied by 4 apartments per floor, which is 20 apartments in total.Now, the goal is to determine which specific apartment I live in by asking the fewest number of yes/no questions. Each question can only be answered with a \\"yes\\" or \\"no,\\" so each question effectively splits the possibilities into two groups. This reminds me of binary search, where each question halves the number of possibilities.In information theory, the minimum number of yes/no questions needed to distinguish between N possibilities is given by the logarithm base 2 of N, rounded up to the nearest whole number. So, for 20 apartments, we can calculate the logarithm base 2 of 20.Let me compute that. Log base 2 of 20 is approximately 4.3219. Since we can't ask a fraction of a question, we round this up to the next whole number, which is 5. So, theoretically, 5 questions should be enough to determine the apartment.But wait, let me think if there's a way to structure the questions more efficiently. Maybe by categorizing the apartments in a way that each question narrows down the possibilities more effectively.Let's consider the structure of the building. There are five floors and four entrances per floor. So, one approach could be to first determine the floor, and then determine the entrance on that floor. Alternatively, we could mix the questions to cover both floor and entrance simultaneously.If we first ask about the floor, we can narrow down the possibilities from 20 to 4 apartments. Since there are five floors, determining the floor would require log2(5) ≈ 2.3219 questions, which we'd round up to 3 questions. Then, for the entrance, since there are four per floor, log2(4) = 2 questions. So, in total, that would be 3 + 2 = 5 questions. That matches the earlier calculation.Alternatively, if we don't separate floors and entrances, but instead ask questions that partition the apartments in a way that each question splits the remaining possibilities as evenly as possible, we might still end up with 5 questions. Let me test this.Suppose the first question is: \\"Is your apartment on one of the first three floors?\\" If the answer is yes, we have 15 apartments left; if no, we have 5 apartments left. Then, depending on the answer, we can adjust our next question accordingly.But wait, 15 apartments would require log2(15) ≈ 3.9069, so 4 more questions, totaling 5. If the answer was no, we have 5 apartments left, which would require log2(5) ≈ 2.3219, so 3 more questions, totaling 4. Hmm, interesting. So depending on the answers, sometimes it might take fewer questions. But since we need to guarantee the minimum number regardless of the answers, we have to consider the worst-case scenario, which would still require 5 questions.Another approach is to number the apartments from 1 to 20 and use binary representation. Each yes/no question corresponds to a bit in the binary number. Since 20 in binary is 10100, which is 5 bits long, we would need 5 questions to uniquely identify each apartment. Each question would correspond to a specific bit position, determining whether that bit is 0 or 1.For example, the first question could be: \\"Is the first bit of your apartment number 1?\\" If yes, that means the apartment number is in the range where the first bit is set, which would be apartments 16-20. Then, the next question could be about the second bit, and so on, until all five bits are determined.This method ensures that each question is optimally splitting the remaining possibilities, leading to the minimum number of questions required. So, regardless of how we structure the questions—whether by floor and entrance or by binary representation—it seems that 5 questions are necessary.But just to make sure, let me think if there's a way to do it in fewer than 5 questions. If we use 4 questions, the maximum number of distinguishable apartments would be 2^4 = 16. But since we have 20 apartments, 4 questions aren't enough because 16 < 20. Therefore, 5 questions are indeed necessary.So, putting it all together, whether we approach it by separating floors and entrances or by using binary representation, the minimum number of yes/no questions required to determine the exact apartment is 5.**Final Answer**The minimum number of questions needed is boxed{5}."},{"question":"A citrus grove has laid out their plans for their sixteen orchards for the growing season. Lemons, their most popular citrus fruit, will take up eight orchards. Oranges are their second most popular fruit and will occupy half as many orchards as the lemons. Limes and grapefruits will split the remaining orchards. How many citrus orchards will be growing grapefruits?","answer":"First, I note that there are a total of 16 citrus orchards.Lemons will occupy 8 of these orchards.Oranges will occupy half as many orchards as lemons, which is 8 divided by 2, resulting in 4 orchards for oranges.Adding the orchards for lemons and oranges gives a total of 12 orchards.This leaves 16 minus 12, which equals 4 orchards remaining for limes and grapefruits.Since limes and grapefruits will split these remaining orchards equally, each will get 2 orchards.Therefore, there will be 2 citrus orchards growing grapefruits."},{"question":"Determine all positive integers  n  such that    ncdot 2^{n-1}+1    is a perfect square.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that ( n cdot 2^{n-1} + 1 ) is a perfect square. Hmm, that sounds interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down the expression clearly: ( n cdot 2^{n-1} + 1 ). I need this to be a perfect square. So, I can denote this as ( k^2 ) where ( k ) is some positive integer. Therefore, the equation becomes:[ n cdot 2^{n-1} + 1 = k^2 ]My goal is to find all positive integers ( n ) that satisfy this equation.Let me start by testing small values of ( n ) to see if I can find any solutions.For ( n = 1 ):[ 1 cdot 2^{0} + 1 = 1 cdot 1 + 1 = 2 ]2 is not a perfect square. So, ( n = 1 ) is not a solution.For ( n = 2 ):[ 2 cdot 2^{1} + 1 = 2 cdot 2 + 1 = 5 ]5 is not a perfect square either. So, ( n = 2 ) is out.For ( n = 3 ):[ 3 cdot 2^{2} + 1 = 3 cdot 4 + 1 = 13 ]13 is not a perfect square. Moving on.For ( n = 4 ):[ 4 cdot 2^{3} + 1 = 4 cdot 8 + 1 = 33 ]33 isn't a perfect square. Hmm, not this one.For ( n = 5 ):[ 5 cdot 2^{4} + 1 = 5 cdot 16 + 1 = 81 ]81 is a perfect square because ( 9^2 = 81 ). So, ( n = 5 ) is a solution. That's good.Let me check ( n = 6 ):[ 6 cdot 2^{5} + 1 = 6 cdot 32 + 1 = 193 ]193 is not a perfect square. Next.( n = 7 ):[ 7 cdot 2^{6} + 1 = 7 cdot 64 + 1 = 449 ]449 is not a perfect square. I know that ( 21^2 = 441 ) and ( 22^2 = 484 ), so 449 is in between, not a square.( n = 8 ):[ 8 cdot 2^{7} + 1 = 8 cdot 128 + 1 = 1025 ]1025... Hmm, 32^2 is 1024, so 1025 is just one more than a perfect square. Not a square itself.( n = 9 ):[ 9 cdot 2^{8} + 1 = 9 cdot 256 + 1 = 2305 ]2305. Let me see, 48^2 is 2304, so 2305 is again one more than a perfect square. Not a square.( n = 10 ):[ 10 cdot 2^{9} + 1 = 10 cdot 512 + 1 = 5121 ]5121. What's the square around here? 71^2 is 5041, 72^2 is 5184. So, 5121 is between them, not a square.Hmm, so up to ( n = 10 ), only ( n = 5 ) works. Maybe I should check a few more.( n = 11 ):[ 11 cdot 2^{10} + 1 = 11 cdot 1024 + 1 = 11265 ]11265. Let's see, 106^2 is 11236, 107^2 is 11449. So, 11265 is in between, not a square.( n = 12 ):[ 12 cdot 2^{11} + 1 = 12 cdot 2048 + 1 = 24577 ]24577. 156^2 is 24336, 157^2 is 24649. So, 24577 is between them, not a square.( n = 13 ):[ 13 cdot 2^{12} + 1 = 13 cdot 4096 + 1 = 53249 ]53249. Let me see, 230^2 is 52900, 231^2 is 53361. So, 53249 is between them, not a square.( n = 14 ):[ 14 cdot 2^{13} + 1 = 14 cdot 8192 + 1 = 114689 ]114689. Hmm, 338^2 is 114244, 339^2 is 114921. So, 114689 is in between, not a square.( n = 15 ):[ 15 cdot 2^{14} + 1 = 15 cdot 16384 + 1 = 245761 ]245761. Let me check, 495^2 is 245025, 496^2 is 246016. So, 245761 is between them, not a square.Hmm, seems like up to ( n = 15 ), only ( n = 5 ) works. Maybe I should try to find a general approach rather than testing each ( n ).Let me write the equation again:[ n cdot 2^{n-1} + 1 = k^2 ]So, ( k^2 - n cdot 2^{n-1} = 1 ). This resembles a Pell equation, but it's not exactly the same because the coefficient of ( n ) is variable depending on ( n ).Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the equation:[ k^2 - 1 = n cdot 2^{n-1} ][ (k - 1)(k + 1) = n cdot 2^{n-1} ]Ah, that's interesting. So, the product of ( k - 1 ) and ( k + 1 ) is equal to ( n cdot 2^{n-1} ). Since ( k - 1 ) and ( k + 1 ) are two consecutive even numbers (because they differ by 2), their product is divisible by 4. Let me check:( k - 1 ) and ( k + 1 ) are two numbers differing by 2, so one of them is even, and the other is also even because they are two apart. So, both are even, meaning their product is divisible by 4. Therefore, ( n cdot 2^{n-1} ) must be divisible by 4.So, ( n cdot 2^{n-1} ) must be divisible by 4. Let's analyze when that happens.Case 1: If ( n ) is even, say ( n = 2m ), then ( 2^{n - 1} = 2^{2m - 1} ). So, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} = 2m cdot 2^{2m - 1} = m cdot 2^{2m} ). Since ( 2m ) is at least 2, ( 2^{2m} ) is at least 4, so the product is divisible by 4.Case 2: If ( n ) is odd, say ( n = 2m + 1 ), then ( 2^{n - 1} = 2^{2m} ). So, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} = (2m + 1) cdot 2^{2m} ). Here, ( 2^{2m} ) is divisible by 4 when ( m geq 1 ), which is true for ( n geq 3 ). For ( n = 1 ), it's 1 * 1 = 1, which isn't divisible by 4, but we already saw that ( n = 1 ) doesn't work.So, in both cases, except for ( n = 1 ), ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} ) is divisible by 4. Therefore, ( (k - 1)(k + 1) ) is divisible by 4, which is consistent.Now, since ( k - 1 ) and ( k + 1 ) are two consecutive even numbers, one of them is divisible by 2 and the other is divisible by 4. Because in two consecutive even numbers, one is a multiple of 4 and the other is just a multiple of 2. For example, 2 and 4: 2 is divisible by 2, 4 is divisible by 4. Similarly, 4 and 6: 4 is divisible by 4, 6 is divisible by 2. So, in general, one is divisible by 4, and the other is divisible by 2.Therefore, ( (k - 1)(k + 1) ) is divisible by 8. So, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} ) must be divisible by 8. Let's check when that happens.Again, let's consider cases:Case 1: ( n ) is even, ( n = 2m ). Then, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} = 2m cdot 2^{2m - 1} = m cdot 2^{2m} ). So, ( 2^{2m} ) is divisible by 4, but to be divisible by 8, ( 2m ) must be at least 4, which is when ( m geq 2 ), i.e., ( n geq 4 ).Case 2: ( n ) is odd, ( n = 2m + 1 ). Then, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} = (2m + 1) cdot 2^{2m} ). Here, ( 2^{2m} ) is divisible by 4, but to get divisibility by 8, ( 2^{2m} ) must be at least 8, which is when ( 2m geq 3 ), i.e., ( m geq 2 ), so ( n geq 5 ).So, for ( n geq 4 ) when even, and ( n geq 5 ) when odd, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} ) is divisible by 8. Therefore, ( (k - 1)(k + 1) ) is divisible by 8, which is consistent.Now, since ( (k - 1) ) and ( (k + 1) ) are coprime? Wait, no. Because they differ by 2, their greatest common divisor is either 1 or 2. Since both are even, their GCD is 2.Therefore, ( gcd(k - 1, k + 1) = 2 ).Therefore, in the equation ( (k - 1)(k + 1) = n cdot 2^{n - 1} ), the two factors ( k - 1 ) and ( k + 1 ) are coprime except for a factor of 2.Therefore, we can write ( k - 1 = 2^{a} cdot m ) and ( k + 1 = 2^{b} cdot n ), where ( a + b = n - 1 ), and ( m ) and ( n ) are coprime integers. Wait, maybe I need to adjust that.Wait, actually, since ( (k - 1) ) and ( (k + 1) ) are coprime except for a factor of 2, we can express them as ( 2^{a} cdot c ) and ( 2^{b} cdot d ), where ( c ) and ( d ) are coprime, and ( a + b = n - 1 ). Also, since ( k + 1 - (k - 1) = 2 ), the difference between ( 2^{a}c ) and ( 2^{b}d ) is 2.So, without loss of generality, let's assume ( a geq b ). Then, ( 2^{a}c - 2^{b}d = 2 ). Let me factor out ( 2^{b} ):( 2^{b}(2^{a - b}c - d) = 2 ).Since ( 2^{b} ) divides 2, ( b ) can be 0 or 1.Case 1: ( b = 0 ). Then, ( 2^{a - 0}c - d = 2 ). So, ( 2^{a}c - d = 2 ). Also, ( a + 0 = n - 1 ), so ( a = n - 1 ).But ( k - 1 = 2^{a}c = 2^{n - 1}c ), and ( k + 1 = d ). But ( k + 1 = d ) implies that ( d = k + 1 ), which is greater than ( k - 1 ), but ( 2^{n - 1}c ) is likely larger than ( d ) unless ( c ) is very small. Hmm, this might not be the right approach.Wait, maybe I should think differently. Since ( k - 1 ) and ( k + 1 ) are coprime except for a factor of 2, and their product is ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} ), which is ( n ) times a power of 2.Therefore, each of ( k - 1 ) and ( k + 1 ) must be of the form ( 2^{a} ) times something coprime to 2. Since their product is ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} ), and ( n ) is multiplied by a power of 2, perhaps one of them is a power of 2 and the other is ( n ) times another power of 2.Wait, let me think. Since ( k - 1 ) and ( k + 1 ) are coprime except for a factor of 2, and their product is ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} ), which is ( n ) times a power of 2, then one of them must be a multiple of ( n ) and the other must be a power of 2.But since ( n ) is a positive integer, and ( k - 1 ) and ( k + 1 ) are two apart, one of them is a power of 2 and the other is ( n ) times another power of 2.So, let's suppose that ( k - 1 = 2^{a} ) and ( k + 1 = n cdot 2^{b} ), where ( a + b = n - 1 ). Alternatively, it could be the other way around: ( k - 1 = n cdot 2^{a} ) and ( k + 1 = 2^{b} ), with ( a + b = n - 1 ).Let me explore both possibilities.First, suppose ( k - 1 = 2^{a} ) and ( k + 1 = n cdot 2^{b} ). Then, since ( k + 1 - (k - 1) = 2 ), we have:( n cdot 2^{b} - 2^{a} = 2 ).Also, since ( a + b = n - 1 ), we can write ( a = n - 1 - b ).Substituting into the equation:( n cdot 2^{b} - 2^{n - 1 - b} = 2 ).Let me denote ( c = b ). Then, the equation becomes:( n cdot 2^{c} - 2^{n - 1 - c} = 2 ).Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find integer solutions for ( c ) and ( n ).Alternatively, let's consider the other case where ( k - 1 = n cdot 2^{a} ) and ( k + 1 = 2^{b} ). Then, subtracting:( 2^{b} - n cdot 2^{a} = 2 ).And since ( a + b = n - 1 ), we have ( a = n - 1 - b ).Substituting:( 2^{b} - n cdot 2^{n - 1 - b} = 2 ).Again, similar structure.Perhaps it's better to consider specific small exponents.Let me try the first case: ( k - 1 = 2^{a} ) and ( k + 1 = n cdot 2^{b} ), with ( a + b = n - 1 ).So, ( k = 2^{a} + 1 ), and ( k + 1 = 2^{a} + 2 = n cdot 2^{b} ).Therefore, ( 2^{a} + 2 = n cdot 2^{b} ).Let me factor out 2:( 2(2^{a - 1} + 1) = n cdot 2^{b} ).So, ( n = frac{2(2^{a - 1} + 1)}{2^{b}} = frac{2^{a - 1} + 1}{2^{b - 1}} ).Since ( n ) must be an integer, ( 2^{b - 1} ) must divide ( 2^{a - 1} + 1 ).Let me denote ( d = b - 1 ), so ( 2^{d} ) divides ( 2^{a - 1} + 1 ).Note that ( 2^{a - 1} + 1 ) is an odd number because ( 2^{a - 1} ) is even when ( a - 1 geq 1 ), i.e., ( a geq 2 ), so adding 1 makes it odd. If ( a = 1 ), then ( 2^{0} + 1 = 2 ), which is even.Wait, so if ( a = 1 ), then ( 2^{a - 1} + 1 = 2^{0} + 1 = 2 ), which is even, so ( 2^{d} ) divides 2, so ( d leq 1 ).But let's see:Case 1: ( a = 1 ). Then, ( 2^{a - 1} + 1 = 2 ), so ( n = frac{2}{2^{d}} ). Since ( n ) must be an integer, ( d ) can be 0 or 1.If ( d = 0 ), then ( n = 2 / 1 = 2 ). Let's check if this works.If ( n = 2 ), then ( a + b = n - 1 = 1 ). Since ( d = b - 1 = 0 ), so ( b = 1 ). Then, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 1 ). So, ( k - 1 = 2^{1} = 2 ), so ( k = 3 ). Then, ( k + 1 = 4 = 2^{2} ). But according to our assumption, ( k + 1 = n cdot 2^{b} = 2 cdot 2^{1} = 4 ). So, that works. But wait, earlier when I tested ( n = 2 ), the expression was 5, which isn't a square. Wait, that's a contradiction.Wait, let's see: if ( n = 2 ), then ( k^2 = 2 cdot 2^{1} + 1 = 5 ). But according to this case, ( k = 3 ), so ( k^2 = 9 ). Wait, that's inconsistent. So, something's wrong here.Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is flawed. Let me re-examine.If ( k - 1 = 2^{a} ) and ( k + 1 = n cdot 2^{b} ), then ( k = 2^{a} + 1 ), so ( k + 1 = 2^{a} + 2 ). Therefore, ( 2^{a} + 2 = n cdot 2^{b} ). So, ( n = (2^{a} + 2)/2^{b} ).In the case where ( a = 1 ), ( n = (2 + 2)/2^{b} = 4 / 2^{b} ). So, ( b ) can be 1 or 2.If ( b = 1 ), ( n = 4 / 2 = 2 ). Then, ( a + b = 1 + 1 = 2 ), but ( n - 1 = 1 ). So, 2 ≠ 1, which is a problem.If ( b = 2 ), ( n = 4 / 4 = 1 ). Then, ( a + b = 1 + 2 = 3 ), but ( n - 1 = 0 ). So, 3 ≠ 0, which is also a problem.Therefore, ( a = 1 ) doesn't lead to a valid solution because ( a + b ) doesn't equal ( n - 1 ).Wait, so maybe ( a = 1 ) is not acceptable because it doesn't satisfy the equation ( a + b = n - 1 ). So, perhaps ( a geq 2 ).Let me try ( a = 2 ). Then, ( 2^{a - 1} + 1 = 2^{1} + 1 = 3 ). So, ( n = 3 / 2^{d} ). Since ( n ) must be integer, ( 2^{d} ) divides 3. But 3 is odd, so ( d = 0 ). Therefore, ( n = 3 / 1 = 3 ).Then, ( a + b = n - 1 = 2 ). Since ( a = 2 ), ( b = 0 ). But ( b = 0 ) implies ( d = b - 1 = -1 ), which is invalid because ( d geq 0 ). So, this is not acceptable.Hmm, maybe ( a = 3 ). Then, ( 2^{a - 1} + 1 = 2^{2} + 1 = 5 ). So, ( n = 5 / 2^{d} ). Since 5 is odd, ( d = 0 ), so ( n = 5 ).Then, ( a + b = n - 1 = 4 ). Since ( a = 3 ), ( b = 1 ). So, ( d = b - 1 = 0 ). That works because ( d = 0 ).So, let's check this solution. ( a = 3 ), ( b = 1 ), ( n = 5 ).Then, ( k - 1 = 2^{3} = 8 ), so ( k = 9 ). Then, ( k + 1 = 10 = 5 cdot 2^{1} = 10 ). That works. And indeed, when ( n = 5 ), the expression is ( 5 cdot 16 + 1 = 81 = 9^2 ). So, that's a valid solution.Let me try ( a = 4 ). Then, ( 2^{a - 1} + 1 = 2^{3} + 1 = 9 ). So, ( n = 9 / 2^{d} ). Since 9 is odd, ( d = 0 ), so ( n = 9 ).Then, ( a + b = n - 1 = 8 ). Since ( a = 4 ), ( b = 4 ). So, ( d = b - 1 = 3 ).Therefore, ( k - 1 = 2^{4} = 16 ), so ( k = 17 ). Then, ( k + 1 = 18 = 9 cdot 2^{4 - 1} = 9 cdot 8 = 72 ). Wait, that doesn't match. 18 ≠ 72. So, something's wrong here.Wait, no. Let me re-examine. If ( k + 1 = n cdot 2^{b} ), and ( n = 9 ), ( b = 4 ), then ( k + 1 = 9 cdot 16 = 144 ). But ( k - 1 = 16 ), so ( k = 17 ), which would make ( k + 1 = 18 ). But 18 ≠ 144. So, this is inconsistent. Therefore, ( a = 4 ) doesn't work.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back.We had ( n = (2^{a - 1} + 1)/2^{d} ), where ( d = b - 1 ). Then, ( a + b = n - 1 ).So, for ( a = 4 ), ( n = (8 + 1)/2^{d} = 9 / 2^{d} ). So, ( d = 0 ), ( n = 9 ). Then, ( a + b = 4 + b = 9 - 1 = 8 ). So, ( b = 4 ). Then, ( d = b - 1 = 3 ). So, ( n = 9 / 2^{3} = 9 / 8 ), which is not integer. Contradiction. So, ( a = 4 ) is invalid.Therefore, ( a = 4 ) doesn't work.Let me try ( a = 5 ). Then, ( 2^{a - 1} + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 ). So, ( n = 17 / 2^{d} ). Since 17 is odd, ( d = 0 ), so ( n = 17 ).Then, ( a + b = 17 - 1 = 16 ). Since ( a = 5 ), ( b = 11 ). Then, ( d = b - 1 = 10 ). So, ( n = 17 / 2^{10} ), which is not integer. So, invalid.Hmm, seems like as ( a ) increases, ( n ) becomes fractional. So, maybe the only solution in this case is ( a = 3 ), ( n = 5 ).Now, let's consider the other case where ( k - 1 = n cdot 2^{a} ) and ( k + 1 = 2^{b} ). Then, subtracting:( 2^{b} - n cdot 2^{a} = 2 ).And ( a + b = n - 1 ).So, similar to before, let's write ( k = 2^{b} - 1 ), so ( k - 1 = 2^{b} - 2 = n cdot 2^{a} ).Thus, ( 2^{b} - 2 = n cdot 2^{a} ).Factor out 2:( 2(2^{b - 1} - 1) = n cdot 2^{a} ).Therefore, ( n = frac{2(2^{b - 1} - 1)}{2^{a}} = frac{2^{b - 1} - 1}{2^{a - 1}} ).Since ( n ) must be an integer, ( 2^{a - 1} ) must divide ( 2^{b - 1} - 1 ).Let me denote ( c = a - 1 ), so ( 2^{c} ) divides ( 2^{b - 1} - 1 ).Note that ( 2^{b - 1} - 1 ) is an odd number because ( 2^{b - 1} ) is even when ( b - 1 geq 1 ), i.e., ( b geq 2 ), so subtracting 1 makes it odd. If ( b = 1 ), then ( 2^{0} - 1 = 0 ), which is even, but division by ( 2^{c} ) would require ( c = 0 ).Wait, let's see:Case 1: ( b = 1 ). Then, ( 2^{b - 1} - 1 = 0 ). So, ( n = 0 / 2^{c} = 0 ), which is invalid because ( n ) must be positive.Case 2: ( b = 2 ). Then, ( 2^{b - 1} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 ). So, ( n = 1 / 2^{c} ). Since ( n ) must be integer, ( c = 0 ). Therefore, ( a = c + 1 = 1 ).Then, ( a + b = 1 + 2 = 3 ). But ( n - 1 = 0 ). So, 3 ≠ 0. Contradiction.Case 3: ( b = 3 ). Then, ( 2^{b - 1} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 ). So, ( n = 3 / 2^{c} ). Since 3 is odd, ( c = 0 ). Therefore, ( a = 1 ).Then, ( a + b = 1 + 3 = 4 ). ( n - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 ). So, 4 ≠ 2. Contradiction.Case 4: ( b = 4 ). Then, ( 2^{b - 1} - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 ). So, ( n = 7 / 2^{c} ). Since 7 is odd, ( c = 0 ). Therefore, ( a = 1 ).Then, ( a + b = 1 + 4 = 5 ). ( n - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 ). So, 5 ≠ 6. Contradiction.Case 5: ( b = 5 ). Then, ( 2^{b - 1} - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15 ). So, ( n = 15 / 2^{c} ). Since 15 is odd, ( c = 0 ). Therefore, ( a = 1 ).Then, ( a + b = 1 + 5 = 6 ). ( n - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14 ). So, 6 ≠ 14. Contradiction.Hmm, seems like this case isn't working either. Let me try ( b = 6 ). Then, ( 2^{5} - 1 = 31 ). So, ( n = 31 / 2^{c} ). Since 31 is odd, ( c = 0 ). ( a = 1 ). Then, ( a + b = 1 + 6 = 7 ). ( n - 1 = 31 - 1 = 30 ). 7 ≠ 30. Not working.Wait, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think about the equation ( 2^{b} - n cdot 2^{a} = 2 ). Since ( a + b = n - 1 ), perhaps I can express ( n ) in terms of ( a ) and ( b ).Let me write ( n = a + b + 1 ). Then, substituting into the equation:( 2^{b} - (a + b + 1) cdot 2^{a} = 2 ).This seems complicated, but maybe for small ( a ) and ( b ), we can find solutions.Let me try ( a = 1 ). Then, ( n = 1 + b + 1 = b + 2 ).So, the equation becomes:( 2^{b} - (b + 2) cdot 2^{1} = 2 )( 2^{b} - 2(b + 2) = 2 )( 2^{b} - 2b - 4 = 2 )( 2^{b} - 2b = 6 )Let me test small ( b ):( b = 3 ): ( 8 - 6 = 2 ) ≠ 6( b = 4 ): ( 16 - 8 = 8 ) ≠ 6( b = 5 ): ( 32 - 10 = 22 ) ≠ 6( b = 2 ): ( 4 - 4 = 0 ) ≠ 6( b = 1 ): ( 2 - 2 = 0 ) ≠ 6No solution for ( a = 1 ).Try ( a = 2 ). Then, ( n = 2 + b + 1 = b + 3 ).Equation:( 2^{b} - (b + 3) cdot 2^{2} = 2 )( 2^{b} - 4(b + 3) = 2 )( 2^{b} - 4b - 12 = 2 )( 2^{b} - 4b = 14 )Test ( b ):( b = 4 ): ( 16 - 16 = 0 ) ≠ 14( b = 5 ): ( 32 - 20 = 12 ) ≠ 14( b = 6 ): ( 64 - 24 = 40 ) ≠ 14( b = 3 ): ( 8 - 12 = -4 ) ≠ 14( b = 2 ): ( 4 - 8 = -4 ) ≠ 14( b = 1 ): ( 2 - 4 = -2 ) ≠ 14No solution for ( a = 2 ).Try ( a = 3 ). Then, ( n = 3 + b + 1 = b + 4 ).Equation:( 2^{b} - (b + 4) cdot 2^{3} = 2 )( 2^{b} - 8(b + 4) = 2 )( 2^{b} - 8b - 32 = 2 )( 2^{b} - 8b = 34 )Test ( b ):( b = 5 ): ( 32 - 40 = -8 ) ≠ 34( b = 6 ): ( 64 - 48 = 16 ) ≠ 34( b = 7 ): ( 128 - 56 = 72 ) ≠ 34( b = 4 ): ( 16 - 32 = -16 ) ≠ 34( b = 3 ): ( 8 - 24 = -16 ) ≠ 34No solution.( a = 4 ). Then, ( n = 4 + b + 1 = b + 5 ).Equation:( 2^{b} - (b + 5) cdot 16 = 2 )( 2^{b} - 16b - 80 = 2 )( 2^{b} - 16b = 82 )Test ( b ):( b = 6 ): ( 64 - 96 = -32 ) ≠ 82( b = 7 ): ( 128 - 112 = 16 ) ≠ 82( b = 8 ): ( 256 - 128 = 128 ) ≠ 82( b = 5 ): ( 32 - 80 = -48 ) ≠ 82No solution.This seems like a dead end. Maybe this case doesn't yield any solutions.So, from both cases, the only solution we found was ( n = 5 ).But wait, earlier when I tested ( n = 5 ), it worked. Let me check if there are any other solutions for higher ( n ). Maybe ( n = 0 ) or something, but ( n ) must be positive integer, so ( n = 0 ) is invalid.Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach.Let me consider the equation ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 = k^2 ). Let me try to write it as:( k^2 - 1 = n cdot 2^{n - 1} )( (k - 1)(k + 1) = n cdot 2^{n - 1} )As before, since ( k - 1 ) and ( k + 1 ) are coprime except for a factor of 2, and their product is ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} ), one of them must be a power of 2, and the other must be ( n ) times another power of 2.We already considered the cases where ( k - 1 = 2^{a} ) and ( k + 1 = n cdot 2^{b} ), and vice versa. The only solution we found was ( n = 5 ).Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the equation modulo some number to find constraints on ( n ).Let me consider the equation modulo 3.Compute ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 mod 3 ).Note that ( 2^{n - 1} mod 3 ) cycles every 2:- If ( n - 1 ) is even, ( 2^{n - 1} equiv 1 mod 3 )- If ( n - 1 ) is odd, ( 2^{n - 1} equiv 2 mod 3 )So, depending on whether ( n ) is odd or even:If ( n ) is odd, ( n - 1 ) is even, so ( 2^{n - 1} equiv 1 mod 3 ). Therefore, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 equiv n cdot 1 + 1 mod 3 equiv (n + 1) mod 3 ).If ( n ) is even, ( n - 1 ) is odd, so ( 2^{n - 1} equiv 2 mod 3 ). Therefore, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 equiv n cdot 2 + 1 mod 3 equiv (2n + 1) mod 3 ).Now, since ( k^2 mod 3 ) can be either 0 or 1, because:- ( 0^2 equiv 0 mod 3 )- ( 1^2 equiv 1 mod 3 )- ( 2^2 equiv 1 mod 3 )Therefore, ( k^2 equiv 0 ) or ( 1 mod 3 ).So, let's analyze both cases.Case 1: ( n ) is odd.Then, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 equiv n + 1 mod 3 ). This must be congruent to 0 or 1.So, ( n + 1 equiv 0 ) or ( 1 mod 3 ).Therefore:- If ( n + 1 equiv 0 mod 3 ), then ( n equiv 2 mod 3 ).- If ( n + 1 equiv 1 mod 3 ), then ( n equiv 0 mod 3 ).But ( n ) is odd, so ( n equiv 1 ) or ( 2 mod 3 ). So, possible.Case 2: ( n ) is even.Then, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 equiv 2n + 1 mod 3 ). This must be 0 or 1.So:- If ( 2n + 1 equiv 0 mod 3 ), then ( 2n equiv -1 equiv 2 mod 3 ), so ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ).- If ( 2n + 1 equiv 1 mod 3 ), then ( 2n equiv 0 mod 3 ), so ( n equiv 0 mod 3 ).But ( n ) is even, so ( n equiv 0 ) or ( 2 mod 3 ).Wait, if ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ), but ( n ) is even, so ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ) and even. For example, ( n = 4 ): 4 mod 3 is 1, and 4 is even. Similarly, ( n = 10 ): 10 mod 3 is 1, even.Alternatively, ( n equiv 0 mod 3 ), which is possible for even ( n ), like ( n = 6, 12, ) etc.So, this doesn't eliminate any possibilities, just gives some constraints.Alternatively, let's consider modulo 4.Compute ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 mod 4 ).Note that ( 2^{n - 1} mod 4 ):- If ( n - 1 geq 2 ), i.e., ( n geq 3 ), then ( 2^{n - 1} equiv 0 mod 4 ).- If ( n - 1 = 1 ), i.e., ( n = 2 ), ( 2^{1} = 2 mod 4 ).- If ( n - 1 = 0 ), i.e., ( n = 1 ), ( 2^{0} = 1 mod 4 ).So:- For ( n = 1 ): ( 1 cdot 1 + 1 = 2 mod 4 ).- For ( n = 2 ): ( 2 cdot 2 + 1 = 5 equiv 1 mod 4 ).- For ( n geq 3 ): ( n cdot 0 + 1 = 1 mod 4 ).Now, ( k^2 mod 4 ) can be 0 or 1.So, for ( n = 1 ): ( 2 mod 4 ), which is not a square. So, invalid.For ( n = 2 ): ( 1 mod 4 ), which is a square. But earlier, ( n = 2 ) gives 5, which isn't a square. So, this is a contradiction? Wait, no. Because ( k^2 equiv 1 mod 4 ) is okay, but the actual value might not be a square. So, modulo 4 doesn't eliminate ( n = 2 ), but we saw that it doesn't work.For ( n geq 3 ): ( 1 mod 4 ), which is acceptable.So, modulo 4 doesn't give us much except confirming that ( n geq 3 ) can potentially work.Alternatively, let's consider modulo 5.Compute ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 mod 5 ).Note that ( 2^{n - 1} mod 5 ) cycles every 4:- ( 2^0 = 1 mod 5 )- ( 2^1 = 2 mod 5 )- ( 2^2 = 4 mod 5 )- ( 2^3 = 3 mod 5 )- ( 2^4 = 1 mod 5 ), and so on.So, depending on ( n - 1 mod 4 ), ( 2^{n - 1} ) cycles through 1, 2, 4, 3.Let me compute ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 mod 5 ) for different ( n ):But this might get too involved. Maybe instead, let's note that ( k^2 mod 5 ) can be 0, 1, or 4.So, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 equiv 0, 1, ) or ( 4 mod 5 ).This might help in some cases, but perhaps it's not the most straightforward approach.Alternatively, let's consider the growth rate of the function ( f(n) = n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 ). It grows exponentially, while ( k^2 ) grows quadratically. So, for large ( n ), ( f(n) ) will be much larger than any square. Therefore, there can only be a finite number of solutions.Given that we've tested up to ( n = 15 ) and only found ( n = 5 ), perhaps that's the only solution.But to be thorough, let me try ( n = 16 ):[ 16 cdot 2^{15} + 1 = 16 cdot 32768 + 1 = 524288 + 1 = 524289 ]Is this a square? Let me check the square root:( 724^2 = 524176 )( 725^2 = 525625 )So, 524289 is between them. Let me compute ( 724.5^2 ) approximately:But actually, 724^2 = 524176, so 524289 - 524176 = 113. So, 724^2 + 113 = 524289. Not a square.Similarly, ( n = 17 ):[ 17 cdot 2^{16} + 1 = 17 cdot 65536 + 1 = 1114112 + 1 = 1114113 ]Square root is approximately 1055.5, since ( 1055^2 = 1113025 ), ( 1056^2 = 1115136 ). So, 1114113 is between them, not a square.( n = 18 ):[ 18 cdot 2^{17} + 1 = 18 cdot 131072 + 1 = 2359296 + 1 = 2359297 ]Square root is approximately 1536, since ( 1536^2 = 2359296 ). So, 2359297 is one more than a square. Not a square.( n = 19 ):[ 19 cdot 2^{18} + 1 = 19 cdot 262144 + 1 = 4980736 + 1 = 4980737 ]Square root is approximately 2232, since ( 2232^2 = 4981824 ). So, 4980737 is less than that. ( 2231^2 = 4977361 ). So, 4980737 is between ( 2231^2 ) and ( 2232^2 ), not a square.( n = 20 ):[ 20 cdot 2^{19} + 1 = 20 cdot 524288 + 1 = 10485760 + 1 = 10485761 ]Square root is 3238, since ( 3238^2 = 10485524 ), and ( 3239^2 = 10489121 ). So, 10485761 is between them, not a square.Hmm, seems like as ( n ) increases, the expression grows too quickly to be a perfect square. So, perhaps ( n = 5 ) is the only solution.But to be thorough, let me try to see if there's a mathematical way to prove that ( n = 5 ) is the only solution.Let me consider the equation again:( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 = k^2 )Rearranged as:( k^2 - n cdot 2^{n - 1} = 1 )This resembles a form of the Pell equation, but with a variable coefficient. Pell equations are of the form ( x^2 - Dy^2 = 1 ), where ( D ) is a non-square positive integer. In our case, ( D = n cdot 2^{n - 1} ), which is variable depending on ( n ).However, Pell equations typically have infinitely many solutions for a fixed ( D ), but in our case, ( D ) changes with ( n ), so it's a different equation for each ( n ). Therefore, it's not straightforward to apply Pell equation theory here.Alternatively, perhaps we can bound ( k ) in terms of ( n ) and show that beyond a certain ( n ), the equation cannot hold.Let me note that ( k^2 = n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 ). So, ( k ) is approximately ( sqrt{n cdot 2^{n - 1}} ).Let me consider the ratio ( frac{k}{2^{(n - 1)/2}} ). Let me denote ( m = (n - 1)/2 ). Then, ( k approx sqrt{n} cdot 2^{m} ).But this might not be helpful.Alternatively, let me take logarithms.Taking natural logarithm on both sides:( ln(k^2) = ln(n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1) )( 2 ln k approx ln(n) + (n - 1)ln 2 )For large ( n ), the ( (n - 1)ln 2 ) term dominates, so ( ln k approx frac{(n - 1)ln 2}{2} ), which implies ( k approx 2^{(n - 1)/2} ).Therefore, ( k ) is roughly ( 2^{(n - 1)/2} ).But let's see, ( k^2 = n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 ), so ( k approx sqrt{n} cdot 2^{(n - 1)/2} ).Wait, that seems conflicting with the previous approximation. Maybe I need to think differently.Alternatively, let me consider the difference between consecutive squares.For large ( k ), the difference between ( (k + 1)^2 ) and ( k^2 ) is ( 2k + 1 ), which is approximately ( 2k ). So, the gap between consecutive squares grows linearly with ( k ).Meanwhile, ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} ) grows exponentially with ( n ). Therefore, for large ( n ), ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} ) will increase much faster than the gaps between consecutive squares, making it unlikely for ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 ) to be a perfect square.Therefore, it's plausible that only small ( n ) satisfy the equation.Since we've tested up to ( n = 20 ) and only found ( n = 5 ), and considering the growth rates, it's reasonable to conclude that ( n = 5 ) is the only solution.Thus, the only positive integer ( n ) such that ( n cdot 2^{n - 1} + 1 ) is a perfect square is ( n = 5 )."},{"question":"Find all integers  n  for which both  4n + 1  and  9n + 1  are perfect squares.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find all integers ( n ) such that both ( 4n + 1 ) and ( 9n + 1 ) are perfect squares. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's denote ( 4n + 1 = a^2 ) and ( 9n + 1 = b^2 ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are integers. So, we have two equations:1. ( 4n + 1 = a^2 )2. ( 9n + 1 = b^2 )My goal is to find all integer values of ( n ) that satisfy both equations. Maybe I can express ( n ) from both equations and set them equal to each other?From the first equation, solving for ( n ):( 4n = a^2 - 1 )( n = frac{a^2 - 1}{4} )Similarly, from the second equation:( 9n = b^2 - 1 )( n = frac{b^2 - 1}{9} )Since both expressions equal ( n ), I can set them equal to each other:( frac{a^2 - 1}{4} = frac{b^2 - 1}{9} )Let me cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators:( 9(a^2 - 1) = 4(b^2 - 1) )Expanding both sides:( 9a^2 - 9 = 4b^2 - 4 )Let me bring all terms to one side:( 9a^2 - 4b^2 - 5 = 0 )Hmm, this looks like a quadratic Diophantine equation. Maybe I can rearrange it to make it more manageable.Let me write it as:( 9a^2 - 4b^2 = 5 )I wonder if I can factor this or find some relationship between ( a ) and ( b ). Let's see.Alternatively, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's try to express ( b^2 ) in terms of ( a^2 ):From ( 9a^2 - 4b^2 = 5 ):( 4b^2 = 9a^2 - 5 )( b^2 = frac{9a^2 - 5}{4} )Since ( b^2 ) must be an integer, ( 9a^2 - 5 ) must be divisible by 4. So, ( 9a^2 equiv 5 mod 4 ).But 9 mod 4 is 1, so:( a^2 equiv 5 mod 4 )But 5 mod 4 is 1, so:( a^2 equiv 1 mod 4 )Which means ( a ) must be odd because squares modulo 4 are either 0 or 1, and since ( a^2 equiv 1 mod 4 ), ( a ) must be odd. Let me write ( a = 2k + 1 ) where ( k ) is an integer.Substituting ( a = 2k + 1 ) into ( a^2 ):( a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 )So, plugging back into the equation for ( n ):( n = frac{a^2 - 1}{4} = frac{4k^2 + 4k + 1 - 1}{4} = frac{4k^2 + 4k}{4} = k^2 + k )So, ( n = k^2 + k ). Hmm, that's a nice expression. Now, let's see if we can express ( b ) in terms of ( k ).From earlier, ( b^2 = frac{9a^2 - 5}{4} ). Let's substitute ( a = 2k + 1 ):( b^2 = frac{9(4k^2 + 4k + 1) - 5}{4} )Let me compute the numerator:( 9(4k^2 + 4k + 1) = 36k^2 + 36k + 9 )Subtract 5:( 36k^2 + 36k + 9 - 5 = 36k^2 + 36k + 4 )So,( b^2 = frac{36k^2 + 36k + 4}{4} = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 )Therefore, ( b^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ). So, ( b ) must be an integer such that ( b^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ).Hmm, so now I have ( b^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ). Let me see if I can write this as a square in terms of ( k ).Let me consider ( b = 3k + m ), where ( m ) is some integer to be determined. Let's square this:( b^2 = (3k + m)^2 = 9k^2 + 6mk + m^2 )Set this equal to ( 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ):( 9k^2 + 6mk + m^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 )Subtract ( 9k^2 ) from both sides:( 6mk + m^2 = 9k + 1 )Now, let's collect like terms:( (6m - 9)k + (m^2 - 1) = 0 )This equation must hold for all ( k ), so the coefficients of ( k ) and the constant term must both be zero.So, we have two equations:1. ( 6m - 9 = 0 )2. ( m^2 - 1 = 0 )From the first equation:( 6m = 9 )( m = frac{9}{6} = frac{3}{2} )But ( m ) must be an integer because ( b ) is an integer. So, ( m = frac{3}{2} ) is not an integer. Hmm, that suggests that my initial assumption of ( b = 3k + m ) might not be the right approach, or perhaps ( m ) isn't an integer. Maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the equation ( b^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ) as a quadratic in ( k ):( 9k^2 + 9k + (1 - b^2) = 0 )Let me treat this as a quadratic equation in ( k ). For ( k ) to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square.The discriminant ( D ) is:( D = 81 - 4 times 9 times (1 - b^2) )Simplify:( D = 81 - 36(1 - b^2) = 81 - 36 + 36b^2 = 45 + 36b^2 )So, ( D = 36b^2 + 45 ). For ( k ) to be integer, ( D ) must be a perfect square. Let me denote ( D = c^2 ), so:( 36b^2 + 45 = c^2 )Hmm, another Diophantine equation. Let me rearrange this:( c^2 - 36b^2 = 45 )This is a Pell-type equation. Maybe I can factor this or find solutions.Alternatively, let's factor out 9:( c^2 - 36b^2 = 45 )Divide both sides by 9:( left( frac{c}{3} right)^2 - 4b^2 = 5 )Let me set ( d = frac{c}{3} ), so ( d ) must be an integer because ( c ) is divisible by 3. Then:( d^2 - 4b^2 = 5 )So, now we have:( d^2 - 4b^2 = 5 )This is similar to the equation we had earlier. Let me see if I can find integer solutions ( d ) and ( b ) to this equation.Let me rearrange it:( d^2 = 4b^2 + 5 )So, ( d^2 ) is 5 more than a multiple of 4. Let's consider squares modulo 4. Squares modulo 4 can be 0 or 1.So, ( d^2 equiv 0 ) or ( 1 mod 4 ). Then, ( 4b^2 + 5 equiv 0 + 1 = 1 mod 4 ) or ( 4b^2 + 5 equiv 0 + 1 = 1 mod 4 ). So, ( d^2 equiv 1 mod 4 ), which implies ( d ) is odd.Let me set ( d = 2m + 1 ), where ( m ) is an integer. Then:( d^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 )So, plugging into ( d^2 = 4b^2 + 5 ):( 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 4b^2 + 5 )Subtract 5:( 4m^2 + 4m + 1 - 5 = 4b^2 )Simplify:( 4m^2 + 4m - 4 = 4b^2 )Divide both sides by 4:( m^2 + m - 1 = b^2 )So, now we have:( b^2 = m^2 + m - 1 )Hmm, so ( b^2 ) is equal to ( m^2 + m - 1 ). Let me rearrange this:( b^2 - m^2 - m + 1 = 0 )Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can write this as:( b^2 = m^2 + m - 1 )Let me consider this as a quadratic in ( m ):( m^2 + m - (b^2 + 1) = 0 )The discriminant of this quadratic equation in ( m ) must be a perfect square for ( m ) to be integer.Discriminant ( D = 1 + 4(b^2 + 1) = 1 + 4b^2 + 4 = 4b^2 + 5 )Wait, that's the same discriminant as before. Hmm, seems like I'm going in circles.Alternatively, maybe I can try small integer values for ( m ) and see if ( b^2 = m^2 + m - 1 ) is a perfect square.Let me try ( m = 0 ):( b^2 = 0 + 0 - 1 = -1 ). Not possible.( m = 1 ):( b^2 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1 ). So, ( b = pm1 ).( m = 2 ):( b^2 = 4 + 2 - 1 = 5 ). Not a square.( m = 3 ):( b^2 = 9 + 3 - 1 = 11 ). Not a square.( m = 4 ):( b^2 = 16 + 4 - 1 = 19 ). Not a square.( m = 5 ):( b^2 = 25 + 5 - 1 = 29 ). Not a square.( m = 6 ):( b^2 = 36 + 6 - 1 = 41 ). Not a square.( m = 7 ):( b^2 = 49 + 7 - 1 = 55 ). Not a square.( m = 8 ):( b^2 = 64 + 8 - 1 = 71 ). Not a square.( m = 9 ):( b^2 = 81 + 9 - 1 = 89 ). Not a square.( m = 10 ):( b^2 = 100 + 10 - 1 = 109 ). Not a square.Hmm, not promising. Let me try negative ( m ):( m = -1 ):( b^2 = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 ). Not possible.( m = -2 ):( b^2 = 4 - 2 - 1 = 1 ). So, ( b = pm1 ).( m = -3 ):( b^2 = 9 - 3 - 1 = 5 ). Not a square.( m = -4 ):( b^2 = 16 - 4 - 1 = 11 ). Not a square.( m = -5 ):( b^2 = 25 - 5 - 1 = 19 ). Not a square.Okay, so only ( m = 1 ) and ( m = -2 ) give us ( b^2 = 1 ). So, ( b = pm1 ).Let me check these cases.Case 1: ( m = 1 ), ( b = 1 )From earlier, ( d = 2m + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3 )Then, ( c = 3d = 3*3 = 9 )Wait, no, earlier I had ( d = frac{c}{3} ), so ( c = 3d ). So, if ( d = 3 ), then ( c = 9 ).Then, going back to the quadratic equation for ( k ):( 9k^2 + 9k + (1 - b^2) = 0 )With ( b = 1 ):( 9k^2 + 9k + (1 - 1) = 9k^2 + 9k = 0 )Factor:( 9k(k + 1) = 0 )So, ( k = 0 ) or ( k = -1 )So, let's find ( n ) for these ( k ).Recall ( n = k^2 + k )For ( k = 0 ):( n = 0 + 0 = 0 )For ( k = -1 ):( n = (-1)^2 + (-1) = 1 - 1 = 0 )So, both lead to ( n = 0 ). Let me check if this works.( 4n + 1 = 1 ), which is ( 1^2 ), and ( 9n + 1 = 1 ), which is also ( 1^2 ). So, yes, ( n = 0 ) is a solution.Case 2: ( m = -2 ), ( b = 1 )Wait, ( m = -2 ), so ( d = 2*(-2) + 1 = -4 + 1 = -3 ). Then, ( c = 3d = 3*(-3) = -9 ).Then, back to the quadratic equation for ( k ):( 9k^2 + 9k + (1 - b^2) = 0 )Again, ( b = 1 ):( 9k^2 + 9k = 0 ), same as before, leading to ( k = 0 ) or ( k = -1 ), so ( n = 0 ) again.So, only ( n = 0 ) comes up here.Wait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check if there are other solutions.Earlier, when I set ( d = 2m + 1 ), I assumed ( d ) is odd, which is correct because ( d^2 equiv 1 mod 4 ). But perhaps I need to explore other possibilities or maybe consider that Pell equation.Wait, going back to the equation ( d^2 - 4b^2 = 5 ). Maybe I can find more solutions beyond the trivial ones.Let me rearrange it as:( d^2 = 4b^2 + 5 )So, ( d ) must be greater than ( 2b ). Let me try small values of ( b ) and see if ( d ) is integer.( b = 0 ): ( d^2 = 0 + 5 = 5 ). Not a square.( b = 1 ): ( d^2 = 4 + 5 = 9 ). So, ( d = 3 ) or ( d = -3 ). We already considered this case.( b = 2 ): ( d^2 = 16 + 5 = 21 ). Not a square.( b = 3 ): ( d^2 = 36 + 5 = 41 ). Not a square.( b = 4 ): ( d^2 = 64 + 5 = 69 ). Not a square.( b = 5 ): ( d^2 = 100 + 5 = 105 ). Not a square.( b = 6 ): ( d^2 = 144 + 5 = 149 ). Not a square.( b = 7 ): ( d^2 = 196 + 5 = 201 ). Not a square.( b = 8 ): ( d^2 = 256 + 5 = 261 ). Not a square.( b = 9 ): ( d^2 = 324 + 5 = 329 ). Not a square.( b = 10 ): ( d^2 = 400 + 5 = 405 ). Not a square.Hmm, seems like only ( b = pm1 ) gives a solution. So, maybe ( n = 0 ) is the only solution?But wait, let me think again. Maybe I need to consider larger values or perhaps negative ( b ).Wait, ( b ) can be negative, but since ( b^2 ) is same for ( b ) and ( -b ), so it's symmetric. So, negative ( b ) won't give new solutions.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the equation ( d^2 - 4b^2 = 5 ) as a Pell equation. Pell equations usually have infinitely many solutions, but this one is non-homogeneous because of the 5.Wait, Pell equations are of the form ( x^2 - Dy^2 = N ). In this case, ( D = 4 ), ( N = 5 ). So, it's a Pell-type equation.The general solution can be found using continued fractions or other methods, but since 4 is a square, it's a bit different. Wait, actually, when ( D ) is a perfect square, the equation is not a Pell equation in the traditional sense because Pell equations require ( D ) to be non-square.So, in this case, since ( D = 4 ) is a square, the equation ( d^2 - 4b^2 = 5 ) can be rewritten as ( (d - 2b)(d + 2b) = 5 ).Ah, that's a good point. So, since 5 is a prime number, the possible factorizations are limited.So, ( (d - 2b)(d + 2b) = 5 ). Since 5 is prime, the possible pairs of integers multiplying to 5 are:1. ( 1 times 5 )2. ( (-1) times (-5) )3. ( 5 times 1 )4. ( (-5) times (-1) )Let me consider each case.Case 1: ( d - 2b = 1 ) and ( d + 2b = 5 )Adding both equations:( 2d = 6 ) => ( d = 3 )Subtracting the first equation from the second:( 4b = 4 ) => ( b = 1 )So, ( d = 3 ), ( b = 1 ). We already considered this.Case 2: ( d - 2b = -1 ) and ( d + 2b = -5 )Adding both equations:( 2d = -6 ) => ( d = -3 )Subtracting the first equation from the second:( 4b = -4 ) => ( b = -1 )So, ( d = -3 ), ( b = -1 ). Again, same as before.Case 3: ( d - 2b = 5 ) and ( d + 2b = 1 )Adding both equations:( 2d = 6 ) => ( d = 3 )Subtracting the first equation from the second:( 4b = -4 ) => ( b = -1 )Same as above.Case 4: ( d - 2b = -5 ) and ( d + 2b = -1 )Adding both equations:( 2d = -6 ) => ( d = -3 )Subtracting the first equation from the second:( 4b = 4 ) => ( b = 1 )Same as above.So, all factorizations lead to ( d = pm3 ) and ( b = pm1 ). Therefore, the only solutions for ( d ) and ( b ) are these, which in turn lead to ( n = 0 ).Wait, but is ( n = 0 ) the only solution? Let me test ( n = 0 ):( 4(0) + 1 = 1 = 1^2 )( 9(0) + 1 = 1 = 1^2 )Yes, that works.But wait, maybe there are other solutions where ( n ) is negative? Let me check.Suppose ( n ) is negative. Let's say ( n = -k ), where ( k ) is a positive integer.Then, ( 4n + 1 = -4k + 1 ). For this to be a perfect square, ( -4k + 1 ) must be non-negative, so ( -4k + 1 geq 0 ) => ( k leq frac{1}{4} ). Since ( k ) is positive integer, ( k = 0 ), which gives ( n = 0 ). So, no negative ( n ) can satisfy ( 4n + 1 ) being a perfect square except ( n = 0 ).Alternatively, maybe ( n ) can be positive. Let me test ( n = 2 ):( 4(2) + 1 = 9 = 3^2 )( 9(2) + 1 = 19 ). Not a square.( n = 1 ):( 4(1) + 1 = 5 ). Not a square.( n = 3 ):( 4(3) + 1 = 13 ). Not a square.( n = 4 ):( 4(4) + 1 = 17 ). Not a square.( n = 5 ):( 4(5) + 1 = 21 ). Not a square.( n = 6 ):( 4(6) + 1 = 25 = 5^2 )( 9(6) + 1 = 55 ). Not a square.( n = 7 ):( 4(7) + 1 = 29 ). Not a square.( n = 8 ):( 4(8) + 1 = 33 ). Not a square.( n = 9 ):( 4(9) + 1 = 37 ). Not a square.( n = 10 ):( 4(10) + 1 = 41 ). Not a square.Hmm, so up to ( n = 10 ), only ( n = 0 ) and ( n = 6 ) give ( 4n + 1 ) as a square, but ( 9n + 1 ) isn't a square in those cases except for ( n = 0 ).Wait, let me check ( n = 6 ):( 4(6) + 1 = 25 = 5^2 )( 9(6) + 1 = 55 ). Not a square.So, no luck there.Wait, maybe I need to look for larger ( n ). Let me try ( n = 20 ):( 4(20) + 1 = 81 = 9^2 )( 9(20) + 1 = 181 ). Not a square.( n = 40 ):( 4(40) + 1 = 161 ). Not a square.( n = 50 ):( 4(50) + 1 = 201 ). Not a square.( n = 11 ):( 4(11) + 1 = 45 ). Not a square.Wait, maybe I need a different approach. Since we've reduced the problem to ( n = k^2 + k ), and ( b^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ), perhaps I can consider this as an equation in ( k ) and ( b ).Let me write it as:( b^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 )Let me rearrange this:( b^2 = (3k)^2 + 3*(3k) + 1 )Wait, that might not help. Alternatively, let me complete the square for the quadratic in ( k ):( b^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 )Factor out 9:( b^2 = 9left(k^2 + kright) + 1 )Complete the square inside the parentheses:( k^2 + k = left(k + frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{1}{4} )So,( b^2 = 9left(left(k + frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{1}{4}right) + 1 )Simplify:( b^2 = 9left(k + frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{9}{4} + 1 )( b^2 = 9left(k + frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{5}{4} )Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:( 4b^2 = 36left(k + frac{1}{2}right)^2 - 5 )Let me set ( m = 2k + 1 ), so ( k = frac{m - 1}{2} ). Then,( 4b^2 = 36left(frac{m - 1}{2} + frac{1}{2}right)^2 - 5 )Simplify inside the square:( frac{m - 1}{2} + frac{1}{2} = frac{m}{2} )So,( 4b^2 = 36left(frac{m}{2}right)^2 - 5 )Simplify:( 4b^2 = 36 times frac{m^2}{4} - 5 )( 4b^2 = 9m^2 - 5 )Multiply both sides by 4:( 16b^2 = 36m^2 - 20 )Wait, not sure if this helps. Alternatively, let's go back to the equation:( 4b^2 = 9m^2 - 5 )Wait, that's similar to the equation we had earlier. Let me rearrange:( 9m^2 - 4b^2 = 5 )Which is the same as before. So, we're back to the same equation.So, perhaps the only solution is ( n = 0 ). But let me think again.Wait, maybe I can consider that ( b^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ). Let me see if this can be expressed as a square.Let me write ( b = 3k + t ), where ( t ) is some integer. Then,( b^2 = (3k + t)^2 = 9k^2 + 6tk + t^2 )Set this equal to ( 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ):( 9k^2 + 6tk + t^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 )Subtract ( 9k^2 ):( 6tk + t^2 = 9k + 1 )Rearrange:( (6t - 9)k + (t^2 - 1) = 0 )For this to hold for all ( k ), coefficients must be zero:1. ( 6t - 9 = 0 ) => ( t = frac{9}{6} = frac{3}{2} )2. ( t^2 - 1 = 0 ) => ( t = pm1 )But ( t = frac{3}{2} ) is not an integer, and ( t = pm1 ) don't satisfy ( 6t - 9 = 0 ). So, no solution here.Alternatively, maybe ( t ) is not an integer? But ( b ) must be integer, so ( t ) must be integer.Therefore, this approach doesn't yield any new solutions.Wait, maybe I can consider the equation ( b^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ) as a quadratic in ( k ):( 9k^2 + 9k + (1 - b^2) = 0 )The discriminant must be a perfect square:( D = 81 - 4*9*(1 - b^2) = 81 - 36 + 36b^2 = 45 + 36b^2 )So, ( D = 36b^2 + 45 ) must be a perfect square. Let me denote ( D = c^2 ), so:( c^2 = 36b^2 + 45 )Divide both sides by 9:( left(frac{c}{3}right)^2 = 4b^2 + 5 )Let ( d = frac{c}{3} ), so:( d^2 = 4b^2 + 5 )Which brings us back to the same equation as before. So, again, we see that the only integer solutions are ( b = pm1 ) and ( d = pm3 ), leading to ( n = 0 ).Therefore, after exploring multiple approaches and checking possible cases, it seems that the only integer ( n ) satisfying both ( 4n + 1 ) and ( 9n + 1 ) being perfect squares is ( n = 0 ).But wait, just to be thorough, let me check ( n = 40 ):( 4*40 + 1 = 161 ). Not a square.( n = 21 ):( 4*21 + 1 = 85 ). Not a square.( n = 40 ):As above.Wait, maybe I need to check ( n = 20 ):( 4*20 + 1 = 81 = 9^2 )( 9*20 + 1 = 181 ). Not a square.Hmm, so no luck there.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that ( 4n + 1 ) and ( 9n + 1 ) being squares implies that ( n ) must satisfy some proportional relationship.Let me denote ( 4n + 1 = a^2 ) and ( 9n + 1 = b^2 ). Then, subtracting the two equations:( 9n + 1 - (4n + 1) = b^2 - a^2 )Simplify:( 5n = (b - a)(b + a) )So, ( 5n = (b - a)(b + a) )Since 5 is prime, the factors ( (b - a) ) and ( (b + a) ) must be such that one is a multiple of 5 and the other is a multiple of 1, or both are multiples of 5.But since ( b ) and ( a ) are integers, ( b - a ) and ( b + a ) must both be integers, and their product is ( 5n ).Let me consider the possible factor pairs of ( 5n ):1. ( 1 times 5n )2. ( 5 times n )3. ( (-1) times (-5n) )4. ( (-5) times (-n) )But since ( b + a > b - a ) (assuming ( b > a )), we can focus on positive factors.Case 1: ( b - a = 1 ), ( b + a = 5n )Adding both equations:( 2b = 5n + 1 ) => ( b = frac{5n + 1}{2} )Subtracting the first equation from the second:( 2a = 5n - 1 ) => ( a = frac{5n - 1}{2} )Since ( a ) and ( b ) must be integers, ( 5n + 1 ) and ( 5n - 1 ) must be even. So, ( 5n ) must be odd, which implies ( n ) is odd.Let me denote ( n = 2k + 1 ), where ( k ) is integer.Then,( a = frac{5(2k + 1) - 1}{2} = frac{10k + 5 - 1}{2} = frac{10k + 4}{2} = 5k + 2 )( b = frac{5(2k + 1) + 1}{2} = frac{10k + 5 + 1}{2} = frac{10k + 6}{2} = 5k + 3 )So, ( a = 5k + 2 ), ( b = 5k + 3 )Now, recall that ( 4n + 1 = a^2 ). Let's plug ( n = 2k + 1 ) and ( a = 5k + 2 ):( 4(2k + 1) + 1 = (5k + 2)^2 )Simplify left side:( 8k + 4 + 1 = 8k + 5 )Right side:( 25k^2 + 20k + 4 )Set equal:( 8k + 5 = 25k^2 + 20k + 4 )Bring all terms to one side:( 25k^2 + 12k - 1 = 0 )Solve this quadratic equation for ( k ):Discriminant ( D = 144 + 100 = 244 )Square root of 244 is not integer, so no integer solutions here.Case 2: ( b - a = 5 ), ( b + a = n )Adding both equations:( 2b = n + 5 ) => ( b = frac{n + 5}{2} )Subtracting:( 2a = n - 5 ) => ( a = frac{n - 5}{2} )Again, ( n ) must be such that ( n + 5 ) and ( n - 5 ) are even, so ( n ) must be odd.Let ( n = 2k + 1 ):( a = frac{2k + 1 - 5}{2} = frac{2k - 4}{2} = k - 2 )( b = frac{2k + 1 + 5}{2} = frac{2k + 6}{2} = k + 3 )Now, plug into ( 4n + 1 = a^2 ):( 4(2k + 1) + 1 = (k - 2)^2 )Simplify left side:( 8k + 4 + 1 = 8k + 5 )Right side:( k^2 - 4k + 4 )Set equal:( 8k + 5 = k^2 - 4k + 4 )Bring all terms to one side:( k^2 - 12k - 1 = 0 )Discriminant ( D = 144 + 4 = 148 ), which is not a perfect square. So, no integer solutions here.Case 3: ( b - a = n ), ( b + a = 5 )Adding:( 2b = n + 5 ) => ( b = frac{n + 5}{2} )Subtracting:( 2a = 5 - n ) => ( a = frac{5 - n}{2} )Again, ( n ) must be odd for ( a ) and ( b ) to be integers.Let ( n = 2k + 1 ):( a = frac{5 - (2k + 1)}{2} = frac{4 - 2k}{2} = 2 - k )( b = frac{2k + 1 + 5}{2} = frac{2k + 6}{2} = k + 3 )Plug into ( 4n + 1 = a^2 ):( 4(2k + 1) + 1 = (2 - k)^2 )Simplify left side:( 8k + 4 + 1 = 8k + 5 )Right side:( 4 - 4k + k^2 )Set equal:( 8k + 5 = k^2 - 4k + 4 )Bring all terms to one side:( k^2 - 12k - 1 = 0 )Same as before, discriminant is 148, not a perfect square. No solutions.Case 4: ( b - a = -1 ), ( b + a = -5n )This would lead to negative values, but since ( b ) and ( a ) are squares, they are non-negative, so ( b + a ) must be positive. So, this case is not possible.Similarly, other negative factor pairs would lead to negative ( b ) or ( a ), which isn't possible since squares are non-negative.Therefore, all possible factor pairs have been considered, and the only solution is ( n = 0 ).Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me check ( n = 0 ):( 4(0) + 1 = 1 = 1^2 )( 9(0) + 1 = 1 = 1^2 )Yes, both are perfect squares.Is there any other ( n ) that could satisfy this? From all the cases above, it seems not. Therefore, the only integer ( n ) is 0.**Final Answer**The only integer ( n ) is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Find the one-millionth digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of the fraction (3 / 41).","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the one-millionth digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of the fraction 3/41. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I remember that when you divide a number by another, especially when the denominator isn't a power of 10, the decimal can either terminate or repeat. Since 41 is a prime number and doesn't divide into 10 nicely, I think 3/41 is going to be a repeating decimal. So, the decimal expansion of 3/41 will have a repeating cycle. My goal is to figure out the length of that cycle and then determine where the one-millionth digit falls within that cycle.Alright, let's start by actually performing the division of 3 by 41 to see what the decimal looks like. Maybe writing it out will help me see the pattern.So, 3 divided by 41. Since 41 goes into 3 zero times, we write 0. and then proceed with the division. Multiply 3 by 10 to get 30. 41 goes into 30 zero times, so we write another 0. Multiply 30 by 10 to get 300. Now, how many times does 41 go into 300?Let me calculate that. 41 times 7 is 287, and 41 times 8 is 328. Since 328 is too big, it goes in 7 times. So, 7 times 41 is 287. Subtract that from 300, and we get 13. Bring down another 0 to make it 130.Now, how many times does 41 go into 130? Let's see, 41 times 3 is 123, and 41 times 4 is 164. So, 3 times. 3 times 41 is 123. Subtract that from 130, and we get 7. Bring down another 0 to make it 70.41 goes into 70 once because 41 times 1 is 41. Subtract that from 70, we get 29. Bring down another 0 to make it 290.41 times 7 is 287, which is less than 290. 41 times 7 is 287. Subtract that from 290, we get 3. Bring down another 0 to make it 30.Wait a minute, we've seen this before. After subtracting 287 from 290, we got 3, and then bringing down a 0 gives us 30. That was our starting point after the decimal. So, this means the decimal repeats from here.So, putting it all together, the decimal expansion of 3/41 is 0.0731707317..., where \\"07317\\" repeats indefinitely. Let me confirm that by writing out the decimals:- 3 divided by 41 is 0.- 30 divided by 41 is 0.0- 300 divided by 41 is 0.07- 130 divided by 41 is 0.073- 70 divided by 41 is 0.0731- 290 divided by 41 is 0.07317- Then back to 30, so it repeats.So, the repeating cycle is \\"07317\\", which is 5 digits long. Therefore, the decimal expansion is 0.(07317), repeating every 5 digits.Now, since the cycle is 5 digits long, to find the one-millionth digit, I need to figure out where the one-millionth position falls within these cycles. In other words, I need to determine the remainder when 1,000,000 is divided by 5. That will tell me the position within the cycle.Let me calculate 1,000,000 divided by 5. Well, 5 goes into 1,000,000 exactly 200,000 times with no remainder. Wait, that can't be right. If 5 times 200,000 is 1,000,000, then the remainder is 0. Hmm, so that would mean that the one-millionth digit is the last digit of the cycle.But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When dealing with remainders, if the remainder is 0, that means it's the last digit of the cycle. So, in this case, since the cycle is 5 digits, the 5th digit is the last one before it repeats again.Looking back at the cycle \\"07317\\", the digits are:1st digit: 02nd digit: 73rd digit: 34th digit: 15th digit: 7So, the 5th digit is 7. Therefore, the one-millionth digit, which is the last digit of the cycle, should be 7.Wait, but let me double-check my division to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Maybe I miscounted the cycle length.Starting from the decimal expansion:3/41 = 0.073170731707317...So, the repeating part is \\"07317\\", which is 5 digits. So, yes, the cycle length is 5.So, 1,000,000 divided by 5 is 200,000 with a remainder of 0. So, the one-millionth digit corresponds to the 5th digit in the cycle, which is 7.Therefore, the one-millionth digit after the decimal point in 3/41 is 7.But just to be thorough, let me think about another way to approach this. Maybe using modular arithmetic or some properties of repeating decimals.I remember that for a fraction a/b, the length of the repeating cycle is equal to the order of 10 modulo b, provided that b is coprime to 10. Since 41 is a prime number and doesn't divide 2 or 5, it is coprime to 10. Therefore, the length of the repeating cycle should be the smallest positive integer k such that 10^k ≡ 1 mod 41.So, let's compute the order of 10 modulo 41. That is, find the smallest k where 10^k ≡ 1 mod 41.We can compute powers of 10 modulo 41 until we get back to 1.Compute 10^1 mod 41 = 1010^2 = 100 mod 41. 41*2=82, 100-82=18. So, 10^2 ≡ 18 mod 41.10^3 = 10^2 * 10 = 18*10=180 mod 41. 41*4=164, 180-164=16. So, 10^3 ≡16 mod41.10^4=10^3*10=16*10=160 mod41. 41*3=123, 160-123=37. So, 10^4≡37 mod41.10^5=10^4*10=37*10=370 mod41. 41*9=369, 370-369=1. So, 10^5≡1 mod41.Ah, so the order of 10 modulo 41 is 5. That means the repeating cycle is indeed 5 digits long, which matches our earlier division result.Therefore, the cycle length is 5, so the decimal repeats every 5 digits. So, to find the one-millionth digit, we can compute 1,000,000 mod 5. Since 1,000,000 divided by 5 is 200,000 with remainder 0, that means the one-millionth digit is the last digit of the cycle.Looking back at the cycle, which is \\"07317\\", the digits are:Position 1: 0Position 2: 7Position 3: 3Position 4: 1Position 5: 7So, the 5th digit is 7. Therefore, the one-millionth digit is 7.Just to make sure, let me think about how the digits are arranged. The decimal expansion is 0.073170731707317..., so the first few digits after the decimal are:1: 02: 73: 34: 15: 76: 07: 78: 39: 110:711:012:713:314:115:7And so on.So, every 5 digits, it repeats. So, digit 5 is 7, digit 10 is 7, digit 15 is 7, etc. So, every multiple of 5, the digit is 7. Therefore, digit 1,000,000, which is a multiple of 5, is 7.So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, if I think about the positions:If I number the digits starting from 1, then the cycle is positions 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, etc.So, for any position n, the digit is determined by n mod 5. If n mod 5 is 1, it's 0; if 2, it's 7; if 3, it's 3; if 4, it's 1; if 0 (i.e., multiple of 5), it's 7.Therefore, since 1,000,000 mod 5 is 0, the digit is 7.Therefore, I can confidently say that the one-millionth digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of 3/41 is 7.**Final Answer**The one-millionth digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of ( frac{3}{41} ) is boxed{7}."},{"question":"Given the power function f(x)=x^{alpha} passes through the point (sqrt{2},2), then f(9)= ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: a power function f(x) = x^α passes through the point (√2, 2), and I need to find f(9). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that a power function is generally of the form f(x) = x^α, where α is a constant exponent. The problem gives me a specific point that this function passes through, which is (√2, 2). That means when x is √2, the function's value f(x) is 2. So, I can plug these values into the function to find α.Let me write that down:f(√2) = (√2)^α = 2.So, I have the equation (√2)^α = 2. I need to solve for α. Hmm, how do I solve for an exponent? Maybe I can take logarithms on both sides? Or perhaps express both sides with the same base.Wait, √2 is the same as 2^(1/2). So, I can rewrite (√2)^α as (2^(1/2))^α. Using the exponent rule (a^b)^c = a^(b*c), this becomes 2^(α/2). So, the equation becomes:2^(α/2) = 2.Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other:α/2 = 1.Solving for α, I multiply both sides by 2:α = 2.Okay, so the exponent α is 2. That means the function is f(x) = x^2.Now, the question asks for f(9). So, I just need to plug x = 9 into the function:f(9) = 9^2.Calculating that, 9 squared is 81. So, f(9) should be 81.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning, f(x) = x^α passes through (√2, 2). So, plugging in x = √2, f(x) = 2. That gives (√2)^α = 2. Expressing √2 as 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^α = 2^(α/2) = 2^1. Therefore, α/2 = 1, so α = 2. Then f(x) = x^2, so f(9) = 81. Yep, that seems right.Alternatively, I can think about it without logarithms. Since (√2)^α = 2, and √2 is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^α = 2^(α/2). So, 2^(α/2) = 2^1, so α/2 = 1, so α = 2. Same result.Another way to think about it: if I have (√2)^α = 2, then since √2 is approximately 1.414, and 1.414 squared is 2. So, if α is 2, then (√2)^2 = 2, which is correct. So, that checks out.Therefore, f(x) = x^2, and f(9) is 9 squared, which is 81. I think that's solid.Just to recap:1. Given f(x) = x^α passes through (√2, 2).2. Plug in x = √2 and f(x) = 2: (√2)^α = 2.3. Express √2 as 2^(1/2): (2^(1/2))^α = 2.4. Simplify exponent: 2^(α/2) = 2^1.5. Set exponents equal: α/2 = 1 => α = 2.6. Thus, f(x) = x^2.7. Compute f(9): 9^2 = 81.Everything seems to add up. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The key was recognizing that √2 is 2^(1/2), which allows me to rewrite the equation with the same base and solve for α. Once I have α, plugging in 9 is straightforward.I guess another way to see it is, if I didn't remember exponent rules, I could take logarithms. Let me try that approach just for thoroughness.Starting with (√2)^α = 2.Take natural log on both sides:ln((√2)^α) = ln(2).Using the logarithm power rule, ln(a^b) = b*ln(a):α * ln(√2) = ln(2).So, α = ln(2) / ln(√2).But ln(√2) is equal to ln(2^(1/2)) = (1/2)ln(2). So,α = ln(2) / ( (1/2)ln(2) ) = (ln(2)) / (0.5 ln(2)) = 2.Same result. So, whether I use exponent rules or logarithms, I get α = 2. Therefore, f(x) = x^2, and f(9) = 81. Yep, that's consistent.I think I've covered all the bases here. I don't see any alternative interpretations of the problem that would lead to a different answer. The function is clearly a power function, so it's of the form x^α, and the point given uniquely determines α. Then, evaluating at 9 is straightforward.So, I feel confident that the answer is 81.**Final Answer**The value of ( f(9) ) is boxed{81}."},{"question":"For which integer value of ( p ) do the equations ( 3x^2 - 4x + p - 2 = 0 ) and ( x^2 - 2px + 5 = 0 ) have a common root? Find this root.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the integer value of ( p ) such that the two quadratic equations ( 3x^2 - 4x + p - 2 = 0 ) and ( x^2 - 2px + 5 = 0 ) have a common root. Then, I also need to find that common root. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that if two quadratic equations have a common root, then that root must satisfy both equations simultaneously. So, let's denote the common root as ( alpha ). That means ( alpha ) must satisfy both equations:1. ( 3alpha^2 - 4alpha + p - 2 = 0 )2. ( alpha^2 - 2palpha + 5 = 0 )Okay, so I have two equations with two variables: ( alpha ) and ( p ). Maybe I can solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other. Let me try that.Looking at the second equation, it seems simpler, so I'll solve for ( p ) in terms of ( alpha ). Let's rearrange the second equation:( alpha^2 - 2palpha + 5 = 0 )Subtract ( alpha^2 ) and 5 from both sides:( -2palpha = -alpha^2 - 5 )Divide both sides by ( -2alpha ) (assuming ( alpha neq 0 ), which I should check later):( p = frac{alpha^2 + 5}{2alpha} )Alright, so ( p ) is expressed in terms of ( alpha ). Now, let's substitute this expression for ( p ) into the first equation.The first equation is:( 3alpha^2 - 4alpha + p - 2 = 0 )Substituting ( p ):( 3alpha^2 - 4alpha + left( frac{alpha^2 + 5}{2alpha} right) - 2 = 0 )Hmm, this looks a bit messy, but let's try to simplify it step by step.First, let me write all the terms:( 3alpha^2 - 4alpha + frac{alpha^2 + 5}{2alpha} - 2 = 0 )To combine these terms, I need a common denominator. The denominators here are 1 and ( 2alpha ). So, let's multiply each term by ( 2alpha ) to eliminate the denominator:( 2alpha cdot 3alpha^2 - 2alpha cdot 4alpha + 2alpha cdot frac{alpha^2 + 5}{2alpha} - 2alpha cdot 2 = 0 )Simplify each term:1. ( 2alpha cdot 3alpha^2 = 6alpha^3 )2. ( -2alpha cdot 4alpha = -8alpha^2 )3. ( 2alpha cdot frac{alpha^2 + 5}{2alpha} = alpha^2 + 5 ) (the 2alpha cancels out)4. ( -2alpha cdot 2 = -4alpha )So, putting it all together:( 6alpha^3 - 8alpha^2 + alpha^2 + 5 - 4alpha = 0 )Combine like terms:- ( 6alpha^3 )- ( -8alpha^2 + alpha^2 = -7alpha^2 )- ( -4alpha )- ( +5 )So, the equation becomes:( 6alpha^3 - 7alpha^2 - 4alpha + 5 = 0 )Hmm, now I have a cubic equation in terms of ( alpha ). Solving cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.I remember the Rational Root Theorem, which states that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction ( frac{p}{q} ), has ( p ) as a factor of the constant term and ( q ) as a factor of the leading coefficient.In this case, the constant term is 5, and the leading coefficient is 6. So, possible rational roots are ( pm1, pm5, pmfrac{1}{2}, pmfrac{5}{2}, pmfrac{1}{3}, pmfrac{5}{3}, pmfrac{1}{6}, pmfrac{5}{6} ).Let me test these possible roots by plugging them into the cubic equation.Starting with ( alpha = 1 ):( 6(1)^3 - 7(1)^2 - 4(1) + 5 = 6 - 7 - 4 + 5 = 0 ). Oh, that works! So, ( alpha = 1 ) is a root.Great, so we can factor out ( (alpha - 1) ) from the cubic equation.Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.Using synthetic division with root 1:Coefficients: 6 | -7 | -4 | 5Bring down the 6.Multiply 6 by 1: 6. Add to next coefficient: -7 + 6 = -1.Multiply -1 by 1: -1. Add to next coefficient: -4 + (-1) = -5.Multiply -5 by 1: -5. Add to last coefficient: 5 + (-5) = 0.So, the cubic factors as ( (alpha - 1)(6alpha^2 - alpha - 5) = 0 ).Now, set each factor equal to zero:1. ( alpha - 1 = 0 ) => ( alpha = 1 )2. ( 6alpha^2 - alpha - 5 = 0 )Let's solve the quadratic equation ( 6alpha^2 - alpha - 5 = 0 ) using the quadratic formula.Quadratic formula: ( alpha = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Here, ( a = 6 ), ( b = -1 ), ( c = -5 ).Discriminant: ( (-1)^2 - 4(6)(-5) = 1 + 120 = 121 )Square root of discriminant: ( sqrt{121} = 11 )So,( alpha = frac{-(-1) pm 11}{2 times 6} = frac{1 pm 11}{12} )Thus,1. ( alpha = frac{1 + 11}{12} = frac{12}{12} = 1 )2. ( alpha = frac{1 - 11}{12} = frac{-10}{12} = -frac{5}{6} )Wait, so the roots are ( alpha = 1 ) and ( alpha = -frac{5}{6} ). But we already had ( alpha = 1 ) from the first factor, so it's a repeated root.So, the possible common roots are ( alpha = 1 ) and ( alpha = -frac{5}{6} ).Now, let's check each of these roots in the original equations to see if they indeed result in integer values of ( p ).Starting with ( alpha = 1 ):From the second equation, which we used earlier:( p = frac{alpha^2 + 5}{2alpha} )Plugging in ( alpha = 1 ):( p = frac{1 + 5}{2 times 1} = frac{6}{2} = 3 )So, ( p = 3 ). Let's verify this in the first equation.First equation: ( 3x^2 - 4x + p - 2 = 0 )Substitute ( x = 1 ) and ( p = 3 ):( 3(1)^2 - 4(1) + 3 - 2 = 3 - 4 + 3 - 2 = 0 ). Perfect, it works.Now, let's check the other root ( alpha = -frac{5}{6} ):Again, using the expression for ( p ):( p = frac{alpha^2 + 5}{2alpha} )Plugging in ( alpha = -frac{5}{6} ):First, compute ( alpha^2 ):( left(-frac{5}{6}right)^2 = frac{25}{36} )So,( p = frac{frac{25}{36} + 5}{2 times -frac{5}{6}} )Convert 5 to 36ths to add:( 5 = frac{180}{36} )So,( p = frac{frac{25}{36} + frac{180}{36}}{2 times -frac{5}{6}} = frac{frac{205}{36}}{-frac{10}{6}} )Simplify the denominator:( -frac{10}{6} = -frac{5}{3} )So,( p = frac{205}{36} div left(-frac{5}{3}right) = frac{205}{36} times left(-frac{3}{5}right) )Multiply numerators and denominators:Numerator: ( 205 times (-3) = -615 )Denominator: ( 36 times 5 = 180 )Simplify ( frac{-615}{180} ):Divide numerator and denominator by 15:( frac{-615 ÷ 15}{180 ÷ 15} = frac{-41}{12} )So, ( p = -frac{41}{12} ). Hmm, that's not an integer. The problem specifies that ( p ) should be an integer. Therefore, ( alpha = -frac{5}{6} ) is not a valid solution because it results in a non-integer ( p ).Therefore, the only valid common root is ( alpha = 1 ), which gives ( p = 3 ).Wait, just to make sure, let me double-check by plugging ( p = 3 ) into both equations and see if they indeed have a common root at ( x = 1 ).First equation: ( 3x^2 - 4x + 3 - 2 = 3x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 )Let me factor this quadratic:Looking for two numbers that multiply to ( 3 times 1 = 3 ) and add up to -4.Hmm, factors of 3 are 1 and 3. So, 1 and 3 don't add up to -4. Maybe it doesn't factor nicely. Let me compute the discriminant:Discriminant: ( (-4)^2 - 4(3)(1) = 16 - 12 = 4 )Square root of discriminant: 2So, roots are:( x = frac{4 pm 2}{6} )Which gives:1. ( x = frac{4 + 2}{6} = 1 )2. ( x = frac{4 - 2}{6} = frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3} )So, the roots are 1 and ( frac{1}{3} ). So, yes, 1 is a root.Second equation: ( x^2 - 2(3)x + 5 = x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 )Factor this quadratic:Looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Those are -5 and -1.So, factors: ( (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0 )Thus, roots are 5 and 1. So, yes, 1 is a common root.Therefore, everything checks out.So, the integer value of ( p ) is 3, and the common root is 1.**Final Answer**The integer value of ( p ) is boxed{3} and the common root is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given f(x) = x^2 + ax + b, satisfying f(1) = 0 and f(2) = 0, then f(-1) = boxed{6}.","answer":"First, I recognize that the quadratic function ( f(x) = x^2 + ax + b ) has roots at ( x = 1 ) and ( x = 2 ) because ( f(1) = 0 ) and ( f(2) = 0 ).Using the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation ( x^2 + px + q = 0 ) is ( -p ), I can determine the value of ( a ). Here, the sum of the roots is ( 1 + 2 = 3 ), so ( a = -3 ).Next, the product of the roots is ( 1 times 2 = 2 ), which equals ( b ). Therefore, ( b = 2 ).With ( a = -3 ) and ( b = 2 ), the function becomes ( f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2 ).Finally, to find ( f(-1) ), I substitute ( x = -1 ) into the function:[f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 3(-1) + 2 = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6]"},{"question":"Solve the system:[begin{cases}3^{y} cdot 81 = 9^{x^{2}} lg y = lg x - lg 0.5end{cases}]","answer":"Okay, so I have this system of equations to solve:[begin{cases}3^{y} cdot 81 = 9^{x^{2}} lg y = lg x - lg 0.5end{cases}]Hmm, let's see. I need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I'll take it step by step.Starting with the first equation: (3^{y} cdot 81 = 9^{x^{2}}). I notice that 81 and 9 are both powers of 3. Maybe I can rewrite them to have the same base, which might make it easier to compare exponents.I know that 81 is (3^4) because (3 times 3 times 3 times 3 = 81). Similarly, 9 is (3^2). So, let me rewrite the equation using base 3.So, substituting 81 with (3^4) and 9 with (3^2), the equation becomes:(3^{y} cdot 3^4 = (3^2)^{x^2})Now, using the laws of exponents, when you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. So, on the left side, (3^{y} cdot 3^4) becomes (3^{y + 4}).On the right side, when you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So, ((3^2)^{x^2}) becomes (3^{2x^2}).So now, the equation is:(3^{y + 4} = 3^{2x^2})Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore:(y + 4 = 2x^2)Okay, so that's one equation: (y = 2x^2 - 4). I'll keep that in mind.Now, moving on to the second equation: (lg y = lg x - lg 0.5). Hmm, logarithms. I remember that (lg a - lg b = lg frac{a}{b}), so maybe I can combine those terms.Let me rewrite the equation:(lg y = lg left( frac{x}{0.5} right))Simplifying (frac{x}{0.5}), that's the same as (2x), because dividing by 0.5 is like multiplying by 2. So, the equation becomes:(lg y = lg (2x))Again, since the logarithms are equal, their arguments must be equal. So:(y = 2x)Alright, so now I have two equations:1. (y = 2x^2 - 4)2. (y = 2x)Great, now I can set them equal to each other because both equal y. So:(2x^2 - 4 = 2x)Let me rearrange this equation to form a quadratic equation. Subtract 2x from both sides:(2x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0)Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of x. Let me see if I can simplify it. All coefficients are even, so I can divide the entire equation by 2:(x^2 - x - 2 = 0)Okay, that's simpler. Now, let's solve for x. I can try factoring this quadratic. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -2 and add to -1.Let me think: factors of -2 are (1, -2) and (-1, 2). Let's see:1 and -2: 1 + (-2) = -1. Perfect. So, the quadratic factors as:((x + 1)(x - 2) = 0)Therefore, the solutions are:(x + 1 = 0) => (x = -1)or(x - 2 = 0) => (x = 2)So, x can be either -1 or 2. Now, let's find the corresponding y values using the equation (y = 2x).First, if x = -1:(y = 2(-1) = -2)Second, if x = 2:(y = 2(2) = 4)So, we have two potential solutions: (x, y) = (-1, -2) and (2, 4).But wait, I need to check if these solutions satisfy the original equations, especially because logarithms are involved, and logarithms are only defined for positive real numbers.Looking back at the second equation: (lg y = lg x - lg 0.5). The logarithm function is only defined for positive numbers, so both y and x must be positive.So, let's check each solution:1. For (x, y) = (-1, -2):Here, x is -1 and y is -2. Both are negative, which means their logarithms are undefined. So, this solution is invalid.2. For (x, y) = (2, 4):Here, x is 2 and y is 4. Both are positive, so their logarithms are defined. Let's plug these into the original equations to verify.First equation: (3^{4} cdot 81 = 9^{(2)^2})Calculating left side: (3^4 = 81), so (81 cdot 81 = 6561)Right side: (9^{4} = (9^2)^2 = 81^2 = 6561). So, both sides equal 6561. Good.Second equation: (lg 4 = lg 2 - lg 0.5)Calculating right side: (lg 2 - lg 0.5). Since (lg 0.5 = lg frac{1}{2} = -lg 2), so:(lg 2 - (-lg 2) = lg 2 + lg 2 = 2lg 2)Now, (lg 4) is equal to (lg 2^2 = 2lg 2). So, both sides equal (2lg 2). Perfect.Therefore, the only valid solution is (2, 4).Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me double-check.First equation: (3^y cdot 81 = 9^{x^2})For x=2, y=4:Left side: (3^4 cdot 81 = 81 cdot 81 = 6561)Right side: (9^{4} = (3^2)^4 = 3^8 = 6561). Yep, that's correct.Second equation: (lg y = lg x - lg 0.5)For x=2, y=4:Left side: (lg 4)Right side: (lg 2 - lg 0.5). Since (lg 0.5 = -lg 2), so it's (lg 2 + lg 2 = 2lg 2). And (lg 4 = lg 2^2 = 2lg 2). So, that's correct too.And for x=-1, y=-2, as I saw earlier, both logarithms are undefined, so that solution is invalid.Therefore, the only solution is x=2 and y=4.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The solution is (boxed{x = 2}) and (boxed{y = 4}).Wait, hold on, the instructions say to put the final answer within boxed{}, but it's a system, so maybe I should present both together? Maybe like boxed{(2, 4)}? Let me check the original problem. It says \\"Solve the system\\" and gives two equations, so the solution is a pair (x, y). So, yeah, probably better to write the ordered pair.**Final Answer**The solution is (boxed{(2, 4)})."},{"question":"Among all triangles ABC, find the maximum value of sin A + sin B sin C.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: Among all triangles ABC, find the maximum value of sin A + sin B sin C. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out the maximum value of this expression. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that in any triangle, the sum of the angles is π radians (or 180 degrees). So, A + B + C = π. That might be useful. Maybe I can express one angle in terms of the others. For example, C = π - A - B. Then, I can write everything in terms of A and B.So, let me rewrite the expression:sin A + sin B sin C = sin A + sin B sin(π - A - B)But sin(π - x) = sin x, so this simplifies to:sin A + sin B sin(A + B)Hmm, okay. So, now the expression is sin A + sin B sin(A + B). Maybe I can expand sin(A + B) using the sine addition formula. Let's recall that sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. So, substituting that in:sin A + sin B [sin A cos B + cos A sin B] = sin A + sin B sin A cos B + sin B cos A sin BSimplify that:sin A + sin A sin B cos B + sin² B cos AHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Perhaps using calculus to maximize the function with respect to angles A and B, considering the constraint A + B + C = π.Alternatively, maybe I can use some trigonometric identities or inequalities to find the maximum. Let me think about the expression again: sin A + sin B sin C.I wonder if I can express this in terms of a single variable. Since A + B + C = π, if I fix angle A, then B + C = π - A. Maybe I can express sin B sin C in terms of B and C, but since B + C is fixed, perhaps I can use some identity for the product of sines.I recall that sin B sin C can be written as [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2. Let me try that:sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2But since B + C = π - A, cos(B + C) = cos(π - A) = -cos A. So, substituting:sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - (-cos A)] / 2 = [cos(B - C) + cos A] / 2Therefore, the original expression becomes:sin A + [cos(B - C) + cos A] / 2Simplify:sin A + (cos(B - C))/2 + (cos A)/2Hmm, so sin A + (cos A)/2 + (cos(B - C))/2Now, the expression is in terms of A and the difference between B and C. Since we want to maximize this expression, maybe we can consider the maximum over B and C for a fixed A.Given that B + C = π - A, the difference B - C can vary. Let me denote D = B - C. Then, since B + C is fixed, D can range from -(π - A) to +(π - A). But since angles are positive, actually D ranges from -(π - A) to +(π - A), but B and C must each be between 0 and π.Wait, actually, since B and C are both positive and sum to π - A, the maximum difference D can be is π - A, when one angle is 0 and the other is π - A, but since angles can't be zero in a triangle, it's approaching that. So, D can be between -(π - A) and +(π - A). However, cos D is an even function, so the maximum of cos D occurs at D = 0, which is cos 0 = 1.Therefore, for a fixed A, the maximum value of cos(B - C) is 1, which occurs when B = C. So, for each fixed A, the maximum of sin A + sin B sin C is sin A + (1 + cos A)/2.Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing sin A + (1 + cos A)/2 over A in (0, π).So, let's define f(A) = sin A + (1 + cos A)/2. We need to find the maximum of f(A) for A in (0, π).Let me compute f(A):f(A) = sin A + 1/2 + (cos A)/2So, f(A) = sin A + (cos A)/2 + 1/2To find the maximum, we can take the derivative of f(A) with respect to A and set it to zero.Compute f'(A):f'(A) = cos A - (sin A)/2Set f'(A) = 0:cos A - (sin A)/2 = 0Multiply both sides by 2:2 cos A - sin A = 0So, 2 cos A = sin ADivide both sides by cos A (assuming cos A ≠ 0):2 = tan ASo, tan A = 2Therefore, A = arctan(2)Compute arctan(2). Let me recall that tan(π/4) = 1, tan(π/3) ≈ 1.732, so arctan(2) is approximately 63.4349 degrees, which is about 1.107 radians.So, A ≈ 1.107 radians.Now, let's compute f(A) at this critical point.First, compute sin A and cos A when tan A = 2.If tan A = 2, then we can imagine a right triangle with opposite side 2, adjacent side 1, hypotenuse sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5).Therefore, sin A = 2 / sqrt(5), cos A = 1 / sqrt(5)So, sin A = 2√5 / 5, cos A = √5 / 5Therefore, f(A) = sin A + (cos A)/2 + 1/2Substitute:f(A) = (2√5 / 5) + (√5 / 5)/2 + 1/2Simplify:First term: 2√5 / 5Second term: (√5 / 5) * 1/2 = √5 / 10Third term: 1/2So, f(A) = 2√5 / 5 + √5 / 10 + 1/2Combine the terms with √5:2√5 / 5 = 4√5 / 10So, 4√5 / 10 + √5 / 10 = 5√5 / 10 = √5 / 2Therefore, f(A) = √5 / 2 + 1/2So, f(A) = (√5 + 1)/2 ≈ (2.236 + 1)/2 ≈ 3.236 / 2 ≈ 1.618Hmm, interesting. That's approximately the golden ratio.Wait, let me verify the calculation:f(A) = sin A + (1 + cos A)/2Given sin A = 2/√5, cos A = 1/√5So, f(A) = 2/√5 + (1 + 1/√5)/2Compute:2/√5 + 1/2 + 1/(2√5)Combine the terms with 1/√5:2/√5 + 1/(2√5) = (4 + 1)/(2√5) = 5/(2√5) = √5 / 2So, f(A) = √5 / 2 + 1/2, which is the same as (√5 + 1)/2. Yes, that's correct.So, the maximum value of f(A) is (√5 + 1)/2, which is approximately 1.618.Now, I need to check if this is indeed a maximum. Let me compute the second derivative.Compute f''(A):f'(A) = cos A - (sin A)/2f''(A) = -sin A - (cos A)/2At A = arctan(2), sin A = 2/√5, cos A = 1/√5So, f''(A) = -2/√5 - (1/√5)/2 = -2/√5 - 1/(2√5) = (-4/2√5 - 1/(2√5)) = (-5)/(2√5) = -√5 / 2 < 0Since the second derivative is negative, this critical point is indeed a maximum.Therefore, the maximum value of sin A + sin B sin C is (√5 + 1)/2.But wait, let me make sure that this is indeed the global maximum over all triangles. Because we fixed A and then maximized over B and C by setting B = C. So, is there a possibility that for some other configuration where B ≠ C, we could get a higher value?Wait, earlier, I considered that for a fixed A, the maximum of sin B sin C occurs when B = C, because cos(B - C) is maximized when B = C. So, that seems correct because cos(B - C) is maximum at 1 when B = C.Therefore, for each A, the maximum of sin B sin C is achieved when B = C, so the overall maximum should be achieved when both A is arctan(2) and B = C.So, let's confirm that in such a triangle, the angles are A = arctan(2), B = C = (π - A)/2.Compute B:B = (π - arctan(2))/2Let me compute arctan(2):As I mentioned earlier, arctan(2) ≈ 1.107 radians, so π - arctan(2) ≈ 3.1416 - 1.107 ≈ 2.0346 radians, so B ≈ 2.0346 / 2 ≈ 1.0173 radians, which is approximately 58.28 degrees.So, angles are approximately 63.43 degrees, 58.28 degrees, and 58.28 degrees.Let me compute sin A + sin B sin C for these angles:sin(1.107) ≈ sin(arctan(2)) = 2/√5 ≈ 0.8944sin(1.0173) ≈ sin(58.28 degrees) ≈ 0.849So, sin B sin C ≈ 0.849 * 0.849 ≈ 0.721Therefore, sin A + sin B sin C ≈ 0.8944 + 0.721 ≈ 1.6154, which is approximately equal to (√5 + 1)/2 ≈ (2.236 + 1)/2 ≈ 1.618, so that's consistent.Therefore, the maximum value is indeed (√5 + 1)/2.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a way to represent this without calculus? Maybe using some trigonometric identities or inequalities.Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers, considering the constraint A + B + C = π.But since I already have a solution using calculus and it seems consistent, maybe that's sufficient.Alternatively, perhaps using substitution.Let me consider that in triangle ABC, angles A, B, C satisfy A + B + C = π.Let me denote x = A, y = B, z = C, so x + y + z = π.We need to maximize sin x + sin y sin z.But since z = π - x - y, we can write sin z = sin(x + y).So, the expression becomes sin x + sin y sin(x + y).As before.Alternatively, perhaps using substitution variables.Let me set t = y, so z = π - x - t.But I don't know if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of sides.Wait, maybe using the sine formula: a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C = 2R.But I'm not sure if that would help here.Alternatively, maybe express sin A + sin B sin C in terms of sides.But perhaps that complicates things.Alternatively, maybe using Jensen's inequality, but since the function is a combination of sine functions, which are concave in [0, π], but I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe consider that for fixed A, the maximum of sin B sin C is achieved when B = C, as I did before.Therefore, the maximum over all triangles is achieved when the triangle is isoceles with B = C.Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing sin A + sin² B, where A + 2B = π.So, A = π - 2B.So, sin A = sin(π - 2B) = sin 2B = 2 sin B cos B.Therefore, the expression becomes:2 sin B cos B + sin² BSo, f(B) = 2 sin B cos B + sin² BLet me write this as:f(B) = sin B (2 cos B + sin B)Hmm, maybe I can write this in terms of a single trigonometric function.Alternatively, let me express everything in terms of sin B.Let me denote t = sin B, then cos B = sqrt(1 - t²), since B is between 0 and π/2 (since A = π - 2B must be positive, so B < π/2).So, f(B) = 2 t sqrt(1 - t²) + t²So, f(t) = 2 t sqrt(1 - t²) + t², where t ∈ (0, sin(π/2)) = (0, 1)Now, to find the maximum of f(t) in (0, 1).Take derivative with respect to t:f'(t) = 2 sqrt(1 - t²) + 2 t * ( -2t ) / (2 sqrt(1 - t²)) ) + 2tWait, let me compute it step by step.First term: d/dt [2 t sqrt(1 - t²)] = 2 sqrt(1 - t²) + 2 t * ( -2t ) / (2 sqrt(1 - t²)) )Wait, actually, using product rule:d/dt [2 t sqrt(1 - t²)] = 2 sqrt(1 - t²) + 2 t * ( derivative of sqrt(1 - t²) )Derivative of sqrt(1 - t²) is (1/(2 sqrt(1 - t²))) * (-2t) = -t / sqrt(1 - t²)So, putting it together:2 sqrt(1 - t²) + 2 t * (-t / sqrt(1 - t²)) = 2 sqrt(1 - t²) - 2 t² / sqrt(1 - t²)Second term: d/dt [t²] = 2tTherefore, total derivative:f'(t) = 2 sqrt(1 - t²) - 2 t² / sqrt(1 - t²) + 2tSet f'(t) = 0:2 sqrt(1 - t²) - 2 t² / sqrt(1 - t²) + 2t = 0Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 - t²) to eliminate the denominator:2 (1 - t²) - 2 t² + 2t sqrt(1 - t²) = 0Simplify:2 - 2 t² - 2 t² + 2t sqrt(1 - t²) = 0Combine like terms:2 - 4 t² + 2t sqrt(1 - t²) = 0Let me write this as:2t sqrt(1 - t²) = 4 t² - 2Divide both sides by 2:t sqrt(1 - t²) = 2 t² - 1Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:t² (1 - t²) = (2 t² - 1)^2Expand both sides:Left side: t² - t⁴Right side: 4 t⁴ - 4 t² + 1So, equation:t² - t⁴ = 4 t⁴ - 4 t² + 1Bring all terms to one side:t² - t⁴ - 4 t⁴ + 4 t² - 1 = 0Combine like terms:( t² + 4 t² ) + ( -t⁴ - 4 t⁴ ) - 1 = 05 t² - 5 t⁴ - 1 = 0Multiply both sides by -1:5 t⁴ - 5 t² + 1 = 0Let me set u = t², so equation becomes:5 u² - 5 u + 1 = 0Solve for u:u = [5 ± sqrt(25 - 20)] / 10 = [5 ± sqrt(5)] / 10So, u = [5 + sqrt(5)] / 10 or u = [5 - sqrt(5)] / 10Since u = t² must be between 0 and 1, both solutions are valid because [5 ± sqrt(5)] / 10 are both positive and less than 1.Compute [5 + sqrt(5)] / 10 ≈ (5 + 2.236)/10 ≈ 7.236/10 ≈ 0.7236Compute [5 - sqrt(5)] / 10 ≈ (5 - 2.236)/10 ≈ 2.764/10 ≈ 0.2764So, t² = 0.7236 or t² = 0.2764Therefore, t = sqrt(0.7236) ≈ 0.8507 or t = sqrt(0.2764) ≈ 0.526But remember, we squared the equation earlier, so we might have introduced extraneous solutions. So, we need to check which of these solutions satisfy the original equation t sqrt(1 - t²) = 2 t² - 1.Let me check t ≈ 0.8507:Left side: 0.8507 * sqrt(1 - 0.7236) ≈ 0.8507 * sqrt(0.2764) ≈ 0.8507 * 0.526 ≈ 0.448Right side: 2*(0.7236) - 1 ≈ 1.4472 - 1 ≈ 0.4472These are approximately equal, so this is a valid solution.Now, t ≈ 0.526:Left side: 0.526 * sqrt(1 - 0.2764) ≈ 0.526 * sqrt(0.7236) ≈ 0.526 * 0.8507 ≈ 0.448Right side: 2*(0.2764) - 1 ≈ 0.5528 - 1 ≈ -0.4472So, left side ≈ 0.448, right side ≈ -0.4472. These are not equal, so this is an extraneous solution.Therefore, the only valid solution is t ≈ 0.8507, which is sin B ≈ 0.8507, so B ≈ arcsin(0.8507) ≈ 58.28 degrees, which is consistent with earlier calculations.So, sin B ≈ 0.8507, so B ≈ 58.28 degrees, which is approximately 1.017 radians.Therefore, A = π - 2B ≈ 3.1416 - 2*1.017 ≈ 3.1416 - 2.034 ≈ 1.107 radians, which is arctan(2), as before.So, this confirms the earlier result.Therefore, the maximum value is (√5 + 1)/2.But let me write this as (1 + √5)/2, which is approximately 1.618, which is the golden ratio.Therefore, the maximum value of sin A + sin B sin C is (1 + √5)/2.I think this is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The maximum value is boxed{dfrac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}}."},{"question":"A right triangle has legs a and b and hypotenuse c.  Find the largest possible value of[frac{a + b}{c}.]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: A right triangle has legs ( a ) and ( b ) and hypotenuse ( c ). I need to find the largest possible value of ( frac{a + b}{c} ). Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that in a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem holds, which is ( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ). So, that's a key equation I can use here. The expression I need to maximize is ( frac{a + b}{c} ). Maybe I can express this in terms of one variable or find some relationship between ( a ) and ( b ) that can help me maximize this ratio.Let me think about how to approach this. One way to maximize an expression is to use calculus, taking derivatives and finding critical points. But since this is a right triangle, maybe there's a trigonometric approach as well. Alternatively, I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overcomplicating things. Let me try the calculus approach first.Let me denote ( S = frac{a + b}{c} ). I need to maximize ( S ). Since ( c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ), I can write ( S ) as ( frac{a + b}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} ). Hmm, that seems manageable.Maybe I can express this in terms of a single variable by assuming a ratio between ( a ) and ( b ). Let's say ( a = k cdot b ), where ( k ) is some positive constant. Then, substituting into ( S ), we get:( S = frac{k b + b}{sqrt{(k b)^2 + b^2}} = frac{b(k + 1)}{b sqrt{k^2 + 1}}} = frac{k + 1}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} ).So now, ( S ) is expressed solely in terms of ( k ). Now, I can think of ( S ) as a function of ( k ), say ( S(k) = frac{k + 1}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} ). To find the maximum value of ( S(k) ), I can take the derivative of ( S ) with respect to ( k ) and set it equal to zero.Let me compute the derivative. Let me denote ( f(k) = frac{k + 1}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} ). Then, ( f'(k) ) is:Using the quotient rule, ( f'(k) = frac{(1)(sqrt{k^2 + 1}) - (k + 1)(frac{1}{2})(k^2 + 1)^{-1/2}(2k)}{(k^2 + 1)} ).Simplifying the numerator:First term: ( sqrt{k^2 + 1} ).Second term: ( (k + 1) cdot frac{1}{2} cdot 2k cdot (k^2 + 1)^{-1/2} = (k + 1)k (k^2 + 1)^{-1/2} ).So, the numerator becomes:( sqrt{k^2 + 1} - frac{k(k + 1)}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} ).Combine the terms over a common denominator:( frac{(k^2 + 1) - k(k + 1)}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} ).Simplify the numerator inside the numerator:( (k^2 + 1) - k^2 - k = 1 - k ).So, the numerator is ( frac{1 - k}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} ).Therefore, the derivative ( f'(k) = frac{1 - k}{(k^2 + 1)^{3/2}} ).To find critical points, set ( f'(k) = 0 ):( frac{1 - k}{(k^2 + 1)^{3/2}} = 0 ).The denominator is always positive, so the numerator must be zero:( 1 - k = 0 implies k = 1 ).So, the critical point is at ( k = 1 ). Now, I should check whether this is a maximum or a minimum. Let's test values around ( k = 1 ).For ( k < 1 ), say ( k = 0.5 ):( f'(0.5) = frac{1 - 0.5}{(0.25 + 1)^{3/2}} = frac{0.5}{(1.25)^{3/2}} > 0 ). So, the function is increasing before ( k = 1 ).For ( k > 1 ), say ( k = 2 ):( f'(2) = frac{1 - 2}{(4 + 1)^{3/2}} = frac{-1}{(5)^{3/2}} < 0 ). So, the function is decreasing after ( k = 1 ).Therefore, ( k = 1 ) is indeed a maximum point.So, the maximum value of ( S(k) ) occurs when ( k = 1 ), which means ( a = b ). So, the triangle is an isosceles right triangle.Now, let's compute ( S ) when ( a = b ). Let me denote ( a = b = x ). Then, ( c = sqrt{x^2 + x^2} = sqrt{2x^2} = x sqrt{2} ).So, ( S = frac{x + x}{x sqrt{2}} = frac{2x}{x sqrt{2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} ).Therefore, the maximum value of ( frac{a + b}{c} ) is ( sqrt{2} ).Wait, let me verify this another way just to be sure. Maybe using trigonometry.In a right triangle, we can express ( a = c cos theta ) and ( b = c sin theta ), where ( theta ) is one of the acute angles. Then, ( frac{a + b}{c} = cos theta + sin theta ).So, we need to maximize ( cos theta + sin theta ) for ( 0 < theta < frac{pi}{2} ).I remember that ( cos theta + sin theta = sqrt{2} sin left( theta + frac{pi}{4} right) ). The maximum value of ( sin ) function is 1, so the maximum of ( sqrt{2} sin left( theta + frac{pi}{4} right) ) is ( sqrt{2} ). This occurs when ( theta + frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{2} ), so ( theta = frac{pi}{4} ). Which again corresponds to an isosceles right triangle where ( a = b ). So, this confirms the earlier result.Another way to think about this is using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The expression ( a + b ) can be thought of as the dot product of the vector ( (a, b) ) with the vector ( (1, 1) ). The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality tells us that:( (a + b)^2 leq (a^2 + b^2)(1^2 + 1^2) = (a^2 + b^2)(2) ).Taking square roots on both sides:( a + b leq sqrt{2(a^2 + b^2)} = sqrt{2} c ).Therefore, ( frac{a + b}{c} leq sqrt{2} ).Equality holds when ( (a, b) ) is proportional to ( (1, 1) ), which again means ( a = b ). So, this method also gives the same result.Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me consider if there's any other approach. Maybe using substitution or some algebraic manipulation.Suppose I let ( t = frac{a}{b} ), so ( a = t b ). Then, ( c = sqrt{t^2 b^2 + b^2} = b sqrt{t^2 + 1} ). Then, ( frac{a + b}{c} = frac{t b + b}{b sqrt{t^2 + 1}} = frac{t + 1}{sqrt{t^2 + 1}} ). This is the same expression as before, so we can see that regardless of substitution, the expression reduces to the same function of a single variable, which we've already maximized.Alternatively, using calculus of multiple variables. Let me consider ( f(a, b) = frac{a + b}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} ). To find its maximum, we can set up the Lagrangian with the constraint ( g(a, b) = a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = 0 ). But since ( c ) is dependent on ( a ) and ( b ), maybe it's better to just use substitution as before.Alternatively, using partial derivatives. Let me compute the partial derivatives of ( f(a, b) ) with respect to ( a ) and ( b ) and set them equal to zero.First, ( f(a, b) = frac{a + b}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} ).Compute ( frac{partial f}{partial a} ):Using the quotient rule:Numerator derivative: 1.Denominator: ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ).Derivative of denominator: ( frac{1}{2}(a^2 + b^2)^{-1/2} cdot 2a = frac{a}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} ).So, ( frac{partial f}{partial a} = frac{1 cdot sqrt{a^2 + b^2} - (a + b) cdot frac{a}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}}{a^2 + b^2} ).Simplify numerator:( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} - frac{a(a + b)}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = frac{(a^2 + b^2) - a(a + b)}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = frac{a^2 + b^2 - a^2 - ab}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = frac{b^2 - ab}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} ).So, ( frac{partial f}{partial a} = frac{b^2 - ab}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} ).Similarly, ( frac{partial f}{partial b} = frac{a^2 - ab}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} ).To find critical points, set both partial derivatives equal to zero.So,1. ( frac{b^2 - ab}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} = 0 )2. ( frac{a^2 - ab}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} = 0 )The denominators are positive, so we can focus on the numerators:From equation 1: ( b^2 - ab = 0 implies b(b - a) = 0 ).From equation 2: ( a^2 - ab = 0 implies a(a - b) = 0 ).So, from equation 1: Either ( b = 0 ) or ( b = a ).From equation 2: Either ( a = 0 ) or ( a = b ).Since ( a ) and ( b ) are legs of a triangle, they can't be zero. Therefore, the only solution is ( a = b ).Thus, the critical point occurs when ( a = b ), which again leads us to the isosceles right triangle. Therefore, the maximum value is ( sqrt{2} ).Just to make sure, let me test some specific triangles.Case 1: ( a = 1 ), ( b = 1 ). Then, ( c = sqrt{2} ). So, ( frac{1 + 1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} approx 1.4142 ).Case 2: ( a = 3 ), ( b = 4 ). Then, ( c = 5 ). So, ( frac{3 + 4}{5} = frac{7}{5} = 1.4 ), which is less than ( sqrt{2} ).Case 3: ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ). Then, ( c = sqrt{5} approx 2.236 ). So, ( frac{1 + 2}{2.236} approx frac{3}{2.236} approx 1.3416 ), which is still less than ( sqrt{2} ).Case 4: Let me try ( a = 1 ), ( b = 1000 ). Then, ( c approx 1000.0005 ). So, ( frac{1 + 1000}{1000.0005} approx frac{1001}{1000.0005} approx 1.0009995 ), which is just slightly above 1, still way less than ( sqrt{2} ).Case 5: What if I take ( a = b = 1000 ). Then, ( c = 1000 sqrt{2} approx 1414.2136 ). So, ( frac{1000 + 1000}{1414.2136} = frac{2000}{1414.2136} approx 1.4142 ), which is exactly ( sqrt{2} ).So, all these cases confirm that the maximum value is indeed ( sqrt{2} ), achieved when ( a = b ).Another thought: Could there be a triangle where ( a ) or ( b ) is zero? But in that case, it wouldn't be a triangle anymore, just a line segment. So, both ( a ) and ( b ) must be positive.Alternatively, if one of them approaches zero, the ratio ( frac{a + b}{c} ) approaches 1, which is less than ( sqrt{2} ). So, the maximum must occur somewhere in between, which we've found to be when ( a = b ).Therefore, after considering multiple approaches—calculus, trigonometry, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and specific examples—I'm confident that the largest possible value of ( frac{a + b}{c} ) is ( sqrt{2} ).**Final Answer**The largest possible value is boxed{sqrt{2}}."},{"question":"It is known that (frac{7}{13} + sin varphi = cos varphi) for some real (varphi). What is (sin 2 varphi)?","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: (frac{7}{13} + sin varphi = cos varphi). I need to find (sin 2varphi). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that (sin 2varphi) can be expressed using the double-angle identity: (sin 2varphi = 2 sin varphi cos varphi). So, if I can find the values of (sin varphi) and (cos varphi), I can plug them into this identity to get the answer.Looking back at the given equation: (frac{7}{13} + sin varphi = cos varphi).

What is the measure of angle (A B C)?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a cube, and points A, B, and C are the midpoints of its edges. I need to find the measure of angle ABC. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.First, a cube has 12 edges, right? Each edge is the same length, so if I assume the cube has edges of length 2 units, then the midpoints will be at 1 unit from each vertex. That might make calculations easier because working with integers can be simpler.Let me try to sketch this in my mind. Let's say the cube is oriented so that one corner is at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite corner is at (2,2,2). So, each edge goes from 0 to 2 along one of the axes.Now, points A, B, and C are midpoints. I need to figure out their positions. Maybe I should assign specific edges to each point to make it concrete. Let's say:- Point A is the midpoint of the edge from (0,0,0) to (2,0,0). So, A would be at (1,0,0).- Point B is the midpoint of the edge from (2,0,0) to (2,2,0). So, B would be at (2,1,0).- Point C is the midpoint of the edge from (2,2,0) to (2,2,2). So, C would be at (2,2,1).Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. If A is the midpoint of the front bottom edge, B is the midpoint of the right bottom edge, and C is the midpoint of the right back edge. So, connecting A to B to C would form a triangle. I need to find angle ABC, which is the angle at point B between points A, B, and C.To find angle ABC, I can use vector analysis. If I can find the vectors BA and BC, then I can use the dot product formula to find the angle between them.First, let's find the coordinates of points A, B, and C:- A: (1,0,0)- B: (2,1,0)- C: (2,2,1)Now, vector BA is from B to A, which is A - B. So:BA = (1 - 2, 0 - 1, 0 - 0) = (-1, -1, 0)Similarly, vector BC is from B to C, which is C - B:BC = (2 - 2, 2 - 1, 1 - 0) = (0, 1, 1)Okay, so BA is (-1, -1, 0) and BC is (0, 1, 1). Now, to find the angle between BA and BC, I can use the dot product formula:BA · BC = |BA| |BC| cos(theta)Where theta is the angle between them.First, compute the dot product:BA · BC = (-1)(0) + (-1)(1) + (0)(1) = 0 - 1 + 0 = -1Next, compute the magnitudes of BA and BC.|BA| = sqrt((-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(1 + 1 + 0) = sqrt(2)|BC| = sqrt(0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(0 + 1 + 1) = sqrt(2)So, plugging into the formula:-1 = (sqrt(2))(sqrt(2)) cos(theta)Simplify:-1 = 2 cos(theta)Therefore, cos(theta) = -1/2What angle has a cosine of -1/2? Well, I remember that cos(120°) = -1/2. So, theta is 120 degrees.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The vectors BA and BC are (-1, -1, 0) and (0, 1, 1). Their dot product is indeed -1. The magnitudes are both sqrt(2). So, yes, cos(theta) is -1/2, which corresponds to 120 degrees.Is there another way to verify this? Maybe by constructing the triangle and using the law of cosines.Let me compute the lengths of BA, BC, and AC.Wait, actually, in triangle ABC, we have points A, B, and C. So, sides are AB, BC, and AC.Wait, but angle ABC is at point B, so the sides involved are BA and BC, which we already have as vectors. So, the lengths are |BA| = sqrt(2), |BC| = sqrt(2), and the length of AC.Wait, let me compute AC. Point A is (1,0,0), point C is (2,2,1). So, AC is the distance between these two points.AC = sqrt[(2 - 1)^2 + (2 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2] = sqrt[1 + 4 + 1] = sqrt(6)So, in triangle ABC, sides are:AB: distance from A to B. A is (1,0,0), B is (2,1,0). So, AB = sqrt[(2-1)^2 + (1-0)^2 + (0-0)^2] = sqrt[1 + 1 + 0] = sqrt(2)BC: distance from B to C. B is (2,1,0), C is (2,2,1). So, BC = sqrt[(2-2)^2 + (2-1)^2 + (1-0)^2] = sqrt[0 + 1 + 1] = sqrt(2)AC: sqrt(6) as above.So, triangle ABC has sides AB = sqrt(2), BC = sqrt(2), and AC = sqrt(6). So, it's an isoceles triangle with two sides equal to sqrt(2) and the third side sqrt(6). Let me apply the law of cosines to find angle at B.Law of cosines says:AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 AB BC cos(theta)Plugging in the values:(sqrt(6))^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 - 2 (sqrt(2))(sqrt(2)) cos(theta)Simplify:6 = 2 + 2 - 2 * 2 cos(theta)6 = 4 - 4 cos(theta)Subtract 4 from both sides:2 = -4 cos(theta)Divide both sides by -4:cos(theta) = -2 / 4 = -1/2So, theta = arccos(-1/2) = 120 degrees.Yep, that matches what I got earlier with the vectors. So, that's reassuring.Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I should consider the cube in a different orientation or choose different midpoints? Because depending on which edges A, B, and C are on, the angle might be different.But in the problem statement, it just says A, B, and C are midpoints of its edges. It doesn't specify which edges, so I think the configuration I chose is a valid one, but maybe the angle is the same regardless of the edges chosen?Wait, let me think. In a cube, all edges are equivalent in terms of symmetry, so regardless of which midpoints you choose, as long as they form a similar triangle, the angle should be the same. So, 120 degrees is likely the correct answer.Alternatively, if I had chosen different midpoints, say, not all on the same face, would the angle still be 120 degrees? Hmm, let me test that.Suppose point A is the midpoint of an edge on the front face, point B is the midpoint of an edge on the top face, and point C is the midpoint of an edge on the back face. Would angle ABC still be 120 degrees?Wait, maybe not. Because depending on how the points are connected, the triangle could be different. But in the problem, it just says A, B, and C are midpoints of its edges. So, unless specified otherwise, I think the minimal case is that they are on adjacent edges, forming a triangle on the surface of the cube.But in my initial assumption, points A, B, and C are on edges that are all on the same face or adjacent faces. Wait, in my coordinate system, points A, B, and C are on the bottom face, right face, and back face, respectively.But in that case, the triangle ABC is not on a single face but spans across different faces.Wait, but in any case, using vectors or the law of cosines, I arrived at 120 degrees. So, unless I made a mistake in assigning coordinates, which I don't think I did, 120 degrees should be correct.Alternatively, maybe the angle is 90 degrees? Wait, but in the calculations, the dot product was negative, which implies an obtuse angle, so 120 degrees makes sense.Wait, another way to think about it: in 3D space, the vectors BA and BC are not in the same plane, so the angle between them is not necessarily 90 degrees. In fact, since their dot product is negative, the angle is greater than 90 degrees, which is consistent with 120 degrees.So, putting it all together, I think the measure of angle ABC is 120 degrees.**Final Answer**The measure of angle (ABC) is boxed{120^circ})."},{"question":"John buys 1000 balloons.

Let me see. The numerator has two terms: (2n+1)! and (2n+2)!. The denominator is (2n+3)!.I remember that factorials can be expressed in terms of smaller factorials. For example, (2n+2)! is equal to (2n+2)*(2n+1)! Similarly, (2n+3)! is (2n+3)*(2n+2)*(2n+1)!.So maybe I can factor out (2n+1)! from the numerator and the denominator. Let me try that.First, let's rewrite the numerator:(2n+1)! + (2n+2)! = (2n+1)! + (2n+2)*(2n+1)! So that's equal to (2n+1)! [1 + (2n+2)]Similarly, the denominator is (2n+3)! = (2n+3)*(2n+2)*(2n+1)!.So now, substituting back into the limit expression:lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{(2n+1)! [1 + (2n+2)]}{(2n+3)*(2n+2)*(2n+1)!}Oh, I see that (2n+1)! cancels out from numerator and denominator. So that simplifies to:lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{1 + (2n+2)}{(2n+3)(2n+2)}Let me write that out:lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{1 + 2n + 2}{(2n+3)(2n+2)} = lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{2n + 3}{(2n+3)(2n+2)}Wait, 1 + 2n + 2 is 2n + 3. So that's correct.So now, the expression simplifies to:lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{2n + 3}{(2n+3)(2n+2)} = lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{1}{2n + 2}Wait, how? Let me check. If I have (2n + 3) in the numerator and (2n + 3)(2n + 2) in the denominator, then the (2n + 3) cancels out, leaving 1/(2n + 2).So, yes, that simplifies to 1/(2n + 2). Now, as n approaches infinity, 2n + 2 also approaches infinity, so 1 divided by something going to infinity should approach 0.Therefore, the limit is 0.But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Factor out (2n+1)! from numerator: Correct.2. Simplify numerator: 1 + (2n + 2) = 2n + 3: Correct.3. Denominator: (2n+3)(2n+2): Correct.4. Cancel (2n + 3): Correct.5. Remaining expression: 1/(2n + 2): Correct.6. As n approaches infinity, 1/(2n + 2) approaches 0: Correct.So, yeah, I think that's right. The limit is 0.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using the ratio test or something else, but I think the way I did it is straightforward.Another way: Maybe divide numerator and denominator by (2n+2)!.Let me try that.Numerator: (2n+1)! + (2n+2)! = (2n+1)! + (2n+2)*(2n+1)! = (2n+1)! [1 + (2n+2)] = (2n+1)! (2n + 3)Denominator: (2n+3)! = (2n+3)*(2n+2)*(2n+1)!.So, if I divide numerator and denominator by (2n+1)!:Numerator becomes (2n + 3)Denominator becomes (2n + 3)(2n + 2)So, same as before, the expression becomes (2n + 3)/[(2n + 3)(2n + 2)] = 1/(2n + 2), which tends to 0 as n approaches infinity.Same result. So that's consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can use Stirling's approximation for factorials, but that might be overcomplicating it. Stirling's formula is n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n. But since all terms are factorials, perhaps it's not necessary here because we can factor out terms and simplify.But just for practice, let me try using Stirling's approximation.Stirling's formula: n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n.So, let's approximate each factorial:(2n + 1)! ≈ sqrt(2π(2n + 1)) * ((2n + 1)/e)^{2n + 1}(2n + 2)! ≈ sqrt(2π(2n + 2)) * ((2n + 2)/e)^{2n + 2}(2n + 3)! ≈ sqrt(2π(2n + 3)) * ((2n + 3)/e)^{2n + 3}So, numerator: (2n + 1)! + (2n + 2)! ≈ sqrt(2π(2n + 1)) * ((2n + 1)/e)^{2n + 1} + sqrt(2π(2n + 2)) * ((2n + 2)/e)^{2n + 2}Denominator: sqrt(2π(2n + 3)) * ((2n + 3)/e)^{2n + 3}Hmm, this seems more complicated, but let's see if we can factor out some terms.Let me factor out sqrt(2π(2n + 1)) * ((2n + 1)/e)^{2n + 1} from the numerator:Numerator ≈ sqrt(2π(2n + 1)) * ((2n + 1)/e)^{2n + 1} [1 + sqrt((2n + 2)/(2n + 1)) * ((2n + 2)/(2n + 1))^{2n + 2} * e^{-1}]Wait, that might not be the right way to factor. Let me think.Alternatively, note that (2n + 2)! = (2n + 2)*(2n + 1)! So, in the numerator, we can write:(2n + 1)! [1 + (2n + 2)]Which is similar to what I did earlier.So, perhaps Stirling's formula isn't necessary here because we can factor out terms and cancel them, leading to a simpler expression.So, I think my initial approach is sufficient and correct.Therefore, the limit is 0.**Final Answer**The limit is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Find an integer  n , where  100 leq n leq 1997 , such that \\r[ frac{2^n+2}{n}  ] \\ris also an integer.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find an integer ( n ) between 100 and 1997 such that ( frac{2^n + 2}{n} ) is an integer. Hmm, that sounds like a number theory problem. I remember that when dealing with expressions like ( 2^n ) modulo ( n ), Fermat's Little Theorem might come into play. Let me think about how I can apply that here.First, let me rewrite the condition given. If ( frac{2^n + 2}{n} ) is an integer, that means ( 2^n + 2 ) is divisible by ( n ). So, mathematically, we can express this as:[2^n + 2 equiv 0 pmod{n}]Which simplifies to:[2^n equiv -2 pmod{n}]Alright, so ( 2^n ) is congruent to ( -2 ) modulo ( n ). I need to find such an ( n ) in the given range.I recall that for primes ( p ), Fermat's Little Theorem tells us that ( 2^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). Maybe I can use this theorem somehow. Let me see. If ( n ) is a prime, then ( 2^{n-1} equiv 1 pmod{n} ). So, ( 2^n equiv 2 pmod{n} ). But in our case, we have ( 2^n equiv -2 pmod{n} ). So, if ( n ) is prime, we would have:[2 equiv -2 pmod{n}]Which implies:[4 equiv 0 pmod{n}]So, ( n ) would have to divide 4. But ( n ) is at least 100, so the only divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4, which are all less than 100. Therefore, ( n ) cannot be a prime number. So, ( n ) must be composite.Okay, so ( n ) is composite. Maybe I can look into pseudoprimes or something similar. I remember that pseudoprimes to base 2 are composite numbers ( n ) such that ( 2^{n-1} equiv 1 pmod{n} ). But in our case, we have ( 2^n equiv -2 pmod{n} ), which is a bit different.Let me try to manipulate the congruence ( 2^n equiv -2 pmod{n} ). If I multiply both sides by 2, I get:[2^{n+1} equiv -4 pmod{n}]Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can write ( 2^n equiv -2 pmod{n} ) as:[2^n + 2 equiv 0 pmod{n}]Which is the original condition. Maybe I can factor this expression. Let's see:[2^n + 2 = 2(2^{n-1} + 1)]So, ( n ) must divide ( 2(2^{n-1} + 1) ). Since ( n ) is composite, it's not prime, so it must have some prime factors. Let me denote ( p ) as a prime divisor of ( n ). Then, ( p ) divides ( 2(2^{n-1} + 1) ). So, either ( p ) divides 2 or ( p ) divides ( 2^{n-1} + 1 ).If ( p ) divides 2, then ( p = 2 ). So, 2 is a prime divisor of ( n ). Alternatively, if ( p ) is an odd prime divisor of ( n ), then ( p ) divides ( 2^{n-1} + 1 ), which implies:[2^{n-1} equiv -1 pmod{p}]If I square both sides, I get:[2^{2(n-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p}]So, the order of 2 modulo ( p ) divides ( 2(n-1) ). Let me denote the order of 2 modulo ( p ) as ( d ). Then, ( d ) divides ( 2(n-1) ). Also, since ( 2^{n-1} equiv -1 pmod{p} ), the order ( d ) must be exactly ( 2k ), where ( k ) is the order of 2 modulo ( p ) if we consider ( 2^{n-1} equiv -1 pmod{p} ). Hmm, this is getting a bit abstract.Wait, maybe I can think about this differently. If ( 2^{n-1} equiv -1 pmod{p} ), then ( 2^{2(n-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). So, the order of 2 modulo ( p ) divides ( 2(n-1) ) but does not divide ( n-1 ), because ( 2^{n-1} equiv -1 pmod{p} neq 1 pmod{p} ). Therefore, the order ( d ) must be exactly ( 2k ), where ( k ) is the order such that ( k ) divides ( n-1 ).This suggests that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo ( p ) is even and exactly twice the order that would make ( 2^{n-1} equiv -1 pmod{p} ). So, perhaps ( n-1 ) is a multiple of ( k ), but not a multiple of ( 2k ). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.Alternatively, maybe I can consider specific composite numbers and test the condition. But since ( n ) is between 100 and 1997, that's a lot of numbers. I need a smarter approach.Let me think about the case where ( n ) is even. Since ( n ) must divide ( 2(2^{n-1} + 1) ), and if ( n ) is even, then 2 is a factor. So, let me write ( n = 2m ), where ( m ) is an integer. Then, substituting back, we have:[2^{2m} + 2 equiv 0 pmod{2m}]Which simplifies to:[2^{2m} + 2 equiv 0 pmod{2} quad text{and} quad 2^{2m} + 2 equiv 0 pmod{m}]The first condition is trivially satisfied because ( 2^{2m} ) is even, and 2 is even, so their sum is even. So, the real condition is:[2^{2m} + 2 equiv 0 pmod{m}]Which is:[2^{2m} equiv -2 pmod{m}]Hmm, so now we have a similar condition but with ( m ) instead of ( n ). Maybe this can lead us somewhere.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider specific forms of ( n ). For example, suppose ( n ) is a Carmichael number. Carmichael numbers satisfy ( b^{n-1} equiv 1 pmod{n} ) for all integers ( b ) that are relatively prime to ( n ). But in our case, we have ( 2^n equiv -2 pmod{n} ), which is different.Wait, let me think again about the original condition:[2^n equiv -2 pmod{n}]If I rearrange this, I get:[2^n + 2 equiv 0 pmod{n}]Which is:[2(2^{n-1} + 1) equiv 0 pmod{n}]So, ( n ) divides ( 2(2^{n-1} + 1) ). Since ( n ) is composite, let me denote its prime factors. Suppose ( p ) is an odd prime factor of ( n ). Then, ( p ) divides ( 2^{n-1} + 1 ), so:[2^{n-1} equiv -1 pmod{p}]Squaring both sides:[2^{2(n-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p}]So, the order of 2 modulo ( p ) divides ( 2(n-1) ). Let me denote the order as ( d ). Then, ( d ) divides ( 2(n-1) ). Also, since ( 2^{n-1} equiv -1 pmod{p} ), ( d ) does not divide ( n-1 ), so ( d ) must be exactly ( 2k ), where ( k ) divides ( n-1 ). Therefore, the order of 2 modulo ( p ) is twice an odd divisor of ( n-1 ).This suggests that for each odd prime ( p ) dividing ( n ), the order of 2 modulo ( p ) is even, specifically twice some divisor of ( n-1 ). Maybe I can use this property to find possible ( p ) and then construct ( n ) accordingly.Alternatively, perhaps I can look for numbers ( n ) such that ( n ) divides ( 2^n + 2 ). These numbers are sometimes called \\"Wieferich-like\\" numbers, but I'm not sure if they have a specific name. I know that 341 is a pseudoprime to base 2, but let me check if it satisfies our condition.Wait, 341 is 11 × 31. Let me compute ( 2^{341} + 2 ) modulo 341. Since 341 is composite, I can compute modulo 11 and 31 separately.First, modulo 11:( 2^{10} equiv 1 pmod{11} ) by Fermat's Little Theorem. So, ( 2^{340} equiv (2^{10})^{34} equiv 1^{34} equiv 1 pmod{11} ). Therefore, ( 2^{341} equiv 2 pmod{11} ). So, ( 2^{341} + 2 equiv 2 + 2 = 4 pmod{11} ). Since 4 is not 0 modulo 11, 341 does not satisfy the condition.Hmm, so 341 is out. Let me try another pseudoprime, like 561. 561 is 3 × 11 × 17. Let's compute ( 2^{561} + 2 ) modulo 561.Modulo 3:( 2^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} ). So, ( 2^{560} equiv (2^2)^{280} equiv 1^{280} equiv 1 pmod{3} ). Thus, ( 2^{561} equiv 2 pmod{3} ). So, ( 2^{561} + 2 equiv 2 + 2 = 4 equiv 1 pmod{3} ). Not zero, so 561 doesn't work either.Hmm, maybe I need to look for a different kind of number. Let me think about the condition again: ( 2^n equiv -2 pmod{n} ). If I write this as ( 2^{n} + 2 equiv 0 pmod{n} ), which is ( 2(2^{n-1} + 1) equiv 0 pmod{n} ). So, ( n ) divides ( 2(2^{n-1} + 1) ).If ( n ) is even, as we considered earlier, then 2 is a factor, so ( n = 2m ), and ( m ) must divide ( 2^{2m} + 2 ). Wait, that seems recursive. Maybe I can try small values of ( m ) and see if I can find a pattern.But since ( n ) is between 100 and 1997, ( m ) would be between 50 and 998.5, so up to 998. That's still a lot. Maybe I can find a specific form for ( n ).Wait, another thought: if ( n ) is a divisor of ( 2^n + 2 ), then ( n ) must be a divisor of ( 2^{n+1} - 4 ), because ( 2^{n+1} - 4 = 2(2^n - 2) ), but I'm not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that ( n ) divides ( 2^{n} + 2 ), so ( n ) must be a divisor of ( 2^{n+1} - 4 ) as well, since ( 2^{n+1} - 4 = 2(2^n - 2) ). But I'm not sure if that's useful.Wait, let me think about specific numbers. I remember that 946 is a number that sometimes comes up in similar problems. Let me check if 946 satisfies the condition.First, 946 is even, so let's see. ( 2^{946} + 2 ) modulo 946. Since 946 = 2 × 11 × 43. Let's compute modulo 11 and 43.Modulo 11:( 2^{10} equiv 1 pmod{11} ). So, ( 2^{946} = 2^{10 times 94 + 6} = (2^{10})^{94} times 2^6 equiv 1^{94} times 64 equiv 64 pmod{11} ). 64 divided by 11 is 5 with remainder 9, so ( 64 equiv 9 pmod{11} ). Therefore, ( 2^{946} + 2 equiv 9 + 2 = 11 equiv 0 pmod{11} ). Good.Modulo 43:( 2^{42} equiv 1 pmod{43} ) by Fermat's Little Theorem. So, ( 2^{946} = 2^{42 times 22 + 22} = (2^{42})^{22} times 2^{22} equiv 1^{22} times 2^{22} pmod{43} ). Now, compute ( 2^{22} pmod{43} ).Compute ( 2^1 = 2 )( 2^2 = 4 )( 2^4 = 16 )( 2^8 = 256 equiv 256 - 6*43 = 256 - 258 = -2 equiv 41 pmod{43} )( 2^{16} = (2^8)^2 equiv 41^2 = 1681 ). 1681 divided by 43: 43*39=1677, so 1681 - 1677 = 4. So, ( 2^{16} equiv 4 pmod{43} ).Then, ( 2^{22} = 2^{16} times 2^4 times 2^2 equiv 4 times 16 times 4 = 4 times 64 ). 64 mod 43 is 21, so 4 × 21 = 84. 84 mod 43 is 84 - 2*43 = 84 - 86 = -2 ≡ 41 mod 43.So, ( 2^{22} equiv 41 pmod{43} ). Therefore, ( 2^{946} equiv 41 pmod{43} ). Then, ( 2^{946} + 2 equiv 41 + 2 = 43 equiv 0 pmod{43} ). Perfect.Since 946 is 2 × 11 × 43, and we've shown that both 11 and 43 divide ( 2^{946} + 2 ), and 2 obviously divides ( 2^{946} + 2 ) because it's even, so 946 divides ( 2^{946} + 2 ). Therefore, ( frac{2^{946} + 2}{946} ) is an integer.So, 946 is a solution. Let me check if there are any other solutions in the range. I recall that 946 is the only known solution in that range, but I should verify.Wait, let me think about how 946 was constructed. It's 2 × 11 × 43. Let me check if these primes satisfy certain conditions. For prime 11: ( 2^{10} equiv 1 pmod{11} ), so the order is 10. For prime 43: ( 2^{42} equiv 1 pmod{43} ), so the order is 42. Now, in our condition, for each prime ( p ) dividing ( n ), we have ( 2^{n-1} equiv -1 pmod{p} ).So, for p=11: ( 2^{945} equiv -1 pmod{11} ). Let's check:Since ( 2^{10} equiv 1 pmod{11} ), ( 2^{945} = 2^{10 times 94 + 5} = (2^{10})^{94} times 2^5 equiv 1^{94} times 32 equiv 32 pmod{11} ). 32 mod 11 is 10, which is -1 mod 11. So, yes, it works.For p=43: ( 2^{945} equiv -1 pmod{43} ). Since ( 2^{42} equiv 1 pmod{43} ), ( 2^{945} = 2^{42 times 22 + 21} = (2^{42})^{22} times 2^{21} equiv 1^{22} times 2^{21} pmod{43} ). Compute ( 2^{21} pmod{43} ).We know ( 2^7 = 128 ≡ 128 - 3*43 = 128 - 129 = -1 pmod{43} ). So, ( 2^7 ≡ -1 pmod{43} ). Then, ( 2^{21} = (2^7)^3 ≡ (-1)^3 = -1 pmod{43} ). Therefore, ( 2^{945} ≡ -1 pmod{43} ). Perfect.So, both primes satisfy the condition ( 2^{n-1} ≡ -1 pmod{p} ), which is necessary for ( n ) to divide ( 2^n + 2 ). Therefore, 946 is indeed a solution.Are there any other numbers like this? I think 946 is the only known composite number satisfying this condition in the given range. Let me check another number, say 342. 342 is 2 × 3 × 3 × 19.Compute ( 2^{342} + 2 ) modulo 342. Let's check modulo 3, 3, and 19.Modulo 3: ( 2^2 ≡ 1 pmod{3} ). So, ( 2^{342} = (2^2)^{171} ≡ 1^{171} ≡ 1 pmod{3} ). Thus, ( 2^{342} + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 = 0 pmod{3} ). Good.Modulo 19: ( 2^{18} ≡ 1 pmod{19} ). So, ( 2^{342} = 2^{18 times 19} ≡ 1^{19} ≡ 1 pmod{19} ). Thus, ( 2^{342} + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 pmod{19} ). Not zero, so 342 doesn't work.Another number, 161038? Wait, that's way beyond 1997. Maybe 946 is the only one.Wait, let me check 341 again. Earlier, I saw that modulo 11, it didn't work. But let me double-check. 341 is 11 × 31.Compute ( 2^{341} + 2 ) modulo 11 and 31.Modulo 11: ( 2^{10} ≡ 1 pmod{11} ). ( 2^{341} = 2^{10 times 34 + 1} ≡ (1)^{34} times 2 ≡ 2 pmod{11} ). So, ( 2 + 2 = 4 pmod{11} ). Not zero.Modulo 31: ( 2^5 = 32 ≡ 1 pmod{31} ). So, ( 2^{341} = 2^{5 times 68 + 1} ≡ (1)^{68} times 2 ≡ 2 pmod{31} ). Thus, ( 2 + 2 = 4 pmod{31} ). Not zero. So, 341 doesn't work.Another candidate: 273. 273 is 3 × 7 × 13.Compute ( 2^{273} + 2 ) modulo 3, 7, 13.Modulo 3: ( 2^2 ≡ 1 pmod{3} ). ( 2^{273} = 2^{2 times 136 + 1} ≡ (1)^{136} times 2 ≡ 2 pmod{3} ). So, ( 2 + 2 = 4 ≡ 1 pmod{3} ). Not zero.So, 273 doesn't work.Wait, maybe I should look for numbers where for each prime factor ( p ), ( 2^{n-1} ≡ -1 pmod{p} ). So, for each prime ( p ) dividing ( n ), ( 2^{2(n-1)} ≡ 1 pmod{p} ), meaning the order of 2 modulo ( p ) divides ( 2(n-1) ) but not ( n-1 ). So, the order is exactly twice an odd divisor of ( n-1 ).In the case of 946, ( n = 946 ), so ( n - 1 = 945 ). 945 factors into 945 = 5 × 7 × 9 × 3, wait, 945 = 5 × 7 × 9 × 3? Wait, 945 ÷ 5 = 189, 189 ÷ 3 = 63, 63 ÷ 3 = 21, 21 ÷ 3 = 7. So, 945 = 3^3 × 5 × 7.So, for each prime ( p ) dividing 946 (which are 2, 11, 43), we have:For p=11: order of 2 modulo 11 is 10, which is 2 × 5. 5 divides 945.For p=43: order of 2 modulo 43 is 14, which is 2 × 7. 7 divides 945.So, both orders are twice a divisor of 945. That's why 946 works.So, perhaps to find such ( n ), we need ( n ) to be composite, and for each prime ( p ) dividing ( n ), the order of 2 modulo ( p ) is twice a divisor of ( n - 1 ).Given that, 946 is constructed from primes 11 and 43, whose orders are 10 and 14, respectively, which are twice 5 and 7, which are factors of 945.So, 946 is the only such number in the given range because constructing another would require finding other primes where the order of 2 is twice a factor of ( n - 1 ), and such primes are rare.Therefore, after this lengthy exploration, I conclude that ( n = 946 ) is the integer satisfying the given condition."},{"question":"In a geometric sequence with positive terms {a_n} where a_1=3, the sum of the first three terms is equal to 21, find the value of a_4+a_5+a_6.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to remember what a geometric sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, right? So, if the first term is ( a_1 ), then the second term is ( a_1 times r ), the third term is ( a_1 times r^2 ), and so on. The problem says that the sequence has positive terms, so that means all the terms are positive, which is good because it might help avoid any complications with negative numbers or zero. The first term ( a_1 ) is given as 3. So, ( a_1 = 3 ). It also says that the sum of the first three terms is equal to 21. So, ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 21 ). Since it's a geometric sequence, I can express ( a_2 ) and ( a_3 ) in terms of ( a_1 ) and the common ratio ( r ). Let me write that out:( a_1 = 3 )( a_2 = a_1 times r = 3r )( a_3 = a_2 times r = 3r^2 )So, the sum of the first three terms is:( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3 + 3r + 3r^2 = 21 )Okay, so I can set up the equation:( 3 + 3r + 3r^2 = 21 )Hmm, let me simplify this equation. First, I can factor out a 3 from all the terms on the left side:( 3(1 + r + r^2) = 21 )Then, divide both sides by 3 to make it simpler:( 1 + r + r^2 = 7 )So, now I have a quadratic equation:( r^2 + r + 1 = 7 )Wait, actually, subtract 7 from both sides to set it to zero:( r^2 + r + 1 - 7 = 0 )Which simplifies to:( r^2 + r - 6 = 0 )Alright, so I need to solve this quadratic equation for ( r ). Let's see, quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, factoring, or completing the square. Let me try factoring first because it might be quicker.Looking for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to 1. Let me think: factors of -6 are (1, -6), (-1, 6), (2, -3), (-2, 3). Let's see, 3 and -2 multiply to -6 and add up to 1. Yes, that works.So, the equation factors as:( (r + 3)(r - 2) = 0 )Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:( r + 3 = 0 ) => ( r = -3 )( r - 2 = 0 ) => ( r = 2 )But wait, the problem says the sequence has positive terms. If ( r = -3 ), then the terms would alternate between positive and negative because each term is multiplied by a negative number. For example, ( a_1 = 3 ), ( a_2 = 3 times (-3) = -9 ), which is negative, but the problem states all terms are positive. So, ( r = -3 ) is not acceptable.Therefore, the common ratio must be ( r = 2 ).Okay, so now that I have ( r = 2 ), I can find the terms ( a_4 ), ( a_5 ), and ( a_6 ). Let me write out the terms up to ( a_6 ) to make sure I have them right.( a_1 = 3 )( a_2 = 3 times 2 = 6 )( a_3 = 6 times 2 = 12 )( a_4 = 12 times 2 = 24 )( a_5 = 24 times 2 = 48 )( a_6 = 48 times 2 = 96 )So, ( a_4 = 24 ), ( a_5 = 48 ), ( a_6 = 96 ). The problem asks for the sum ( a_4 + a_5 + a_6 ). Let me compute that:( 24 + 48 + 96 )First, 24 + 48 is 72, and then 72 + 96 is 168. So, the sum is 168.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from ( a_4 ):( a_4 = a_3 times r = 12 times 2 = 24 ) – that's correct.( a_5 = a_4 times r = 24 times 2 = 48 ) – correct.( a_6 = a_5 times r = 48 times 2 = 96 ) – correct.Sum: 24 + 48 = 72; 72 + 96 = 168. Yep, that seems right.Alternatively, I can think about the sum of ( a_4 + a_5 + a_6 ) as the sum of the fourth, fifth, and sixth terms. Since it's a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by ( r ) each time. So, the sum of the first three terms is 21, and each subsequent set of three terms is multiplied by ( r^3 ).Wait, let me think about that. The sum of the first three terms is 21, which is ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 21 ). Then, ( a_4 + a_5 + a_6 ) would be ( a_1 r^3 + a_2 r^3 + a_3 r^3 ), which is ( r^3 (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) ). So, that would be ( r^3 times 21 ).Since ( r = 2 ), ( r^3 = 8 ). So, ( 8 times 21 = 168 ). That's another way to get the same result, which confirms that 168 is the correct answer.I think that makes sense. So, whether I calculate each term individually and add them up or use the property of geometric sequences to find the sum of the next three terms by multiplying the first sum by ( r^3 ), I get the same result. That gives me confidence that 168 is the right answer.Just to recap:1. Recognize it's a geometric sequence with ( a_1 = 3 ).2. Express the first three terms in terms of ( r ).3. Set up the equation for the sum of the first three terms and solve for ( r ).4. Discard the negative ratio because the terms are positive.5. Calculate the next three terms or use the ratio to find the sum of the next three terms.6. Verify the result using an alternative method to ensure accuracy.So, yeah, I think I've got it. The value of ( a_4 + a_5 + a_6 ) is 168.**Final Answer**The value of ( a_4 + a_5 + a_6 ) is boxed{168}."},{"question":"What is dbinom{n}{1} for any positive integer n?","answer":"To determine the value of (dbinom{n}{1}) for any positive integer (n), I start by recalling the formula for combinations, which is (dbinom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}).Substituting (k = 1) into the formula, I get (dbinom{n}{1} = frac{n!}{1!(n - 1)!}).Next, I simplify the factorial expressions. Since (1! = 1) and (n! = n times (n - 1)!), the expression becomes (dbinom{n}{1} = frac{n times (n - 1)!}{1 times (n - 1)!}).The ((n - 1)!) terms cancel out, leaving (dbinom{n}{1} = n).Therefore, (dbinom{n}{1}) is equal to (n) for any positive integer (n)."},{"question":"Find the general solution of the equation ( y'' - 5y' + 6y = 0 ) and identify the particular solution that satisfies the initial conditions ( y = 1 ) and ( y' = 2 ) at ( x = 0 ).","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the general solution of the differential equation ( y'' - 5y' + 6y = 0 ) and then determine the particular solution that satisfies the initial conditions ( y(0) = 1 ) and ( y'(0) = 2 ). Hmm, let's see. I remember that for linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, we can solve them by finding the characteristic equation. First, let me write down the characteristic equation associated with this differential equation. The equation is ( y'' - 5y' + 6y = 0 ). The characteristic equation should be ( r^2 - 5r + 6 = 0 ). Yeah, that makes sense because the coefficients correspond to the derivatives of y.Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me factor it. Looking at ( r^2 - 5r + 6 ), I need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. Hmm, -2 and -3? Because (-2) * (-3) = 6 and (-2) + (-3) = -5. Perfect! So, the equation factors as ( (r - 2)(r - 3) = 0 ). Therefore, the roots are ( r = 2 ) and ( r = 3 ).Since the roots are real and distinct, the general solution of the differential equation is going to be a combination of exponential functions with these roots as exponents. So, the general solution should be ( y(x) = C_1 e^{2x} + C_2 e^{3x} ), where ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) are constants determined by the initial conditions.Alright, now that I have the general solution, I need to find the particular solution that satisfies the initial conditions ( y(0) = 1 ) and ( y'(0) = 2 ). Let me plug in ( x = 0 ) into the general solution to get the first equation.Calculating ( y(0) ):( y(0) = C_1 e^{2*0} + C_2 e^{3*0} = C_1 * 1 + C_2 * 1 = C_1 + C_2 ).And we know that ( y(0) = 1 ), so:( C_1 + C_2 = 1 ). Let's call this Equation (1).Next, I need to find ( y'(x) ) to use the second initial condition. Let's differentiate the general solution:( y'(x) = d/dx [C_1 e^{2x} + C_2 e^{3x}] = 2C_1 e^{2x} + 3C_2 e^{3x} ).Now, evaluate ( y'(0) ):( y'(0) = 2C_1 e^{2*0} + 3C_2 e^{3*0} = 2C_1 * 1 + 3C_2 * 1 = 2C_1 + 3C_2 ).Given that ( y'(0) = 2 ), so:( 2C_1 + 3C_2 = 2 ). Let's call this Equation (2).Now, I have a system of two equations:1. ( C_1 + C_2 = 1 )2. ( 2C_1 + 3C_2 = 2 )I need to solve for ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ). Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.Let's multiply Equation (1) by 2 to make the coefficients of ( C_1 ) the same:1. ( 2C_1 + 2C_2 = 2 )2. ( 2C_1 + 3C_2 = 2 )Now, subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):( (2C_1 + 3C_2) - (2C_1 + 2C_2) = 2 - 2 )Simplify:( 0C_1 + C_2 = 0 )So, ( C_2 = 0 ).Wait, that's interesting. If ( C_2 = 0 ), then from Equation (1), ( C_1 + 0 = 1 ), so ( C_1 = 1 ).Hmm, let me verify this. If ( C_1 = 1 ) and ( C_2 = 0 ), then the particular solution is ( y(x) = e^{2x} ). Let's check the initial conditions.At ( x = 0 ), ( y(0) = e^{0} = 1 ), which matches. Now, the derivative ( y'(x) = 2e^{2x} ). At ( x = 0 ), ( y'(0) = 2e^{0} = 2 ), which also matches. So, that seems correct.Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in solving the system of equations. Let me double-check.Equation (1): ( C_1 + C_2 = 1 )Equation (2): ( 2C_1 + 3C_2 = 2 )If I solve Equation (1) for ( C_1 ): ( C_1 = 1 - C_2 ). Then substitute into Equation (2):( 2(1 - C_2) + 3C_2 = 2 )Expand:( 2 - 2C_2 + 3C_2 = 2 )Combine like terms:( 2 + C_2 = 2 )Subtract 2:( C_2 = 0 )So, ( C_1 = 1 ). Yep, that's consistent. So, no mistake there.Therefore, the particular solution is ( y(x) = e^{2x} ).But just to recap, the general solution is ( y(x) = C_1 e^{2x} + C_2 e^{3x} ), and with the initial conditions, we found ( C_1 = 1 ) and ( C_2 = 0 ). So, the particular solution is simply ( y(x) = e^{2x} ).I think that's it. It seems straightforward, but let me just make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. I started with the characteristic equation, found the roots, wrote the general solution, applied the initial conditions, solved the system, and verified the solution. Everything checks out.**Final Answer**The particular solution is boxed{e^{2x}}."},{"question":"If m^{2}-2m-1=0, then the value of 3m^{2}-6m+2020 is ______.","answer":"To solve the problem, I start with the given equation ( m^2 - 2m - 1 = 0 ). My goal is to find the value of ( 3m^2 - 6m + 2020 ).First, I notice that ( 3m^2 - 6m ) can be factored as ( 3(m^2 - 2m) ). This allows me to use the original equation to substitute for ( m^2 - 2m ).From the original equation, ( m^2 - 2m = 1 ). Substituting this into the expression, I get ( 3(1) = 3 ).Finally, I add 2020 to this result, which gives me ( 3 + 2020 = 2023 ).Therefore, the value of ( 3m^2 - 6m + 2020 ) is 2023."},{"question":"Given that the common ratio of a geometric sequence is 2, and the sum of its first four terms is equal to 1, then the sum of the first eight terms equals to ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a geometric sequence. Let me read it again: \\"Given that the common ratio of a geometric sequence is 2, and the sum of its first four terms is equal to 1, then the sum of the first eight terms equals to ______.\\" Hmm, okay. I need to find the sum of the first eight terms. Alright, let's start by recalling what a geometric sequence is. A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. In this case, the common ratio is 2. So, if the first term is, say, ( a ), then the terms go like ( a, 2a, 4a, 8a, 16a, ) and so on.The problem says that the sum of the first four terms is 1. So, let's write that down. The sum of the first four terms ( S_4 ) is equal to 1. The formula for the sum of the first ( n ) terms of a geometric sequence is ( S_n = a times frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} ), where ( a ) is the first term, ( r ) is the common ratio, and ( n ) is the number of terms. Given that ( r = 2 ) and ( S_4 = 1 ), let's plug those values into the formula. So, ( S_4 = a times frac{2^4 - 1}{2 - 1} ). Calculating the numerator: ( 2^4 = 16 ), so ( 16 - 1 = 15 ). The denominator is ( 2 - 1 = 1 ). So, ( S_4 = a times frac{15}{1} = 15a ). But we know that ( S_4 = 1 ), so ( 15a = 1 ). Therefore, solving for ( a ), we get ( a = frac{1}{15} ).Okay, so the first term ( a ) is ( frac{1}{15} ). Now, we need to find the sum of the first eight terms, which is ( S_8 ). Using the same formula for the sum of a geometric sequence, ( S_8 = a times frac{r^8 - 1}{r - 1} ). Plugging in the known values, ( a = frac{1}{15} ), ( r = 2 ), so ( S_8 = frac{1}{15} times frac{2^8 - 1}{2 - 1} ).Let me compute ( 2^8 ). I know that ( 2^8 = 256 ), so ( 256 - 1 = 255 ). The denominator is ( 2 - 1 = 1 ). So, ( S_8 = frac{1}{15} times frac{255}{1} = frac{255}{15} ). Simplifying that, ( 255 ÷ 15 = 17 ). So, ( S_8 = 17 ).Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with ( S_4 = 1 ), which gave me ( a = frac{1}{15} ). Then, using ( S_8 ), I plugged in ( a = frac{1}{15} ) and ( r = 2 ), so ( S_8 = frac{1}{15} times (2^8 - 1) ). Since ( 2^8 = 256 ), subtracting 1 gives 255. Dividing 255 by 15 is indeed 17. So, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. Since each term is double the previous one, the sum of the first four terms is 1, and then the next four terms would be each of those terms doubled. So, the sum of the next four terms would be double the sum of the first four terms, which is 2. Therefore, the sum of the first eight terms would be the sum of the first four plus the sum of the next four, which is ( 1 + 2 = 3 ). Wait, that contradicts my earlier result. Hmm, that's confusing.Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in that alternative approach. Let me think again. If the first four terms sum to 1, and each subsequent term is double the previous one, then the fifth term is double the fourth term, the sixth is double the fifth, and so on. So, the fifth term is ( 2 times ) fourth term, sixth is ( 2 times ) fifth, seventh is ( 2 times ) sixth, and eighth is ( 2 times ) seventh. So, the fifth term is ( 2 times ) fourth, which is ( 2 times (2^3 a) = 2^4 a ). Similarly, the sixth term is ( 2^5 a ), seventh is ( 2^6 a ), and eighth is ( 2^7 a ).So, the sum of the next four terms (fifth to eighth) is ( 2^4 a + 2^5 a + 2^6 a + 2^7 a ). Factor out ( 2^4 a ), which is ( 16a ), so it becomes ( 16a (1 + 2 + 4 + 8) = 16a times 15 ). Wait, but ( a = frac{1}{15} ), so substituting, that's ( 16 times frac{1}{15} times 15 = 16 times 1 = 16 ). So, the sum of the next four terms is 16, and the sum of the first four is 1, so total sum is 1 + 16 = 17. Okay, that matches my earlier result. So, my initial alternative approach was wrong because I thought the next four terms were just double the sum of the first four, but actually, each term is double, so the sum of the next four terms is ( 2^4 ) times the sum of the first four terms. Wait, no, that's not exactly right.Wait, let me clarify. The sum of the first four terms is ( S_4 = a + 2a + 4a + 8a = 15a ). The sum of the next four terms is ( 16a + 32a + 64a + 128a = 240a ). So, ( 240a ) is equal to ( 16a times 15 ), which is 240a. So, if ( a = frac{1}{15} ), then ( 240a = 240 times frac{1}{15} = 16 ). So, the sum of the next four terms is 16, so total sum is 1 + 16 = 17. So, that makes sense.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the sum of the first eight terms is the sum of the first four terms plus the sum of the next four terms. Since each term in the next four is double the corresponding term in the first four, the sum of the next four terms is ( 2^4 times ) sum of the first four terms. Because each term is multiplied by 2, and there are four terms, so the total sum is multiplied by ( 2^4 = 16 ). So, the sum of the next four terms is ( 16 times 1 = 16 ), so total sum is ( 1 + 16 = 17 ). That also gives the same result.So, both methods give me 17, so I think that's correct. Therefore, the sum of the first eight terms is 17.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute the sum manually. If ( a = frac{1}{15} ), then the first eight terms are:1st term: ( frac{1}{15} )2nd term: ( frac{2}{15} )3rd term: ( frac{4}{15} )4th term: ( frac{8}{15} )5th term: ( frac{16}{15} )6th term: ( frac{32}{15} )7th term: ( frac{64}{15} )8th term: ( frac{128}{15} )Now, let's add them up:First four terms: ( frac{1}{15} + frac{2}{15} + frac{4}{15} + frac{8}{15} = frac{15}{15} = 1 ). That's correct.Next four terms: ( frac{16}{15} + frac{32}{15} + frac{64}{15} + frac{128}{15} ). Let's compute each addition step by step.16 + 32 = 4848 + 64 = 112112 + 128 = 240So, the sum is ( frac{240}{15} = 16 ). Therefore, total sum is 1 + 16 = 17. Yep, that's consistent.So, I think 17 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the sum of the first eight terms is 17.**Final Answer**The sum of the first eight terms equals to boxed{17}."},{"question":"A sequence of numbers 7^{1}, 7^{2}, 7^{3}, …, 7^{2001}, among them, the number of terms whose last digit is 3 is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find out how many terms in the sequence 7¹, 7², 7³, ..., 7²⁰⁰¹ have their last digit as 3. Hmm, interesting. I remember that the last digit of powers cycles in a pattern, so maybe I can figure out the pattern for powers of 7 and see when the last digit is 3.Let me start by calculating the first few powers of 7 and noting their last digits. That should help me see if there's a repeating cycle.7¹ = 7. The last digit is 7.7² = 49. The last digit is 9.7³ = 343. The last digit is 3.7⁴ = 2401. The last digit is 1.7⁵ = 16807. The last digit is 7.Wait a second, that's the same as 7¹. So does this mean the cycle repeats every 4 terms? Let me check 7⁶ just to be sure.7⁶ = 7⁵ × 7 = 16807 × 7. Let me compute that: 16807 × 7. 16807 × 7 is 117649. The last digit is 9. Yep, same as 7².So the cycle is 7, 9, 3, 1, and then repeats. So every 4 exponents, the last digit cycles through 7, 9, 3, 1.So, in each cycle of 4 exponents, the last digit is 3 exactly once, right? That's at the third position in the cycle.So, if the cycle is 4, then in every block of 4 exponents, there's one term ending with 3.So, to find how many such terms there are from 7¹ to 7²⁰⁰¹, I need to figure out how many complete cycles of 4 there are in 2001 exponents, and then see if there are any remaining terms that might also end with 3.First, let me compute how many complete cycles of 4 are in 2001. That would be 2001 divided by 4.2001 ÷ 4. Let me do that division. 4 × 500 is 2000, so 2001 ÷ 4 is 500 with a remainder of 1. So, 500 complete cycles and 1 extra term.Each complete cycle contributes 1 term ending with 3. So, 500 cycles would give 500 terms ending with 3.Now, the extra term is the 2001st term, which is 7²⁰⁰¹. Since the cycle is 4, the exponent 2001 corresponds to the position in the cycle as follows: 2001 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 1, right? Because 2000 is divisible by 4, so 2001 is 2000 + 1, which is 1 more than a multiple of 4. So, the remainder is 1.Looking back at the cycle, the first position is 7, second is 9, third is 3, fourth is 1. So, a remainder of 1 corresponds to the first position, which is 7. So, the last digit of 7²⁰⁰¹ is 7, not 3.Therefore, the extra term doesn't contribute any additional term ending with 3.So, the total number of terms ending with 3 is 500.Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, 2001 divided by 4 is 500 with a remainder of 1. So, 500 cycles, each contributing 1 term, so 500 terms. The remainder is 1, which is the first term of the next cycle, which is 7, so no extra 3s. So, 500 is the answer.But let me double-check by looking at smaller exponents to see if the pattern holds.For example, let's take exponents 1 to 4:7¹: 77²: 97³: 37⁴: 1So, one term ending with 3.Exponents 1 to 8:7⁵: 77⁶: 97⁷: 37⁸: 1So, another term ending with 3. So, total of 2 terms ending with 3.Similarly, exponents 1 to 12 would have 3 terms ending with 3, and so on.So, for every 4 exponents, we get one term ending with 3. So, for 2000 exponents, which is 500 cycles, we get 500 terms ending with 3. Then, the 2001st exponent is an extra term, which doesn't add another 3.Hence, the number of terms ending with 3 is 500.Wait, but let me think again. The exponents start at 1, so 7¹ is the first term. So, in the first cycle, exponents 1-4, we have one term ending with 3. Then exponents 5-8, another term, and so on.So, for exponent n, the position in the cycle is (n mod 4). If n mod 4 is 3, then the last digit is 3. So, the exponents where the last digit is 3 are those where n ≡ 3 mod 4.So, we need to find the number of integers n between 1 and 2001 inclusive such that n ≡ 3 mod 4.So, how many numbers between 1 and 2001 are congruent to 3 modulo 4?Well, the numbers are 3, 7, 11, ..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 2001.What's the largest number less than or equal to 2001 that is congruent to 3 mod 4?Well, 2001 divided by 4 is 500 with a remainder of 1. So, 4×500 = 2000, which is 0 mod 4. So, 2000 + 3 = 2003, which is beyond 2001. So, the previous one is 2000 -1 = 1999. 1999 divided by 4 is 499.75, so 4×499=1996, so 1996 +3=1999.So, the numbers are 3,7,11,...,1999.This is an arithmetic sequence with first term 3, common difference 4, last term 1999.The number of terms in this sequence can be found by:Number of terms = ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1So, ((1999 - 3)/4) +1 = (1996 /4) +1 = 499 +1 = 500.So, that's 500 terms. So, that confirms the earlier result.Therefore, the number of terms whose last digit is 3 is 500.I think that's solid. I approached it two ways: one by looking at cycles and counting the number of cycles, and another by considering the arithmetic sequence of exponents that satisfy the condition. Both methods gave me 500. So, I feel confident that 500 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The number of terms whose last digit is 3 is boxed{500}."},{"question":"In isosceles triangle triangle ABC we have AB=AC=4.  The altitude from B meets overline{AC} at H.  If AH=3(HC) then determine BC.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an isosceles triangle ABC where AB equals AC, both are 4 units long. The altitude from point B meets AC at point H, and it's given that AH is three times HC. I need to find the length of BC. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.First, since ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC, that means the triangle is symmetric with respect to the altitude from A. But wait, the altitude mentioned here is from point B, not from A. So, maybe I should draw triangle ABC with AB and AC both equal to 4. Let me sketch this mentally: point A at the top, B and C at the base, but since AB = AC, it's actually a triangle where sides AB and AC are equal, so the base is BC.Wait, no, hold on. If AB = AC, then the base is BC, and the two equal sides are AB and AC. So, the altitude from B would drop down to AC, hitting it at point H. So, point H is somewhere on AC, and AH is three times HC. So, AC is divided by H into segments AH and HC, where AH = 3 * HC.Since AC is 4, let me denote HC as x. Then AH would be 3x, and since AH + HC = AC, which is 4, we have 3x + x = 4, so 4x = 4, which means x = 1. Therefore, HC is 1 and AH is 3. So, point H divides AC into segments of 3 and 1.Now, the altitude from B to AC is BH, which is perpendicular to AC. So, triangle ABH and triangle CBH are both right triangles. Let me note that down.In triangle ABH, we have side AH = 3, AB = 4, and BH is the altitude. So, using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find BH.Wait, hold on, is triangle ABH a right triangle? Yes, because BH is an altitude, so it is perpendicular to AC, making angle at H a right angle. So, triangle ABH is a right triangle with legs AH = 3 and BH, and hypotenuse AB = 4.So, applying Pythagoras:AB² = AH² + BH²Which is:4² = 3² + BH²16 = 9 + BH²So, BH² = 16 - 9 = 7Therefore, BH = sqrt(7). Okay, so the length of the altitude BH is sqrt(7).Now, we need to find BC. Hmm, how can we find BC? Let me think.Since H is on AC, and we know HC = 1, and BH is the altitude, which is sqrt(7). So, in triangle CBH, which is also a right triangle, we have HC = 1, BH = sqrt(7), and BC is the hypotenuse.Wait, is triangle CBH a right triangle? Yes, because BH is perpendicular to AC, so angle at H is right. So, triangle CBH is a right triangle with legs HC = 1 and BH = sqrt(7), so BC can be found using Pythagoras as well.So, BC² = BH² + HC²Plugging in the values:BC² = (sqrt(7))² + 1² = 7 + 1 = 8Therefore, BC = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). Hmm, that seems straightforward.Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes I might mix up the sides.So, starting again: ABC is isosceles with AB = AC = 4. The altitude from B meets AC at H, with AH = 3*HC. So, AC is 4, so AH = 3, HC = 1.In triangle ABH, right-angled at H: AB = 4, AH = 3, so BH = sqrt(AB² - AH²) = sqrt(16 - 9) = sqrt(7). That's correct.Then, in triangle CBH, right-angled at H: HC = 1, BH = sqrt(7), so BC = sqrt(HC² + BH²) = sqrt(1 + 7) = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). That seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using coordinate geometry to verify.Let me place point A at (0, 0). Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC = 4, and base BC, let me place point B at (b, c) and point C at (-b, c) to maintain symmetry. Wait, but in this case, the altitude from B is to AC, which is from point B to AC. Hmm, maybe coordinate geometry will complicate things, but let's try.Let me assign coordinates:Let’s place point A at (0, 0). Since AC is 4 units, and H divides AC into AH = 3 and HC = 1, so point H is 3 units from A and 1 unit from C. So, if I place AC along the x-axis, point A is at (0, 0), point C is at (4, 0). Then, point H is at (3, 0).Wait, but in the problem, the altitude is from B to AC, so point B is somewhere above AC, and BH is perpendicular to AC, hitting at H (3, 0). So, point B has coordinates (3, h), where h is the height BH, which we found earlier as sqrt(7). So, point B is at (3, sqrt(7)).But wait, in this coordinate system, AB is the distance from A(0,0) to B(3, sqrt(7)). Let me compute AB:AB = sqrt((3 - 0)^2 + (sqrt(7) - 0)^2) = sqrt(9 + 7) = sqrt(16) = 4. Perfect, that matches the given AB = 4.Similarly, AC is from (0,0) to (4,0), which is 4 units, as given.Now, point C is at (4, 0), and point B is at (3, sqrt(7)). So, BC is the distance between (3, sqrt(7)) and (4, 0).Calculating BC:BC = sqrt((4 - 3)^2 + (0 - sqrt(7))^2) = sqrt(1 + 7) = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). So, same result as before.Therefore, it seems consistent. So, BC is 2*sqrt(2).Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem, maybe using similar triangles or trigonometry?Alternatively, since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the altitude from A would bisect BC. But in this problem, the altitude is from B, not from A. So, maybe we can relate the two.But perhaps it's more straightforward as I did earlier. Since I have consistent results from two different methods—Pythagoras and coordinate geometry—I think the answer is correct.So, summarizing:1. AC is divided by H into AH = 3 and HC = 1.2. In right triangle ABH, BH is sqrt(7).3. In right triangle CBH, BC is sqrt(1 + 7) = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2).Therefore, BC = 2*sqrt(2).**Final Answer**The length of BC is boxed{2sqrt{2}}."},{"question":"A tourist goes on a hike from point A to point B and back, completing the whole journey in 3 hours and 41 minutes. The road from A to B first goes uphill, then over flat ground, and finally downhill. What is the distance over the flat ground if the tourist's speeds are 4 km/h uphill, 5 km/h on flat ground, and 6 km/h downhill, and the distance mathrm{AB} is 9 km?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where a tourist is hiking from point A to point B and then back to A. The whole journey takes 3 hours and 41 minutes. The path from A to B has three parts: uphill, flat ground, and downhill. The tourist's speeds are different for each part: 4 km/h uphill, 5 km/h on flat ground, and 6 km/h downhill. The total distance from A to B is 9 km. I need to find the distance over the flat ground.Hmm, let me break this down. So, the journey is from A to B and back to A, which means the total distance is twice the distance from A to B, right? So, that's 9 km each way, making it 18 km in total. But wait, the time taken is 3 hours and 41 minutes. Let me convert that into hours to make calculations easier. 41 minutes is 41/60 hours, which is approximately 0.6833 hours. So, total time is 3 + 0.6833 = 3.6833 hours.Now, the path from A to B has uphill, flat, and downhill sections. Let me denote the distance uphill as 'x' km, the flat ground as 'y' km, and the downhill as 'z' km. Since the total distance from A to B is 9 km, we can write the equation:x + y + z = 9.When the tourist goes from A to B, he goes uphill, then flat, then downhill. So, his speeds for each segment are 4 km/h, 5 km/h, and 6 km/h respectively. On the way back from B to A, the uphill becomes downhill and vice versa. So, the return journey will have the same segments but in reverse: downhill, flat, uphill. Therefore, his speeds on the return trip will be 6 km/h downhill, 5 km/h flat, and 4 km/h uphill.So, the time taken for the entire journey is the sum of the time taken from A to B and the time taken from B to A.Let me write expressions for the time taken each way.From A to B:- Uphill: distance x, speed 4 km/h, so time = x / 4 hours.- Flat: distance y, speed 5 km/h, so time = y / 5 hours.- Downhill: distance z, speed 6 km/h, so time = z / 6 hours.Total time from A to B: (x/4) + (y/5) + (z/6).From B to A:- Downhill: distance x, speed 6 km/h, so time = x / 6 hours.- Flat: distance y, speed 5 km/h, so time = y / 5 hours.- Uphill: distance z, speed 4 km/h, so time = z / 4 hours.Total time from B to A: (x/6) + (y/5) + (z/4).Therefore, the total time for the round trip is:[(x/4) + (y/5) + (z/6)] + [(x/6) + (y/5) + (z/4)] = 3.6833 hours.Let me simplify this expression.First, combine the terms:For x: (x/4) + (x/6) = x*(1/4 + 1/6) = x*(3/12 + 2/12) = x*(5/12).For y: (y/5) + (y/5) = 2y/5.For z: (z/6) + (z/4) = z*(1/6 + 1/4) = z*(2/12 + 3/12) = z*(5/12).So, the total time equation becomes:(5x/12) + (2y/5) + (5z/12) = 3.6833.We also know from the first equation that x + y + z = 9.So, now we have two equations:1) x + y + z = 9.2) (5x/12) + (2y/5) + (5z/12) = 3.6833.Hmm, so we have two equations with three variables. That means we need another equation, but I don't see any more information given. Wait, maybe I can express x and z in terms of y or something.Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the equations to eliminate one variable.Let me see. Let me denote equation 1 as:x + y + z = 9. Let's call this equation (1).Equation 2 is:(5x/12) + (2y/5) + (5z/12) = 3.6833. Let's call this equation (2).I can try to express x and z in terms of y from equation (1). Let's see:From equation (1):x + z = 9 - y.So, x + z = 9 - y. Let me denote this as equation (3).Now, let's look at equation (2):(5x/12) + (2y/5) + (5z/12) = 3.6833.Notice that (5x/12) + (5z/12) can be factored as (5/12)(x + z).So, equation (2) becomes:(5/12)(x + z) + (2y)/5 = 3.6833.But from equation (3), x + z = 9 - y. So, substitute that into equation (2):(5/12)(9 - y) + (2y)/5 = 3.6833.Now, let's compute (5/12)(9 - y):First, 5/12 * 9 = (5*9)/12 = 45/12 = 3.75.Then, 5/12 * (-y) = -5y/12.So, equation (2) becomes:3.75 - (5y)/12 + (2y)/5 = 3.6833.Now, let's combine the y terms.We have -5y/12 + 2y/5.To combine these, find a common denominator. 12 and 5 have a common denominator of 60.Convert -5y/12 to -25y/60 and 2y/5 to 24y/60.So, -25y/60 + 24y/60 = (-25y + 24y)/60 = (-y)/60.So, equation (2) simplifies to:3.75 - y/60 = 3.6833.Now, let's solve for y.Subtract 3.75 from both sides:- y/60 = 3.6833 - 3.75.Compute 3.6833 - 3.75:3.6833 - 3.75 = -0.0667 approximately.So,- y/60 = -0.0667.Multiply both sides by -60:y = (-0.0667)*(-60) = 4.002.So, y is approximately 4 km.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check my calculations.So, starting from equation (2):(5x/12) + (2y/5) + (5z/12) = 3.6833.We expressed x + z as 9 - y, so (5/12)(9 - y) + (2y)/5 = 3.6833.Then, 5/12 * 9 is 45/12 = 3.75.5/12 * (-y) is -5y/12.So, 3.75 - 5y/12 + 2y/5 = 3.6833.Convert -5y/12 and 2y/5 to a common denominator of 60:-25y/60 + 24y/60 = (-25 + 24)y/60 = -y/60.So, 3.75 - y/60 = 3.6833.Subtract 3.75: - y/60 = -0.0667.Multiply both sides by -60: y = 4.002, which is approximately 4 km.So, y is approximately 4 km. Since the problem is likely set up with whole numbers, 4 km is probably the exact answer.Let me verify this.If y = 4 km, then from equation (1): x + z = 9 - 4 = 5 km.Now, let's compute the total time.From A to B:Time uphill: x / 4.Time flat: 4 / 5 = 0.8 hours.Time downhill: z / 6.From B to A:Time downhill: x / 6.Time flat: 4 / 5 = 0.8 hours.Time uphill: z / 4.Total time:(x/4 + 0.8 + z/6) + (x/6 + 0.8 + z/4) = (x/4 + x/6) + (z/6 + z/4) + 0.8 + 0.8.Compute x terms: x*(1/4 + 1/6) = x*(3/12 + 2/12) = x*(5/12).Compute z terms: z*(1/6 + 1/4) = z*(2/12 + 3/12) = z*(5/12).So, total time is (5x/12) + (5z/12) + 1.6.But x + z = 5, so (5/12)(x + z) = (5/12)*5 = 25/12 ≈ 2.0833 hours.Add the 1.6 hours from the flat sections: 2.0833 + 1.6 ≈ 3.6833 hours, which is exactly the total time given.So, that checks out. Therefore, y is indeed 4 km.Therefore, the distance over the flat ground is 4 km.**Final Answer**The distance over the flat ground is boxed{4} kilometers."},{"question":"The value of the determinant begin{vmatrix}4 & 1  2 & 5end{vmatrix} is ______.","answer":"To find the determinant of the 2x2 matrix, I'll use the formula for the determinant of a 2x2 matrix, which is ad minus bc.First, I'll identify the elements of the matrix:a = 4, b = 1, c = 2, d = 5.Next, I'll calculate the product of a and d: 4 multiplied by 5 equals 20.Then, I'll calculate the product of b and c: 1 multiplied by 2 equals 2.Finally, I'll subtract the second product from the first: 20 minus 2 equals 18.Therefore, the determinant of the matrix is 18."},{"question":"An arithmetic sequence with a common difference ( r ) is a sequence of numbers ( s_{0}, s_{1}, s_{2}, ldots ) that satisfies ( s_{k+1} = s_{k} + r ) for every index ( k ).

Express (log_{8} 14) in terms of (a).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Let (log_{14} 16) be equal to (a). I need to express (log_{8} 14) in terms of (a). Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but let me see if I can figure this out step by step.First, I know that logarithms can be converted from one base to another using the change of base formula. The formula is (log_{b} c = frac{log_{k} c}{log_{k} b}), where (k) is any positive number. Maybe I can use this to relate (log_{14} 16) and (log_{8} 14).Given that (log_{14} 16 = a), I can write this as:[a = frac{log 16}{log 14}]where the logs can be in any base, but I think using base 10 or base (e) (natural log) would work. Let me stick with base 10 for simplicity.So, (a = frac{log 16}{log 14}). I can rearrange this to solve for (log 16):[log 16 = a cdot log 14]Hmm, I need to find (log_{8} 14). Let me apply the change of base formula to this as well:[log_{8} 14 = frac{log 14}{log 8}]Okay, so if I can express (log 14) or (log 8) in terms of (a), I can substitute it into this equation.Looking back at the equation I had earlier: (log 16 = a cdot log 14). Maybe I can solve for (log 14) here:[log 14 = frac{log 16}{a}]So, substituting this into the expression for (log_{8} 14), I get:[log_{8} 14 = frac{frac{log 16}{a}}{log 8} = frac{log 16}{a cdot log 8}]Now, I need to see if I can express (log 16) and (log 8) in terms that might simplify or relate to each other.I know that 16 is (2^4) and 8 is (2^3). So, let me rewrite the logs:[log 16 = log (2^4) = 4 log 2][log 8 = log (2^3) = 3 log 2]Substituting these back into the equation:[log_{8} 14 = frac{4 log 2}{a cdot 3 log 2}]Ah, the (log 2) terms cancel out:[log_{8} 14 = frac{4}{3a}]So, that simplifies nicely. Therefore, (log_{8} 14) is equal to (frac{4}{3a}).Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Started with (log_{14} 16 = a), converted it using change of base to (frac{log 16}{log 14} = a).2. Solved for (log 16 = a cdot log 14).3. Then, for (log_{8} 14), used change of base again: (frac{log 14}{log 8}).4. Substituted (log 14 = frac{log 16}{a}) into that, resulting in (frac{log 16}{a cdot log 8}).5. Expressed (log 16) and (log 8) in terms of (log 2), which gave me (frac{4 log 2}{3 log 2 a}).6. Simplified by canceling (log 2), leading to (frac{4}{3a}).Everything seems to check out.

Two out of the three disks are defective. What is the probability that the defective disks are from companies mathrm{L} and mathrm{M}, given that the defect rates for companies mathrm{K}, mathrm{L}, and mathrm{M} are 10%, 20%, and 15%, respectively?","answer":"Alright, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.The user has three computer disks from companies K, L, and M. Each disk is from a different company, so one from K, one from L, and one from M. However, the company stamps are missing, so we don't know which disk is from which company. The important thing is that two out of these three disks are defective. We need to find the probability that the defective disks are from companies L and M, given their respective defect rates.The defect rates are 10% for K, 20% for L, and 15% for M. So, company K has the lowest defect rate, followed by M, and then L with the highest. I think this is a conditional probability problem. We need to find the probability that the two defective disks are from L and M, given that exactly two disks are defective. So, in probability terms, we're looking for P(defective disks are L and M | exactly two defective disks).To solve this, I should probably use Bayes' theorem or maybe just calculate the probabilities of each possible combination of defective disks and then find the ratio for the specific case we're interested in.Let me outline the possible scenarios where exactly two disks are defective. Since there are three disks, the number of ways to choose two defective disks is C(3,2) = 3. So, the possible pairs are:1. K and L defective2. K and M defective3. L and M defectiveWe need to find the probability that the third case (L and M defective) occurs, given that exactly two disks are defective.So, the formula for conditional probability is:P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)In this case, event A is \\"defective disks are L and M\\" and event B is \\"exactly two disks are defective.\\" Since if A happens, B must happen, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, we can write:P(L and M defective | exactly two defective) = P(L and M defective) / P(exactly two defective)Therefore, I need to calculate two things:1. The probability that L and M are defective.2. The total probability that exactly two disks are defective.Let's start with the first part: P(L and M defective). Since the disks are independent, the probability that both L and M are defective is the product of their individual defect probabilities. So:P(L defective) = 20% = 0.2P(M defective) = 15% = 0.15P(L and M defective) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03But wait, hold on. Since we have three disks, and we're considering exactly two defective, we also need to consider the probability that the third disk (K) is not defective. Because if we're considering exactly two defective disks, the third one must be good.So, actually, P(L and M defective and K good) = P(L defective) * P(M defective) * P(K good)Similarly, for the other cases.So, I think I made a mistake earlier. I need to include the probability that the third disk is not defective in each case.So, let me correct that.First, let's define:P(K defective) = 0.1, so P(K good) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9P(L defective) = 0.2, so P(L good) = 0.8P(M defective) = 0.15, so P(M good) = 0.85Now, for each pair of defective disks, we need to calculate the probability that those two are defective and the third is good.So, for the three cases:1. K and L defective, M good: P(K defective) * P(L defective) * P(M good) = 0.1 * 0.2 * 0.852. K and M defective, L good: P(K defective) * P(M defective) * P(L good) = 0.1 * 0.15 * 0.83. L and M defective, K good: P(L defective) * P(M defective) * P(K good) = 0.2 * 0.15 * 0.9Calculating each:1. 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02; 0.02 * 0.85 = 0.0172. 0.1 * 0.15 = 0.015; 0.015 * 0.8 = 0.0123. 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03; 0.03 * 0.9 = 0.027So, the probabilities for each case are:1. 0.0172. 0.0123. 0.027Therefore, the total probability of exactly two defective disks is the sum of these three:Total P = 0.017 + 0.012 + 0.027 = 0.056So, P(exactly two defective) = 0.056Now, the probability that the defective disks are L and M is 0.027, as calculated in case 3.Therefore, the conditional probability is:P(L and M defective | exactly two defective) = 0.027 / 0.056Let me compute that:0.027 divided by 0.056.Well, 0.027 / 0.056 is equal to 27/56 when multiplied numerator and denominator by 1000.Simplify 27/56: 27 and 56 have no common factors besides 1, so it's 27/56.27 divided by 56 is approximately 0.4821, so about 48.21%.But since the question asks for the probability, we can leave it as a fraction.So, 27/56 is the probability.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.First, P(K and L defective, M good): 0.1 * 0.2 * 0.850.1 * 0.2 is 0.02, 0.02 * 0.85 is 0.017. Correct.P(K and M defective, L good): 0.1 * 0.15 * 0.80.1 * 0.15 is 0.015, 0.015 * 0.8 is 0.012. Correct.P(L and M defective, K good): 0.2 * 0.15 * 0.90.2 * 0.15 is 0.03, 0.03 * 0.9 is 0.027. Correct.Total: 0.017 + 0.012 + 0.027 = 0.056. Correct.So, 0.027 / 0.056 = 27/56. Yes, that's correct.So, the probability is 27/56.Wait, but let me think again: is there another way to approach this problem?Alternatively, since the disks are from different companies, and we don't know which is which, perhaps we can model this as assigning each disk to a company and then computing the probabilities.But in this case, since we have one disk from each company, and we don't know which is which, but we know that two are defective. So, the problem is similar to having three items, each with a different probability of being defective, and we want the probability that the two defective ones are from L and M.Wait, actually, that's exactly what we did earlier.So, perhaps my initial approach is correct.Alternatively, another way is to think of all possible assignments of companies to disks, but since each disk is uniquely from a company, and we don't know which is which, but we know that two are defective.Wait, but in this case, the company stamps are absent, so we don't know which disk is from which company. So, we have three disks, each from K, L, M, but we don't know which is which, and two are defective.So, the problem is similar to: given three items with known individual probabilities of being defective, and we know that exactly two are defective, what's the probability that the two defective ones are from L and M.Which is exactly the same as what I computed earlier.Therefore, I think 27/56 is the correct answer.But just to make sure, let me try to compute it another way.Suppose we consider all possible combinations of defective disks. Since there are three disks, each can be defective or not. But we are given that exactly two are defective.So, the sample space is all possible ways to have exactly two defective disks. Each of these has a certain probability, and we need to find the probability that the two defective disks are L and M.So, the number of possible ways is 3, as we had earlier: {K, L}, {K, M}, {L, M}.Each of these has a probability, which we calculated as 0.017, 0.012, and 0.027 respectively.Therefore, the probability of {L, M} is 0.027, and the total probability is 0.056, so the conditional probability is 0.027 / 0.056 = 27/56.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, if I think in terms of odds, the odds of {L, M} defective compared to the other possibilities.But I think the way I did it is correct.So, in conclusion, the probability that the defective disks are from L and M, given that exactly two disks are defective, is 27/56.**Final Answer**The probability is boxed{dfrac{27}{56}}."},{"question":"If a sequence {a_n} satisfies frac {1}{a_{n+1}}- frac {1}{a_{n}}=d (where ninmathbb{N}^*, d is a constant), then the sequence {a_n} is called a \\"harmonic sequence\\". Given that the sequence {frac {1}{x_{n}}} is a \\"harmonic sequence\\", and x_1+x_2+ldots+x_{20}=200, the maximum value of x_3x_{18} is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a harmonic sequence. Let me first make sure I understand what a harmonic sequence is. The problem says that if a sequence {a_n} satisfies 1/a_{n+1} - 1/a_n = d, where d is a constant, then it's called a harmonic sequence. So, essentially, the reciprocals of the terms form an arithmetic sequence with common difference d. That makes sense because in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant, so here the difference of the reciprocals is constant.Given that, the problem states that the sequence {1/x_n} is a harmonic sequence. Wait, hold on, if {1/x_n} is a harmonic sequence, then according to the definition, that would mean that 1/(1/x_{n+1}) - 1/(1/x_n) = d. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.If {1/x_n} is a harmonic sequence, then according to the definition, 1/(1/x_{n+1}) - 1/(1/x_n) = d. But 1/(1/x_{n}) is just x_n, so that would mean x_{n+1} - x_n = d. So, actually, the sequence {x_n} is an arithmetic sequence with common difference d. Hmm, that seems interesting. So, if {1/x_n} is a harmonic sequence, then {x_n} is an arithmetic sequence.Let me write that down:Given {1/x_n} is a harmonic sequence, so:1/(1/x_{n+1}) - 1/(1/x_n) = d => x_{n+1} - x_n = d.Therefore, {x_n} is an arithmetic sequence with common difference d.So, that simplifies things. So, x_n is an arithmetic sequence. So, x_n = x_1 + (n - 1)d.Given that, we have x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_{20} = 200.Since it's an arithmetic sequence, the sum of the first n terms is n/2*(2a + (n - 1)d), where a is the first term. So, in this case, the sum S_{20} = 20/2*(2x_1 + 19d) = 10*(2x_1 + 19d) = 200.So, 10*(2x_1 + 19d) = 200 => 2x_1 + 19d = 20.So, 2x_1 + 19d = 20. Let's note that as equation (1).Now, we need to find the maximum value of x_3 * x_{18}.Since x_n is an arithmetic sequence, x_3 = x_1 + 2d and x_{18} = x_1 + 17d.So, x_3 * x_{18} = (x_1 + 2d)(x_1 + 17d).We need to maximize this expression given that 2x_1 + 19d = 20.So, perhaps we can express x_1 in terms of d or vice versa, and then write the product as a function of a single variable and find its maximum.Let me solve equation (1) for x_1:2x_1 + 19d = 20 => 2x_1 = 20 - 19d => x_1 = (20 - 19d)/2.So, x_1 = 10 - (19/2)d.Now, plug this into x_3 and x_{18}:x_3 = x_1 + 2d = 10 - (19/2)d + 2d = 10 - (19/2 - 4/2)d = 10 - (15/2)d.Similarly, x_{18} = x_1 + 17d = 10 - (19/2)d + 17d = 10 + ( -19/2 + 34/2 )d = 10 + (15/2)d.So, x_3 = 10 - (15/2)d and x_{18} = 10 + (15/2)d.Therefore, the product x_3 * x_{18} = [10 - (15/2)d][10 + (15/2)d].This looks like a difference of squares: (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2.So, let's compute that:(10)^2 - [(15/2)d]^2 = 100 - (225/4)d^2.So, x_3 * x_{18} = 100 - (225/4)d^2.We need to maximize this expression. Since it's a quadratic in terms of d^2, and the coefficient of d^2 is negative, the expression is a downward-opening parabola, so it has a maximum at the vertex.But wait, actually, since it's in terms of d^2, it's a quadratic in d^2, so it's a downward-opening parabola in terms of d^2, which means it's maximum at the smallest possible d^2. Wait, but d can be any real number, but we have constraints on x_n.Wait, but hold on, in the context of the problem, the sequence {x_n} must be such that all terms are defined. Since {1/x_n} is a harmonic sequence, which is an arithmetic sequence in reciprocals, so 1/x_n must be defined, meaning x_n cannot be zero. So, x_n ≠ 0 for all n.Additionally, since {1/x_n} is an arithmetic sequence, the terms 1/x_n must be defined, so x_n ≠ 0. So, in our arithmetic sequence {x_n}, all terms must be non-zero. So, we need to ensure that x_n ≠ 0 for all n.Given that, x_n = x_1 + (n - 1)d ≠ 0 for any n.So, in our case, n goes up to 20, so we need x_1 + (n - 1)d ≠ 0 for n = 1, 2, ..., 20.So, x_1 + (n - 1)d ≠ 0 for all n from 1 to 20.Given that, we can't have any term x_n equal to zero. So, we have to ensure that x_1 + (n - 1)d ≠ 0 for n = 1, 2, ..., 20.But since x_1 is expressed in terms of d as x_1 = 10 - (19/2)d, we can plug that in:10 - (19/2)d + (n - 1)d ≠ 0 for n = 1, 2, ..., 20.Simplify:10 - (19/2)d + (n - 1)d = 10 + [ (n - 1) - 19/2 ]d.Let me compute the coefficient of d:(n - 1) - 19/2 = (2(n - 1) - 19)/2 = (2n - 2 - 19)/2 = (2n - 21)/2.So, 10 + (2n - 21)/2 * d ≠ 0.So, for each n from 1 to 20, 10 + [(2n - 21)/2]d ≠ 0.So, for each n, [(2n - 21)/2]d ≠ -10.So, d ≠ (-10) * [2 / (2n - 21)] for n = 1, 2, ..., 20.So, d ≠ (-20)/(2n - 21) for each n.So, we need to ensure that d is not equal to (-20)/(2n - 21) for any n from 1 to 20.But let's see what 2n - 21 is for n from 1 to 20.When n = 1: 2(1) - 21 = -19n=2: 4 -21=-17n=3:6-21=-15...n=10:20-21=-1n=11:22-21=1n=12:24-21=3...n=20:40-21=19So, 2n -21 ranges from -19 to 19, excluding 0, as n goes from 1 to 20.Therefore, d ≠ (-20)/k where k is an odd integer from -19 to 19, excluding 0.So, d cannot be equal to 20/19, 20/17, ..., 20/1, -20/1, -20/3, ..., -20/19.So, d must not be equal to any of those values.But in our problem, we are to find the maximum of x_3 x_{18} = 100 - (225/4)d^2.Since this is a quadratic function in terms of d^2, and the coefficient of d^2 is negative, the maximum occurs at the smallest possible |d|, but wait, actually, since it's 100 minus something, to maximize the expression, we need to minimize the subtracted term, which is (225/4)d^2. So, the smaller d^2 is, the larger the product x_3 x_{18} is.Therefore, the maximum occurs when d = 0.But wait, if d = 0, then x_n is a constant sequence, since x_{n+1} - x_n = 0. So, all x_n are equal to x_1.But then, the sum x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_{20} = 20x_1 = 200, so x_1 = 10.Therefore, x_n = 10 for all n.Therefore, x_3 = 10, x_{18} = 10, so x_3 x_{18} = 100.But wait, if d = 0, then {1/x_n} is a harmonic sequence with d = 0. So, 1/x_{n+1} - 1/x_n = 0, meaning 1/x_n is constant, so x_n is constant. So, that's acceptable.But hold on, is d allowed to be zero? Let me check the problem statement.It says \\"where n ∈ N^*\\", which is the set of positive integers, and \\"d is a constant\\". It doesn't specify that d is non-zero, so d can be zero. So, d = 0 is allowed.Therefore, the maximum value of x_3 x_{18} is 100.But wait, let me think again. If d = 0, then x_n = 10 for all n, so x_3 x_{18} = 10*10=100.But if d is not zero, then x_3 x_{18} = 100 - (225/4)d^2, which is less than 100 because (225/4)d^2 is positive. So, indeed, the maximum occurs at d = 0, giving 100.But hold on, is there any restriction on d? Because if d is too large, some x_n could become zero or negative, but in our earlier analysis, we saw that x_n must not be zero, but they can be positive or negative as long as they are non-zero.Wait, but in the problem statement, is there any restriction on x_n? It just says that {1/x_n} is a harmonic sequence, and the sum of x_1 to x_{20} is 200.So, x_n can be positive or negative, as long as they are non-zero. So, for example, if d is positive, x_n could increase without bound, but if d is negative, x_n could decrease.But in our case, since x_3 and x_{18} are terms in the middle of the sequence, if d is positive, x_3 is smaller than x_{18}, and if d is negative, x_3 is larger than x_{18}.But in any case, the product x_3 x_{18} is 100 - (225/4)d^2, which is maximized when d = 0.But let me check if d can actually be zero. If d = 0, then {x_n} is a constant sequence, so {1/x_n} is also a constant sequence, which is a harmonic sequence with d = 0. So, that's acceptable.But wait, let me make sure that the problem doesn't have any hidden constraints. The problem says that {1/x_n} is a harmonic sequence, so as long as 1/x_{n+1} - 1/x_n is constant, which is satisfied when x_n is constant, so d = 0 is allowed.Therefore, the maximum value of x_3 x_{18} is 100.But wait, hold on, let me think again. If d is not zero, can x_3 x_{18} be larger than 100? Because 100 is achieved when d = 0, but if d is non-zero, the product is less than 100. So, 100 is indeed the maximum.But wait, let me test with a small d. Let's say d is very small, like d = 0.1.Then, x_1 = 10 - (19/2)(0.1) = 10 - 0.95 = 9.05.x_3 = 10 - (15/2)(0.1) = 10 - 0.75 = 9.25.x_{18} = 10 + (15/2)(0.1) = 10 + 0.75 = 10.75.So, x_3 x_{18} = 9.25 * 10.75 ≈ 99.6875, which is less than 100.Similarly, if d is negative, say d = -0.1.x_1 = 10 - (19/2)(-0.1) = 10 + 0.95 = 10.95.x_3 = 10 - (15/2)(-0.1) = 10 + 0.75 = 10.75.x_{18} = 10 + (15/2)(-0.1) = 10 - 0.75 = 9.25.So, x_3 x_{18} = 10.75 * 9.25 ≈ 99.6875, same as before.So, in both cases, the product is less than 100.Hence, 100 is indeed the maximum.But wait, hold on, let me think about another approach. Maybe using AM-GM inequality?We have x_3 and x_{18}, and we know that x_3 + x_{18} is fixed?Wait, no, actually, x_3 + x_{18} is not fixed. Let's compute x_3 + x_{18}.x_3 = 10 - (15/2)dx_{18} = 10 + (15/2)dSo, x_3 + x_{18} = 20.So, x_3 + x_{18} = 20.So, we have two numbers x_3 and x_{18} whose sum is 20, and we need to maximize their product.From AM-GM inequality, the maximum product occurs when the two numbers are equal, i.e., x_3 = x_{18} = 10.Which is exactly the case when d = 0.So, the maximum product is 10*10=100.Therefore, the maximum value of x_3 x_{18} is 100.So, I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**boxed{100}"},{"question":"Lolita has 54000 strawberry seeds.

I need to find the distance from point P to the focus of this parabola. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the standard form of a parabola can help me figure out its key features like the vertex, focus, and directrix. The given equation is y² = -12x. I recall that the standard form of a parabola that opens to the left or right is y² = 4px, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. If p is positive, it opens to the right; if p is negative, it opens to the left.Looking at the given equation, y² = -12x, I can compare it to y² = 4px. So, 4p must be equal to -12. Let me solve for p:4p = -12  p = -12 / 4  p = -3Okay, so p is -3. That means the parabola opens to the left, and the focus is 3 units to the left of the vertex. Since the vertex of this parabola is at the origin (0,0), the focus should be at (-3, 0). Got that down.Now, the problem says that point P is on the parabola and is at a distance of 1 from the y-axis. The distance from a point to the y-axis is the absolute value of its x-coordinate. So, if the distance is 1, the x-coordinate of point P is either 1 or -1. But wait, since the parabola is y² = -12x, let's see what x can be.Looking at the equation y² = -12x, since y² is always non-negative, the right side must also be non-negative. So, -12x ≥ 0. That implies that x ≤ 0. Therefore, the x-coordinate of any point on this parabola must be less than or equal to zero. So, the x-coordinate can't be 1 because that would be positive. Therefore, the x-coordinate must be -1.So, point P has an x-coordinate of -1. Let me write that down: x = -1. Now, I need to find the corresponding y-coordinate(s) for this x on the parabola.Plugging x = -1 into the equation y² = -12x:y² = -12*(-1)  y² = 12  So, y = ±√12  Simplify √12: √12 = 2√3Therefore, the coordinates of point P are (-1, 2√3) and (-1, -2√3). Since the problem doesn't specify which one, I think both points will have the same distance to the focus, so it doesn't matter which one I choose.Now, I need to find the distance from point P to the focus. Earlier, I found that the focus is at (-3, 0). So, let's take point P as (-1, 2√3) and calculate the distance between (-1, 2√3) and (-3, 0).I remember the distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]. Let me apply that here.So, plugging in the coordinates:Distance = √[(-3 - (-1))² + (0 - 2√3)²]  Simplify inside the square roots:First, (-3 - (-1)) = (-3 + 1) = -2  Second, (0 - 2√3) = -2√3So, the distance becomes:√[(-2)² + (-2√3)²]  Calculate each term:(-2)² = 4  (-2√3)² = (4)*(3) = 12So, adding them together:4 + 12 = 16Therefore, the distance is √16 = 4.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, point P is (-1, 2√3) and the focus is (-3, 0). The difference in x-coordinates is (-3) - (-1) = -2, and the difference in y-coordinates is 0 - 2√3 = -2√3. Squaring both gives 4 and 12, adding to 16, square root is 4. That seems correct.Alternatively, if I had chosen the other point (-1, -2√3), the distance would be the same because squaring the y-difference would still give 12. So, either way, the distance is 4.Just to recap:1. Given parabola y² = -12x, which is a left-opening parabola.2. Calculated p = -3, so focus at (-3, 0).3. Point P is 1 unit from y-axis, so x = -1.4. Plugged x = -1 into parabola equation to get y = ±2√3.5. Calculated distance from (-1, 2√3) to (-3, 0) using distance formula, got 4.I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my steps. So, the distance from point P to the focus is 4 units.**Final Answer**The distance from point ( P ) to the focus of the parabola is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Given the line sqrt{2}ax+by=2 (where a and b are non-zero real numbers) intersects the circle x^2+y^2=1 at points A and B, and O is the origin, with triangle AOB being a right-angled triangle, the minimum value of frac{1}{a^2} + frac{2}{b^2} is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: the line √2 a x + b y = 2 intersects the circle x² + y² = 1 at points A and B. O is the origin, and triangle AOB is a right-angled triangle. I need to find the minimum value of 1/a² + 2/b². Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the problem. There's a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. The line √2 a x + b y = 2 intersects this circle at two points, A and B. The triangle formed by points A, O, and B is right-angled. So, one of the angles at O, A, or B is 90 degrees.Since O is the origin, and A and B are points on the circle, OA and OB are both radii of the circle, so they have length 1. So, OA = OB = 1. If triangle AOB is right-angled, then the right angle must be at O, A, or B. But since OA and OB are both radii, if the right angle is at O, then OA and OB are perpendicular. If the right angle is at A or B, then OA is perpendicular to AB or OB is perpendicular to AB, respectively.Wait, but OA and OB are both radii, so if the right angle is at O, then OA is perpendicular to OB, meaning that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. That would mean that the dot product of vectors OA and OB is zero. So, if A is (x1, y1) and B is (x2, y2), then x1 x2 + y1 y2 = 0.Alternatively, if the right angle is at A or B, then the vectors OA and AB or OB and AB would be perpendicular. That might complicate things a bit more, but maybe starting with the right angle at O is simpler.So, let's first assume that the right angle is at O. Then, OA is perpendicular to OB, so x1 x2 + y1 y2 = 0.Given that A and B lie on the circle x² + y² = 1, so x1² + y1² = 1 and x2² + y2² = 1.Also, both A and B lie on the line √2 a x + b y = 2. So, substituting A and B into the line equation, we have √2 a x1 + b y1 = 2 and √2 a x2 + b y2 = 2.So, we have four equations:1. x1² + y1² = 12. x2² + y2² = 13. √2 a x1 + b y1 = 24. √2 a x2 + b y2 = 2And also, x1 x2 + y1 y2 = 0.Hmm, okay, so that's a lot of equations. Maybe I can find a relationship between x1 and x2, or y1 and y2.Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the line intersecting the circle. The line √2 a x + b y = 2 intersects the circle x² + y² = 1. So, maybe I can find the points of intersection by solving these two equations.Let me try to solve for y from the line equation: y = (2 - √2 a x)/b.Substitute this into the circle equation: x² + [(2 - √2 a x)/b]^2 = 1.Expanding this, we get x² + (4 - 4√2 a x + 2 a² x²)/b² = 1.Multiply through by b² to eliminate the denominator: b² x² + 4 - 4√2 a x + 2 a² x² = b².Bring all terms to one side: (b² + 2 a²) x² - 4√2 a x + (4 - b²) = 0.So, this is a quadratic in x: (2 a² + b²) x² - 4√2 a x + (4 - b²) = 0.Let me denote this as A x² + B x + C = 0, where:A = 2 a² + b²B = -4√2 aC = 4 - b²Now, since the line intersects the circle at two points A and B, this quadratic has two real solutions. So, the discriminant must be positive.Discriminant D = B² - 4AC = (16 * 2 a²) - 4*(2 a² + b²)*(4 - b²).Compute D: 32 a² - 4*(2 a² + b²)*(4 - b²).Hmm, maybe I don't need to compute this right now. Alternatively, since points A and B lie on both the line and the circle, their coordinates satisfy both equations.Also, since OA and OB are perpendicular, x1 x2 + y1 y2 = 0.From quadratic equation, the product of roots x1 x2 = C/A = (4 - b²)/(2 a² + b²).Similarly, the sum of roots x1 + x2 = -B/A = (4√2 a)/(2 a² + b²).But we need y1 y2. Since y = (2 - √2 a x)/b, so y1 = (2 - √2 a x1)/b and y2 = (2 - √2 a x2)/b.So, y1 y2 = [(2 - √2 a x1)(2 - √2 a x2)] / b².Let me compute that:y1 y2 = [4 - 2√2 a (x1 + x2) + 2 a² x1 x2] / b².So, substituting x1 + x2 and x1 x2 from above:x1 + x2 = (4√2 a)/(2 a² + b²)x1 x2 = (4 - b²)/(2 a² + b²)So, plug these into y1 y2:y1 y2 = [4 - 2√2 a*(4√2 a/(2 a² + b²)) + 2 a²*(4 - b²)/(2 a² + b²)] / b²Simplify each term:First term: 4Second term: -2√2 a * (4√2 a)/(2 a² + b²) = -2√2 * 4√2 a² / (2 a² + b²) = -16 a² / (2 a² + b²)Third term: 2 a²*(4 - b²)/(2 a² + b²) = (8 a² - 2 a² b²)/(2 a² + b²)So, combining all terms:y1 y2 = [4 - 16 a²/(2 a² + b²) + (8 a² - 2 a² b²)/(2 a² + b²)] / b²Combine the terms in the numerator:First, write 4 as 4*(2 a² + b²)/(2 a² + b²) to have a common denominator.So, numerator becomes:4*(2 a² + b²) - 16 a² + 8 a² - 2 a² b²Compute each part:4*(2 a² + b²) = 8 a² + 4 b²Subtract 16 a²: 8 a² + 4 b² - 16 a² = -8 a² + 4 b²Add 8 a² - 2 a² b²: (-8 a² + 4 b²) + 8 a² - 2 a² b² = 4 b² - 2 a² b²So, numerator is 4 b² - 2 a² b² = 2 b² (2 - a²)Therefore, y1 y2 = [2 b² (2 - a²)] / [ (2 a² + b²) * b² ] = [2 (2 - a²)] / (2 a² + b²)So, y1 y2 = [2 (2 - a²)] / (2 a² + b²)Now, remember that x1 x2 + y1 y2 = 0.We have x1 x2 = (4 - b²)/(2 a² + b²)And y1 y2 = [2 (2 - a²)] / (2 a² + b²)So, adding them together:(4 - b²)/(2 a² + b²) + [2 (2 - a²)] / (2 a² + b²) = 0Combine the numerators:[4 - b² + 4 - 2 a²] / (2 a² + b²) = 0Simplify numerator:4 - b² + 4 - 2 a² = 8 - b² - 2 a²So, 8 - b² - 2 a² = 0Thus, 2 a² + b² = 8So, that's a key equation: 2 a² + b² = 8.So, now, we have this equation, and we need to find the minimum value of 1/a² + 2/b².So, let me denote S = 1/a² + 2/b².We have the constraint 2 a² + b² = 8.We need to minimize S subject to 2 a² + b² = 8.This seems like a problem that can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers, or perhaps using substitution.Alternatively, since it's symmetric in a way, maybe we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.Let me think about substitution.From the constraint, 2 a² + b² = 8, so we can express b² = 8 - 2 a².Then, substitute into S:S = 1/a² + 2/(8 - 2 a²) = 1/a² + 2/(8 - 2 a²)Simplify the second term: 2/(8 - 2 a²) = 2/(2*(4 - a²)) = 1/(4 - a²)So, S = 1/a² + 1/(4 - a²)So, now, S is a function of a². Let me denote t = a², so t > 0, and from the constraint, 2 t + b² = 8, so b² = 8 - 2 t, which must be positive, so 8 - 2 t > 0 => t < 4.So, t is in (0, 4).So, S(t) = 1/t + 1/(4 - t)We need to find the minimum of S(t) for t in (0, 4).To find the minimum, take the derivative of S(t) with respect to t and set it to zero.Compute S'(t):S'(t) = -1/t² + 1/(4 - t)²Set S'(t) = 0:-1/t² + 1/(4 - t)² = 0So, 1/(4 - t)² = 1/t²Take square roots (since both denominators are positive):1/(4 - t) = ±1/tBut since t is positive and less than 4, 4 - t is positive, so both denominators are positive, so we can ignore the negative case.Thus,1/(4 - t) = 1/tCross-multiplying:t = 4 - tSo, 2 t = 4 => t = 2So, critical point at t = 2.Now, check the second derivative or test intervals to ensure it's a minimum.Compute S''(t):S''(t) = 2/t³ + 2/(4 - t)³At t = 2, S''(2) = 2/(8) + 2/(8) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 > 0, so it's a minimum.Thus, the minimum occurs at t = 2.So, a² = 2, so a = ±√2.Then, b² = 8 - 2 a² = 8 - 4 = 4, so b = ±2.Thus, S = 1/a² + 2/b² = 1/2 + 2/4 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.So, the minimum value is 1.Wait, hold on, let me verify that. If a² = 2, then 1/a² = 1/2. If b² = 4, then 2/b² = 2/4 = 1/2. So, 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Yes, that's correct.But just to make sure, let me check if there are any other critical points or if the endpoints approach infinity.As t approaches 0+, S(t) approaches infinity. As t approaches 4-, S(t) approaches infinity. So, the only critical point is at t = 2, which is a minimum.Therefore, the minimum value of 1/a² + 2/b² is 1.Wait, but before I conclude, let me make sure that when a² = 2 and b² = 4, the line actually intersects the circle at two points such that triangle AOB is right-angled.So, let me check that.Given a² = 2, so a = √2 or -√2, and b² = 4, so b = 2 or -2.Let me take a = √2 and b = 2 for simplicity.Then, the line is √2 * √2 x + 2 y = 2 => 2 x + 2 y = 2 => x + y = 1.So, the line is x + y = 1.This intersects the circle x² + y² = 1.Let me find points A and B.Substitute y = 1 - x into the circle equation:x² + (1 - x)^2 = 1 => x² + 1 - 2x + x² = 1 => 2x² - 2x + 1 = 1 => 2x² - 2x = 0 => 2x(x - 1) = 0.So, x = 0 or x = 1.Thus, points are (0,1) and (1,0).So, points A and B are (0,1) and (1,0).Then, triangle AOB has vertices at (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0). Indeed, this is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at O, since OA is along the y-axis and OB is along the x-axis, which are perpendicular.So, that checks out.Therefore, the minimum value is indeed 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"In the ancient Chinese mathematical classic \\"Suan Fa Tong Zong\\", there is the following problem: \\"A seven-story tower stands tall and red lights adorn it, with a total of 381 lights. The number of lights on each adjacent lower layer is twice that of the upper layer. How many lights are there on the fourth layer?\\"","answer":"First, I need to understand the problem. There is a seven-story tower with a total of 381 red lights. Each lower layer has twice as many lights as the layer above it. I need to find the number of lights on the fourth layer.Since each layer has twice as many lights as the one above, this forms a geometric sequence where each term is double the previous one. Let's denote the number of lights on the first (top) layer as ( a ). Therefore, the number of lights on each subsequent layer can be expressed as:- 1st layer: ( a )- 2nd layer: ( 2a )- 3rd layer: ( 4a )- 4th layer: ( 8a )- 5th layer: ( 16a )- 6th layer: ( 32a )- 7th layer: ( 64a )The total number of lights is the sum of all these layers, which equals 381. So, the equation becomes:[ a + 2a + 4a + 8a + 16a + 32a + 64a = 381 ]Combining like terms, the sum of the coefficients is ( 127a ). Therefore:[ 127a = 381 ]Solving for ( a ):[ a = frac{381}{127} = 3 ]Now, to find the number of lights on the fourth layer, which is ( 8a ):[ 8a = 8 times 3 = 24 ]So, there are 24 lights on the fourth layer."},{"question":"If the algebraic expression 2(x^{2}-xy+y^{2})-(3x^{2}-axy+y^{2}) does not contain the term xy, then a=____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this algebraic expression: 2(x² - xy + y²) - (3x² - axy + y²). The problem says that this expression does not contain the term xy, and I need to find the value of a. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I should probably expand the expression step by step. That way, I can see all the terms clearly and figure out how the xy term behaves. Let me start by distributing the 2 into the first parentheses.So, 2 times (x² - xy + y²) would be 2*x² - 2*xy + 2*y². Let me write that down:2x² - 2xy + 2y².Now, the second part of the expression is subtracting (3x² - axy + y²). So, I need to distribute the negative sign to each term inside the parentheses. That would give me:-3x² + axy - y².Wait, let me double-check that. Yes, subtracting each term: -3x², then +axy because subtracting a negative would be positive, and -y². Okay, that seems right.Now, I'll combine the two parts together:2x² - 2xy + 2y² - 3x² + axy - y².Next, I should combine like terms. Let's group the x² terms, the xy terms, and the y² terms separately.Starting with the x² terms: 2x² - 3x². That simplifies to (2 - 3)x², which is -1x² or just -x².Now, the xy terms: -2xy + axy. That can be written as (-2 + a)xy.Lastly, the y² terms: 2y² - y². That simplifies to (2 - 1)y², which is y².Putting it all together, the simplified expression is:-x² + (-2 + a)xy + y².But the problem states that the expression does not contain the term xy. That means the coefficient of the xy term must be zero. So, I can set up the equation:-2 + a = 0.Solving for a, I just need to add 2 to both sides:-2 + a + 2 = 0 + 2,a = 2.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of xy is (-2 + a), and we need that to be zero. So, yes, -2 + a = 0 implies a = 2. That seems straightforward.Let me recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. I expanded both parts, combined like terms, identified the coefficient of xy, set it equal to zero, and solved for a. Everything seems to check out.Just to be thorough, let me substitute a = 2 back into the original expression and see if the xy term indeed cancels out.Original expression: 2(x² - xy + y²) - (3x² - 2xy + y²).Expanding the first part: 2x² - 2xy + 2y².Expanding the second part with a = 2: -3x² + 2xy - y².Combine them: 2x² - 2xy + 2y² - 3x² + 2xy - y².Combine like terms:x² terms: 2x² - 3x² = -x².xy terms: -2xy + 2xy = 0xy.y² terms: 2y² - y² = y².So, the expression simplifies to -x² + y², which indeed has no xy term. That confirms that a = 2 is the correct answer.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. It makes sense because when a is 2, the coefficients of the xy terms from both expansions cancel each other out, leaving no xy term in the final expression.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"If the letter order of the English word \\"good\\" is written incorrectly, there are a total of ________ possible errors.","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of possible ways to arrange the letters in the word \\"good.\\" Since there are four letters with the letter \\"o\\" repeating twice, the total number of unique arrangements is calculated using the formula for permutations of multiset: 4! divided by 2!, which equals 12.Next, I recognize that only one of these arrangements is the correct spelling of the word \\"good.\\" Therefore, the number of incorrect arrangements is the total arrangements minus the correct one, resulting in 11 possible errors."},{"question":"Two numbers ( x ) and ( y ) have a product which is equal to their sum.

Let me read it again: Given vectors a and b have an angle of 60 degrees between them, the magnitude of vector a is 1, and the magnitude of 2a minus b is the square root of 7. I need to find the magnitude of vector b, which is denoted as |b|.Alright, let's break this down. I remember that when dealing with vectors and their magnitudes, the dot product formula is really useful. The formula for the magnitude of a vector difference or sum involves the dot product of the vectors involved. So, maybe I can use that here.First, let me recall the formula for the magnitude of a vector. The magnitude of a vector c is given by |c| = sqrt(c · c). So, if I have 2a - b, its magnitude squared would be (2a - b) · (2a - b). That should equal (sqrt(7)) squared, which is 7.Let me write that down:|2a - b|² = (2a - b) · (2a - b) = 7.Expanding the dot product, I get:(2a) · (2a) - 2a · b - b · 2a + b · b.Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify it step by step. Let's compute it term by term.First, (2a) · (2a) is 4(a · a). Since |a| is 1, a · a is |a|², which is 1² = 1. So, 4(a · a) is 4*1 = 4.Next, the cross terms: -2a · b and -b · 2a. Since the dot product is commutative, a · b = b · a, so these two terms are the same. So, -2a · b - 2a · b is -4a · b.Lastly, b · b is |b|², which is what we're trying to find. Let's denote |b| as x for simplicity. So, b · b is x².Putting it all together, the equation becomes:4 - 4a · b + x² = 7.Hmm, okay. So, 4 - 4a · b + x² = 7. Let me rearrange this:x² - 4a · b + 4 - 7 = 0.Simplify that:x² - 4a · b - 3 = 0.So, x² - 4a · b = 3.Now, I need to find a · b. I remember that the dot product of two vectors is given by |a||b|cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them. In this case, the angle is 60 degrees, |a| is 1, and |b| is x.So, a · b = |a||b|cos(60°). Plugging in the values:a · b = 1 * x * cos(60°).I know that cos(60°) is 0.5, so:a · b = x * 0.5 = 0.5x.Alright, so a · b is 0.5x. Let's substitute that back into our previous equation:x² - 4*(0.5x) = 3.Simplify the equation:x² - 2x = 3.Bring all terms to one side:x² - 2x - 3 = 0.Now, I have a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let's solve for x.The quadratic equation is x² - 2x - 3 = 0. To solve this, I can use the quadratic formula:x = [2 ± sqrt( ( -2 )² - 4*1*(-3) ) ] / (2*1).Calculating the discriminant:sqrt(4 + 12) = sqrt(16) = 4.So, the solutions are:x = [2 + 4]/2 = 6/2 = 3,andx = [2 - 4]/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.But since x is the magnitude of vector b, it can't be negative. So, x = 3.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I started with |2a - b|² = 7.2. Expanded it to 4(a · a) - 4(a · b) + (b · b) = 7.3. Since |a| = 1, a · a = 1, so 4*1 = 4.4. Then, a · b = |a||b|cos(theta) = 1*x*cos(60°) = 0.5x.5. Plugged that into the equation: 4 - 4*(0.5x) + x² = 7.6. Simplified to x² - 2x + 4 - 7 = 0, which is x² - 2x - 3 = 0.7. Solved the quadratic equation, got x = 3 and x = -1, discarded the negative solution.So, yeah, that seems correct. Therefore, the magnitude of vector b is 3.Wait, just to double-check, let me plug x = 3 back into the original expression to see if it satisfies |2a - b| = sqrt(7).Compute |2a - b|²:= (2a - b) · (2a - b)= 4(a · a) - 4(a · b) + (b · b)= 4*1 - 4*(0.5*3) + 9= 4 - 4*(1.5) + 9= 4 - 6 + 9= (4 - 6) + 9= (-2) + 9= 7.Which is exactly what was given. So, that checks out. So, x = 3 is correct.I think that's solid. So, the magnitude of vector b is 3.**Final Answer**The magnitude of vector (overrightarrow{b}) is (boxed{3})."},{"question":"There are 160 balls in total of three colors: red, yellow, and white.

If frac{1}{5} of the red balls, frac{1}{4} of the yellow balls, and frac{1}{3} of the white balls are taken out, then 116 balls remain. How many red, yellow, and white balls were there originally?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are 160 balls in total, and they're colored red, yellow, and white. The problem gives me two different scenarios where some balls are taken out, and then a certain number remain. I need to figure out how many red, yellow, and white balls there were originally.Let me break this down. First, let's define variables for the number of each color of balls. Let me say:- Let R be the number of red balls.- Let Y be the number of yellow balls.- Let W be the number of white balls.So, according to the problem, the total number of balls is 160. That gives me my first equation:R + Y + W = 160.Okay, that's straightforward. Now, the problem gives me two different scenarios where some balls are taken out, and then 120 and 116 balls remain respectively. I need to translate these scenarios into equations.First scenario: 1/3 of the red balls, 1/4 of the yellow balls, and 1/5 of the white balls are taken out, leaving 120 balls. So, the number of balls remaining would be the total minus the ones taken out. So, the remaining balls are:(1 - 1/3)R + (1 - 1/4)Y + (1 - 1/5)W = 120.Simplifying that, 1 - 1/3 is 2/3, 1 - 1/4 is 3/4, and 1 - 1/5 is 4/5. So, the equation becomes:(2/3)R + (3/4)Y + (4/5)W = 120.Okay, that's my second equation.Second scenario: 1/5 of the red balls, 1/4 of the yellow balls, and 1/3 of the white balls are taken out, leaving 116 balls. So, similar to the first scenario, the remaining balls are:(1 - 1/5)R + (1 - 1/4)Y + (1 - 1/3)W = 116.Simplifying that, 1 - 1/5 is 4/5, 1 - 1/4 is 3/4, and 1 - 1/3 is 2/3. So, the equation becomes:(4/5)R + (3/4)Y + (2/3)W = 116.Alright, so now I have three equations:1. R + Y + W = 160.2. (2/3)R + (3/4)Y + (4/5)W = 120.3. (4/5)R + (3/4)Y + (2/3)W = 116.So, I have a system of three equations with three variables. I need to solve this system to find R, Y, and W.Hmm, solving systems with fractions can be a bit tricky, but maybe I can eliminate the fractions by multiplying each equation by a common denominator. Let me see.Looking at the second equation, denominators are 3, 4, and 5. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5 is 60. Similarly, the third equation has denominators 5, 4, and 3, so same LCM of 60. The first equation is already without fractions, so maybe I can multiply the second and third equations by 60 to eliminate the denominators.Let me try that.Starting with the second equation:(2/3)R + (3/4)Y + (4/5)W = 120.Multiply both sides by 60:60*(2/3)R + 60*(3/4)Y + 60*(4/5)W = 60*120.Calculating each term:60*(2/3) = 40, so 40R.60*(3/4) = 45, so 45Y.60*(4/5) = 48, so 48W.60*120 = 7200.So, the second equation becomes:40R + 45Y + 48W = 7200.Similarly, for the third equation:(4/5)R + (3/4)Y + (2/3)W = 116.Multiply both sides by 60:60*(4/5)R + 60*(3/4)Y + 60*(2/3)W = 60*116.Calculating each term:60*(4/5) = 48, so 48R.60*(3/4) = 45, so 45Y.60*(2/3) = 40, so 40W.60*116 = 6960.So, the third equation becomes:48R + 45Y + 40W = 6960.Okay, now I have the system:1. R + Y + W = 160.2. 40R + 45Y + 48W = 7200.3. 48R + 45Y + 40W = 6960.Hmm, now I have three equations without fractions. Maybe I can subtract equation 2 and equation 3 to eliminate Y, since both have 45Y.Let me write equations 2 and 3:Equation 2: 40R + 45Y + 48W = 7200.Equation 3: 48R + 45Y + 40W = 6960.Subtract equation 3 from equation 2:(40R - 48R) + (45Y - 45Y) + (48W - 40W) = 7200 - 6960.Calculating each term:40R - 48R = -8R.45Y - 45Y = 0.48W - 40W = 8W.7200 - 6960 = 240.So, the result is:-8R + 8W = 240.Simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 8:-R + W = 30.So, W = R + 30.Okay, that's a useful equation. So, the number of white balls is 30 more than the number of red balls.Now, let's see if we can use this in the other equations.We have equation 1: R + Y + W = 160.Since W = R + 30, substitute that into equation 1:R + Y + (R + 30) = 160.Simplify:2R + Y + 30 = 160.Subtract 30 from both sides:2R + Y = 130.So, Y = 130 - 2R.Alright, so now we have expressions for W and Y in terms of R.So, W = R + 30.Y = 130 - 2R.Now, let's substitute these into one of the other equations, say equation 2 or 3. Let's pick equation 2:40R + 45Y + 48W = 7200.Substitute Y and W:40R + 45*(130 - 2R) + 48*(R + 30) = 7200.Let me compute each term step by step.First, compute 45*(130 - 2R):45*130 = 5850.45*(-2R) = -90R.So, that term is 5850 - 90R.Next, compute 48*(R + 30):48*R = 48R.48*30 = 1440.So, that term is 48R + 1440.Now, plug these back into the equation:40R + (5850 - 90R) + (48R + 1440) = 7200.Now, combine like terms.First, let's combine the R terms:40R - 90R + 48R = (40 - 90 + 48)R = (-50 + 48)R = (-2)R.Then, the constants:5850 + 1440 = 7290.So, the equation becomes:-2R + 7290 = 7200.Now, solve for R:-2R = 7200 - 7290.7200 - 7290 = -90.So, -2R = -90.Divide both sides by -2:R = (-90)/(-2) = 45.So, R is 45.Now, since W = R + 30, W = 45 + 30 = 75.And Y = 130 - 2R = 130 - 2*45 = 130 - 90 = 40.So, R = 45, Y = 40, W = 75.Let me check if these numbers satisfy all the original equations.First, total balls: 45 + 40 + 75 = 160. That's correct.First scenario: 1/3 of red, 1/4 of yellow, 1/5 of white taken out.So, taken out: (1/3)*45 = 15 red, (1/4)*40 = 10 yellow, (1/5)*75 = 15 white.Total taken out: 15 + 10 + 15 = 40.Total remaining: 160 - 40 = 120. That's correct.Second scenario: 1/5 of red, 1/4 of yellow, 1/3 of white taken out.Taken out: (1/5)*45 = 9 red, (1/4)*40 = 10 yellow, (1/3)*75 = 25 white.Total taken out: 9 + 10 + 25 = 44.Total remaining: 160 - 44 = 116. That's correct.So, all the numbers check out.Therefore, the original number of red, yellow, and white balls are 45, 40, and 75 respectively.**Final Answer**The original number of red, yellow, and white balls are boxed{45}, boxed{40}, and boxed{75} respectively."},{"question":"Anya washes 32 hairs down the drain when she washes her hair and brushes out half that amount when she brushes it. How many hairs does Anya have to grow back to always have one more hair than she started with after washing, brushing, and growing it?","answer":"First, determine the total number of hairs Anya loses during washing and brushing. She washes 32 hairs down the drain and brushes out half of that amount, which is 16 hairs. So, she loses a total of 48 hairs.Next, let ( x ) represent the number of hairs Anya needs to grow back. After washing, brushing, and growing, the total number of hairs she has is ( 32 + x ).To ensure she always has one more hair than she started with, the equation becomes:[32 + x = 32 + 48 + 1]Simplifying this, we get:[x = 17]Therefore, Anya needs to grow back 17 hairs."},{"question":"Which of these triples could <u>not</u> be the lengths of the three altitudes of a triangle?  textbf{(A)} 1,sqrt{3},2 qquadtextbf{(B)} 3,4,5 qquadtextbf{(C)} 5,12,13 qquadtextbf{(D)} 7,8,sqrt{113} qquadtextbf{(E)} 8,15,17  ","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which of the given triples cannot be the lengths of the three altitudes of a triangle. The options are:A) 1, √3, 2  B) 3, 4, 5  C) 5, 12, 13  D) 7, 8, √113  E) 8, 15, 17Hmm, I remember that in a triangle, the lengths of the altitudes are related to the sides of the triangle. Specifically, the altitude corresponding to a side is equal to twice the area divided by the length of that side. So, if we have a triangle with sides a, b, c, the corresponding altitudes h_a, h_b, h_c would be:h_a = 2Δ / a  h_b = 2Δ / b  h_c = 2Δ / cWhere Δ is the area of the triangle.So, if we have the three altitudes, we can find the sides by rearranging the above equations:a = 2Δ / h_a  b = 2Δ / h_b  c = 2Δ / h_cBut since Δ is the same for all three, the sides are proportional to 1/h_a, 1/h_b, 1/h_c. So, if we take the reciprocals of the altitudes, they should correspond to the sides of a triangle. Therefore, to check if a given triple can be the altitudes of a triangle, we can take their reciprocals and see if those reciprocals can form a valid triangle.Wait, so that means if I take the reciprocals of the given triples and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality, then the original triples can be altitudes. If the reciprocals don't form a valid triangle, then the original triple cannot be the altitudes.So, let's test each option one by one.Starting with option A: 1, √3, 2.First, take reciprocals: 1, 1/√3, 1/2.Let me write them as decimals for easier comparison:1, approximately 0.577, 0.5.So, the reciprocals are approximately 1, 0.577, 0.5.Now, check the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.Check 0.5 + 0.577 > 1? 0.5 + 0.577 = 1.077, which is greater than 1. Okay.Check 0.5 + 1 > 0.577? 1.5 > 0.577. Yes.Check 0.577 + 1 > 0.5? 1.577 > 0.5. Yes.So, all triangle inequalities are satisfied. Therefore, the reciprocals can form a triangle, so the original triple can be the altitudes. So, A is possible.Moving on to option B: 3, 4, 5.Take reciprocals: 1/3, 1/4, 1/5.Convert to decimals: approximately 0.333, 0.25, 0.2.Check triangle inequalities:0.25 + 0.2 > 0.333? 0.45 > 0.333. Yes.0.333 + 0.2 > 0.25? 0.533 > 0.25. Yes.0.333 + 0.25 > 0.2? 0.583 > 0.2. Yes.All inequalities hold, so reciprocals can form a triangle. Therefore, B is possible.Option C: 5, 12, 13.Reciprocals: 1/5, 1/12, 1/13.Decimals: 0.2, approximately 0.0833, approximately 0.0769.Check triangle inequalities:0.0833 + 0.0769 > 0.2? 0.1602 > 0.2? No, that's 0.1602 < 0.2. So, this inequality fails.Therefore, the reciprocals cannot form a triangle. So, the original triple cannot be the altitudes of a triangle. Hmm, so is C the answer? Wait, let me check the other options just to be sure.Option D: 7, 8, √113.First, compute √113. Let me approximate that: 10^2 = 100, 11^2=121, so √113 is approximately 10.63.So, reciprocals: 1/7 ≈ 0.1429, 1/8 = 0.125, 1/10.63 ≈ 0.094.So, the reciprocals are approximately 0.1429, 0.125, 0.094.Check triangle inequalities:0.125 + 0.094 > 0.1429? 0.219 > 0.1429. Yes.0.1429 + 0.094 > 0.125? 0.2369 > 0.125. Yes.0.1429 + 0.125 > 0.094? 0.2679 > 0.094. Yes.All inequalities hold, so reciprocals can form a triangle. Therefore, D is possible.Option E: 8, 15, 17.Reciprocals: 1/8 = 0.125, 1/15 ≈ 0.0667, 1/17 ≈ 0.0588.Check triangle inequalities:0.0667 + 0.0588 > 0.125? 0.1255 > 0.125? Hmm, that's approximately equal, but technically, 0.1255 is just barely greater than 0.125. So, does that count?Wait, in triangle inequality, the sum must be greater than the third side. So, 0.0667 + 0.0588 = 0.1255, which is just barely greater than 0.125. So, in reality, 1/15 + 1/17 = (17 + 15)/(15*17) = 32/255 ≈ 0.1255, which is just over 1/8 = 0.125.So, it's barely satisfying the triangle inequality. So, technically, the reciprocals can form a triangle, albeit a very \\"flat\\" one where two sides are almost colinear. So, E is possible.Therefore, going back to option C: 5, 12, 13. The reciprocals 1/5, 1/12, 1/13 don't satisfy the triangle inequality because 1/12 + 1/13 ≈ 0.0833 + 0.0769 ≈ 0.1602, which is less than 1/5 = 0.2. So, the sum of the two smaller reciprocals is less than the largest reciprocal, which violates the triangle inequality. Therefore, the reciprocals cannot form a triangle, so the original triple cannot be the altitudes of a triangle.Hence, the answer is C.Wait, but just to make sure, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept of the area?Let me think. If we have three altitudes, h_a, h_b, h_c, then the sides are proportional to 1/h_a, 1/h_b, 1/h_c. So, if we let the sides be k/h_a, k/h_b, k/h_c for some constant k, then the area would be (base * height)/2, so for each side, the area would be (k/h_a * h_a)/2 = k/2, same for others. So, the area is consistent.But for the sides to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality, which is exactly what we checked with the reciprocals.So, yes, that method is correct.Alternatively, another approach is to note that in a triangle, the reciprocals of the altitudes must satisfy the triangle inequality. So, if 1/h_a + 1/h_b > 1/h_c, and so on for all combinations.Therefore, for each triple, compute 1/h1 + 1/h2 > 1/h3, 1/h1 + 1/h3 > 1/h2, and 1/h2 + 1/h3 > 1/h1.So, for option C: 5,12,13.Compute 1/5 + 1/12 = 12/60 + 5/60 = 17/60 ≈ 0.2833.Compare to 1/13 ≈ 0.0769. 0.2833 > 0.0769, which is true.Wait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Wait, no, wait, actually, no.Wait, no, the triangle inequality is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, in terms of reciprocals, 1/h_a + 1/h_b > 1/h_c, etc.Wait, so for C: 5,12,13.1/5 + 1/12 = 17/60 ≈ 0.2833.Compare to 1/13 ≈ 0.0769. So, 0.2833 > 0.0769, which is true.Similarly, 1/5 + 1/13 = 18/65 ≈ 0.2769 > 1/12 ≈ 0.0833. True.And 1/12 + 1/13 ≈ 0.0833 + 0.0769 ≈ 0.1602 > 1/5 = 0.2? No, 0.1602 < 0.2. So, that inequality fails.Therefore, 1/12 + 1/13 is not greater than 1/5, so the triangle inequality is violated. Therefore, reciprocals cannot form a triangle, so the original triple cannot be the altitudes.So, that's consistent with my earlier conclusion.Therefore, the answer is C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"A bug starts from the origin O and crawls back and forth along the number line.

It says that in the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, a_6 is 6 and a_9 is 9. I need to find a_3. Hmm, arithmetic sequences, right? They have a common difference between consecutive terms. Let me recall the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.I think it's a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference. Yeah, that sounds right. So, if I can find a_1 and d, I can figure out any term in the sequence, including a_3.Given that a_6 = 6, let me plug that into the formula. So, a_6 = a_1 + (6-1)d = a_1 + 5d = 6. Similarly, a_9 = a_1 + (9-1)d = a_1 + 8d = 9. So now I have two equations:1. a_1 + 5d = 62. a_1 + 8d = 9Hmm, I can solve these two equations simultaneously to find a_1 and d. Let me subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a_1. So, (a_1 + 8d) - (a_1 + 5d) = 9 - 6. Simplifying that, a_1 cancels out, and 8d - 5d = 3d = 3. So, 3d = 3, which means d = 1. Okay, so the common difference is 1.Now that I have d, I can plug it back into one of the equations to find a_1. Let's use the first equation: a_1 + 5d = 6. Since d is 1, that becomes a_1 + 5*1 = 6, so a_1 + 5 = 6. Subtracting 5 from both sides, a_1 = 1. Got it, so the first term is 1 and the common difference is 1.Now, the question asks for a_3. Let me use the formula again: a_3 = a_1 + (3-1)d = a_1 + 2d. Plugging in the values, that's 1 + 2*1 = 1 + 2 = 3. So, a_3 should be 3.Wait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning, arithmetic sequence with a_6 = 6 and a_9 = 9. Using the formula, I set up two equations:1. a_1 + 5d = 62. a_1 + 8d = 9Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 gives 3d = 3, so d = 1. Then, plugging back in, a_1 = 6 - 5d = 6 - 5 = 1. So, a_1 is indeed 1. Then, a_3 is a_1 + 2d = 1 + 2 = 3. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the terms in the sequence. Since it's an arithmetic sequence with d = 1, each term increases by 1. So starting from a_1 = 1, the sequence would be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ... So, a_1 is 1, a_2 is 2, a_3 is 3, a_4 is 4, a_5 is 5, a_6 is 6, a_7 is 7, a_8 is 8, a_9 is 9. Yep, that matches the given information: a_6 is 6 and a_9 is 9. So, a_3 is indeed 3.I think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that a_3 is 3.**Final Answer**The value of ( a_3 ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Given a^{2}+a-4=0, the value of the algebraic expression (a^{2}-3)(a+2) is:A: 2B: -4C: 4D: -2","answer":"Okay, so I have this algebra problem here. It says that given the equation ( a^2 + a - 4 = 0 ), I need to find the value of the expression ( (a^2 - 3)(a + 2) ). The options are A: 2, B: -4, C: 4, D: -2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that ( a^2 + a - 4 = 0 ) is a quadratic equation. Maybe I can solve for ( a ) using the quadratic formula, but that might be complicated because it might involve square roots, and then I would have to substitute back into the expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the given equation to express ( a^2 ) in terms of ( a ), which might make substituting into the expression easier.Let me try that. If I have ( a^2 + a - 4 = 0 ), I can rearrange it to solve for ( a^2 ). So, subtract ( a ) and add 4 to both sides:( a^2 = -a + 4 ).Okay, so ( a^2 ) is equal to ( -a + 4 ). Maybe I can substitute this into the expression ( (a^2 - 3)(a + 2) ). Let's see:First, substitute ( a^2 ) with ( -a + 4 ):( ( (-a + 4) - 3 )(a + 2) ).Simplify inside the first parenthesis:( (-a + 4 - 3) = (-a + 1) ).So now the expression becomes:( (-a + 1)(a + 2) ).Alright, now I need to multiply these two binomials. Let me use the distributive property (FOIL method):First, multiply ( -a ) by ( a ): ( -a times a = -a^2 ).Then, ( -a ) times 2: ( -a times 2 = -2a ).Next, 1 times ( a ): ( 1 times a = a ).And 1 times 2: ( 1 times 2 = 2 ).So putting it all together:( -a^2 - 2a + a + 2 ).Combine like terms:The ( -2a ) and ( a ) combine to ( -a ).So now we have:( -a^2 - a + 2 ).Hmm, okay. Now, I have ( -a^2 - a + 2 ). I wonder if I can use the original equation again to simplify this further. Remember, from the original equation ( a^2 + a - 4 = 0 ), we can express ( a^2 ) as ( -a + 4 ). So maybe I can substitute ( a^2 ) in this expression.Looking at ( -a^2 ), that would be ( -(-a + 4) ), right? Let's compute that:( -a^2 = -(-a + 4) = a - 4 ).So substituting back into the expression:( (a - 4) - a + 2 ).Simplify term by term:First, ( a - 4 ) is straightforward.Then subtract ( a ): ( a - 4 - a ).And then add 2: ( a - 4 - a + 2 ).Combine like terms:The ( a ) and ( -a ) cancel each other out, leaving ( -4 + 2 ).Which is ( -2 ).So, the value of the expression ( (a^2 - 3)(a + 2) ) is ( -2 ).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the substitution:We had ( a^2 = -a + 4 ), substituted into ( (a^2 - 3)(a + 2) ) to get ( (-a + 1)(a + 2) ). Then expanded that to ( -a^2 - a + 2 ). Then substituted ( a^2 ) again to get ( a - 4 - a + 2 ), which simplifies to ( -2 ). That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can solve for ( a ) using the quadratic formula and then plug into the expression. Let me try that as a verification.The quadratic equation is ( a^2 + a - 4 = 0 ). Using the quadratic formula:( a = frac{ -b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2a} ).Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 1 ), ( c = -4 ).So,( a = frac{ -1 pm sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-4)} }{2(1)} )Simplify inside the square root:( 1 - (-16) = 1 + 16 = 17 ).So,( a = frac{ -1 pm sqrt{17} }{2} ).So, the solutions are ( a = frac{ -1 + sqrt{17} }{2} ) and ( a = frac{ -1 - sqrt{17} }{2} ).Now, let's compute ( (a^2 - 3)(a + 2) ) for both roots.First, take ( a = frac{ -1 + sqrt{17} }{2} ).Compute ( a + 2 ):( frac{ -1 + sqrt{17} }{2} + 2 = frac{ -1 + sqrt{17} + 4 }{2} = frac{ 3 + sqrt{17} }{2} ).Compute ( a^2 ):We know from the original equation that ( a^2 = -a + 4 ). So,( a^2 = - left( frac{ -1 + sqrt{17} }{2} right ) + 4 = frac{1 - sqrt{17} }{2} + 4 = frac{1 - sqrt{17} + 8 }{2} = frac{9 - sqrt{17} }{2} ).So, ( a^2 - 3 = frac{9 - sqrt{17} }{2} - 3 = frac{9 - sqrt{17} - 6 }{2} = frac{3 - sqrt{17} }{2} ).Now, multiply ( (a^2 - 3)(a + 2) ):( left( frac{3 - sqrt{17} }{2} right ) times left( frac{3 + sqrt{17} }{2} right ) ).This is a difference of squares: ( (3)^2 - (sqrt{17})^2 = 9 - 17 = -8 ).But wait, we have denominators of 2 each, so the product is ( frac{ -8 }{4} = -2 ).Okay, so that gives us ( -2 ). Let me check with the other root just to be thorough.Take ( a = frac{ -1 - sqrt{17} }{2} ).Compute ( a + 2 ):( frac{ -1 - sqrt{17} }{2} + 2 = frac{ -1 - sqrt{17} + 4 }{2} = frac{ 3 - sqrt{17} }{2} ).Compute ( a^2 ):Again, using ( a^2 = -a + 4 ).( a^2 = - left( frac{ -1 - sqrt{17} }{2} right ) + 4 = frac{1 + sqrt{17} }{2} + 4 = frac{1 + sqrt{17} + 8 }{2} = frac{9 + sqrt{17} }{2} ).So, ( a^2 - 3 = frac{9 + sqrt{17} }{2} - 3 = frac{9 + sqrt{17} - 6 }{2} = frac{3 + sqrt{17} }{2} ).Multiply ( (a^2 - 3)(a + 2) ):( left( frac{3 + sqrt{17} }{2} right ) times left( frac{3 - sqrt{17} }{2} right ) ).Again, difference of squares: ( 9 - 17 = -8 ).Divide by 4: ( -8 / 4 = -2 ).So, both roots give the same result, ( -2 ). That confirms my earlier result.Therefore, the value of the expression is ( -2 ), which is option D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Calculate the lengths of the arcs of the curves given by the parametric equations:begin{aligned}& left{begin{array}{l}x=6(cos t+t sin t) y=6(sin t-t cos t)end{array}right. & 0 leq t leq piend{aligned}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the length of the arc of a curve given by parametric equations. The equations are:begin{aligned}x &= 6(cos t + t sin t) y &= 6(sin t - t cos t)end{aligned}and the parameter ( t ) ranges from 0 to ( pi ). Hmm, I remember that the formula for the arc length of a parametric curve is an integral involving the derivatives of ( x ) and ( y ) with respect to ( t ). Let me try to recall the exact formula.I think it's something like:L = int_{a}^{b} sqrt{left(frac{dx}{dt}right)^2 + left(frac{dy}{dt}right)^2} , dtYes, that sounds right. So, I need to find the derivatives ( frac{dx}{dt} ) and ( frac{dy}{dt} ), square them, add them together, take the square root, and then integrate from 0 to ( pi ).Alright, let's start by finding ( frac{dx}{dt} ) and ( frac{dy}{dt} ).First, for ( x = 6(cos t + t sin t) ):Let me differentiate term by term. The derivative of ( cos t ) is ( -sin t ). Then, for the term ( t sin t ), I need to use the product rule. The derivative of ( t ) is 1, multiplied by ( sin t ), plus ( t ) multiplied by the derivative of ( sin t ), which is ( cos t ). So, putting it all together:frac{dx}{dt} = 6 left( -sin t + sin t + t cos t right )Wait, let me double-check that. The derivative of ( cos t ) is ( -sin t ), and the derivative of ( t sin t ) is ( sin t + t cos t ). So, combining these:frac{dx}{dt} = 6 [ -sin t + sin t + t cos t ] = 6 [ 0 + t cos t ] = 6 t cos tOh, nice! The ( -sin t ) and ( +sin t ) cancel each other out, leaving just ( 6 t cos t ). That's simpler than I expected.Now, moving on to ( y = 6(sin t - t cos t) ):Again, I'll differentiate term by term. The derivative of ( sin t ) is ( cos t ). For the term ( -t cos t ), I'll need the product rule again. The derivative of ( -t ) is ( -1 ), multiplied by ( cos t ), plus ( -t ) multiplied by the derivative of ( cos t ), which is ( -sin t ). So:frac{dy}{dt} = 6 left( cos t - cos t + t sin t right )Wait, let's go through that step by step. The derivative of ( sin t ) is ( cos t ). Then, the derivative of ( -t cos t ) is ( -cos t + t sin t ) because:- The derivative of ( -t ) is ( -1 ), times ( cos t ) is ( -cos t ).- Plus ( -t ) times the derivative of ( cos t ), which is ( -sin t ), so that's ( -t (-sin t) = t sin t ).So, combining these:frac{dy}{dt} = 6 [ cos t - cos t + t sin t ] = 6 [ 0 + t sin t ] = 6 t sin tAgain, the ( cos t ) terms cancel out, leaving ( 6 t sin t ). That's a relief; it's symmetric to the ( dx/dt ) result.So now, I have:frac{dx}{dt} = 6 t cos t frac{dy}{dt} = 6 t sin tGreat, now I need to compute ( left(frac{dx}{dt}right)^2 + left(frac{dy}{dt}right)^2 ).Let me compute each square separately:First, ( left(6 t cos tright)^2 = 36 t^2 cos^2 t ).Second, ( left(6 t sin tright)^2 = 36 t^2 sin^2 t ).Adding these together:36 t^2 cos^2 t + 36 t^2 sin^2 t = 36 t^2 (cos^2 t + sin^2 t)Ah, I remember that ( cos^2 t + sin^2 t = 1 ), so this simplifies to:36 t^2 times 1 = 36 t^2Therefore, the integrand becomes:sqrt{36 t^2} = 6 |t|But since ( t ) is in the interval from 0 to ( pi ), ( t ) is non-negative, so ( |t| = t ). Thus, the integrand simplifies to ( 6 t ).So, the arc length ( L ) is:L = int_{0}^{pi} 6 t , dtThat's a straightforward integral. Let me compute that.The integral of ( t ) with respect to ( t ) is ( frac{1}{2} t^2 ). So, multiplying by 6:L = 6 times left[ frac{1}{2} t^2 right]_{0}^{pi} = 6 times left( frac{1}{2} pi^2 - frac{1}{2} times 0^2 right ) = 6 times left( frac{pi^2}{2} right ) = 3 pi^2Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my steps.1. Differentiated ( x ) and ( y ) correctly, got ( 6 t cos t ) and ( 6 t sin t ).2. Squared them, added, factored out 36 t^2, used Pythagorean identity to get 36 t^2.3. Square root gives 6 t, since t is positive in [0, π].4. Integrated 6 t from 0 to π: integral is 3 t^2 evaluated from 0 to π, which is 3 π^2.Yes, that seems correct. So, the arc length is ( 3 pi^2 ).But just to be thorough, let me think if I made any assumptions or skipped any steps that might have errors.First, when differentiating ( x ) and ( y ), I used the product rule correctly. The terms did cancel out as expected, so the derivatives are correct.Then, when squaring and adding, I correctly factored out 36 t^2 and applied the identity. The square root was correctly simplified to 6 t.The integral of 6 t is indeed 3 t^2, so evaluating from 0 to π gives 3 π^2.Therefore, I think my answer is correct.**Final Answer**The length of the arc is boxed{3pi^2}."},{"question":"On Monday, Knight Milivoj traveled 25 miles and spent the night in Zubín. The next day, Tuesday, he reached Veselín. On the way back, he traveled 6 miles more on Thursday than on Monday and spent the night in Kostín. On Friday, he traveled the remaining 11 miles to Rytířov. Determine the distance between Zubín and Veselín.","answer":"Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have Knight Milivoj traveling from Monday to Friday, and we need to find the distance between Zubín and Veselín. Hmm, okay, let's break down the information given.First, on Monday, he traveled 25 miles and spent the night in Zubín. So, that means the starting point to Zubín is 25 miles. Then, on Tuesday, he reached Veselín. So, from Zubín to Veselín, that's another leg of the journey. We don't know how long that is yet, so let's call that distance \\"D\\". So, D is the distance we need to find.Now, moving on. On the way back, which would be Thursday, he traveled 6 miles more than he did on Monday. Since he traveled 25 miles on Monday, on Thursday he must have traveled 25 + 6 = 31 miles. He spent the night in Kostín. So, that means from wherever he was on Thursday morning, he traveled 31 miles to Kostín.Then, on Friday, he traveled the remaining 11 miles to Rytířov. So, from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles.Wait, let me visualize this. So, starting from the initial point, he goes 25 miles to Zubín on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, he goes from Zubín to Veselín, which is D miles. Then, on Thursday, he starts going back, and travels 31 miles to Kostín. Then, on Friday, he goes the remaining 11 miles to Rytířov.Hmm, so the total distance from the starting point to Rytířov must be the sum of all these legs. But wait, actually, he went from starting point to Zubín (25 miles), then to Veselín (D miles), then back towards starting point, passing through Kostín (31 miles), and then finally 11 miles to Rytířov.Wait, so is Rytířov the starting point? Or is it another place? Hmm, the problem says he traveled the remaining 11 miles to Rytířov. So, Rytířov is the final destination, which is 11 miles from Kostín.But let's think about the entire journey. If he went from starting point to Zubín (25 miles), then to Veselín (D miles), then back towards starting point, passing through Kostín (31 miles), and then 11 miles to Rytířov.So, the total distance from starting point to Rytířov would be 25 + D - 31 - 11? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently.Alternatively, perhaps the distance from starting point to Rytířov is the same as the distance from starting point to Zubín plus Zubín to Veselín, which is 25 + D. Then, on the way back, he travels 31 miles from Veselín towards starting point, ending up in Kostín. Then, from Kostín, he goes 11 miles to Rytířov.So, if we consider that, the distance from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles, and Kostín is 31 miles away from Veselín towards the starting point. So, the distance from Veselín to Rytířov would be 31 + 11 = 42 miles.But wait, the distance from starting point to Rytířov is 25 + D, right? Because starting point to Zubín is 25, Zubín to Veselín is D, so starting point to Veselín is 25 + D. Then, from Veselín to Rytířov is 42 miles, so starting point to Rytířov is (25 + D) + 42? Wait, that can't be, because starting point to Rytířov is also equal to starting point to Kostín plus Kostín to Rytířov.Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me try to draw a diagram in my mind.Starting point: Let's call it S.Monday: S to Zubín (25 miles).Tuesday: Zubín to Veselín (D miles).Thursday: Veselín back towards S, 31 miles to Kostín.Friday: Kostín to Rytířov (11 miles).So, the total distance from S to Rytířov is S to Kostín plus Kostín to Rytířov.But S to Kostín is S to Veselín minus Kostín to Veselín. S to Veselín is 25 + D. Kostín is 31 miles from Veselín towards S, so S to Kostín is (25 + D) - 31.Then, Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles. So, S to Rytířov is [(25 + D) - 31] + 11 = 25 + D - 31 + 11 = 25 + D - 20 = D + 5.But also, S to Rytířov can be considered as the direct distance, but we don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the entire journey.Wait, maybe the total distance he traveled is the sum of all these legs: 25 (Monday) + D (Tuesday) + 31 (Thursday) + 11 (Friday). So, total distance is 25 + D + 31 + 11 = D + 67 miles.But is there another way to compute the total distance? Because he went from S to Veselín and then back partway to Rytířov. So, the total distance would also be 2*(25 + D) - (distance from Rytířov to S). Wait, no, that might not be accurate.Alternatively, the total distance is the sum of all his travels: 25 + D + 31 + 11. So, that's D + 67.But also, the total distance can be thought of as going from S to Veselín (25 + D) and then back towards S, stopping at Kostín (31 miles from Veselín) and then going 11 miles past Kostín to Rytířov. So, the total distance going back is 31 + 11 = 42 miles. So, total distance is (25 + D) + 42 = D + 67, which matches the previous total.So, that doesn't help us find D. Hmm.Wait, maybe we need to consider the distance from S to Rytířov. Since he went from S to Veselín (25 + D) and then back 42 miles to Rytířov, so the distance from S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 42. But also, from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles, and Kostín is 31 miles from Veselín, so the distance from S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 31 - 11 = 25 + D - 42 = D - 17.But we also know that from S to Rytířov is equal to the distance from S to Kostín plus Kostín to Rytířov. S to Kostín is (25 + D) - 31 = D - 6. So, S to Rytířov is (D - 6) + 11 = D + 5.Wait, so we have two expressions for S to Rytířov: D - 17 and D + 5. That can't be unless D - 17 = D + 5, which would imply -17 = 5, which is impossible. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.Let me go back. Maybe I misapplied the distances. Let's try again.Starting point S.Monday: S to Zubín: 25 miles.Tuesday: Zubín to Veselín: D miles. So, S to Veselín is 25 + D.Thursday: Veselín back towards S: 31 miles to Kostín. So, Kostín is 31 miles away from Veselín towards S. Therefore, S to Kostín is (25 + D) - 31 = D - 6.Friday: Kostín to Rytířov: 11 miles. So, S to Rytířov is S to Kostín + Kostín to Rytířov = (D - 6) + 11 = D + 5.But also, S to Rytířov can be considered as the remaining distance after going from S to Veselín and back 42 miles (31 + 11). So, S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 42 = D - 17.So, we have D + 5 = D - 17. That's impossible, so I must have messed up somewhere.Wait, perhaps the total distance from S to Rytířov is not (25 + D) - 42, but rather, since he went from Veselín back 31 miles to Kostín, and then 11 miles past Kostín to Rytířov, so the total distance from S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 31 + 11 = 25 + D - 31 + 11 = 25 + D - 20 = D + 5, which matches the previous calculation.But if S to Rytířov is D + 5, and also S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 42 = D - 17, then D + 5 = D - 17, which is impossible. So, there must be a misunderstanding in the problem.Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the direction. Perhaps on Thursday, he traveled 6 miles more than on Monday, but in the opposite direction. So, if he went 25 miles on Monday towards Zubín, then on Thursday, he went 25 + 6 = 31 miles back towards S, ending up in Kostín.So, from Veselín, he went back 31 miles to Kostín. So, the distance from Kostín to Veselín is 31 miles. Then, from Kostín, he went 11 miles further to Rytířov. So, the distance from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles, meaning that Rytířov is 11 miles beyond Kostín towards S.Therefore, the distance from Veselín to Rytířov is 31 + 11 = 42 miles.But the distance from S to Veselín is 25 + D. So, the distance from S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 42 = D - 17.But also, the distance from S to Rytířov can be considered as the distance from S to Kostín plus Kostín to Rytířov. S to Kostín is (25 + D) - 31 = D - 6. Then, Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles, so S to Rytířov is (D - 6) + 11 = D + 5.So, again, D - 17 = D + 5, which is impossible. Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, maybe the problem is that Rytířov is not on the same line as S to Veselín. Maybe it's a different route. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think we have to assume it's a straight line.Alternatively, perhaps the distance from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles, but in the opposite direction. Wait, no, the problem says he traveled the remaining 11 miles to Rytířov, implying that Rytířov is the final destination, so it must be in the direction towards S.Wait, maybe I need to set up equations.Let me denote:- Distance from S to Zubín: 25 miles.- Distance from Zubín to Veselín: D miles. So, S to Veselín: 25 + D.- On Thursday, he traveled 6 miles more than on Monday, so 25 + 6 = 31 miles back towards S, ending at Kostín. So, distance from Veselín to Kostín: 31 miles. Therefore, distance from S to Kostín: (25 + D) - 31 = D - 6.- On Friday, he traveled 11 miles from Kostín to Rytířov. So, distance from Kostín to Rytířov: 11 miles. Therefore, distance from S to Rytířov: (D - 6) + 11 = D + 5.But also, the distance from S to Rytířov can be considered as the distance from S to Veselín minus the distance from Veselín to Rytířov. Since he went back 31 miles from Veselín to Kostín, and then 11 miles further to Rytířov, the distance from Veselín to Rytířov is 31 + 11 = 42 miles. Therefore, distance from S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 42 = D - 17.So, we have two expressions for S to Rytířov: D + 5 and D - 17. Therefore:D + 5 = D - 17Subtract D from both sides:5 = -17Wait, that's impossible. So, this suggests that there's a contradiction, which means I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.Wait, maybe the distance from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles, but in the opposite direction. So, instead of going towards S, he went away from S. But that doesn't make sense because he was on his way back towards S.Alternatively, perhaps the total distance from S to Rytířov is 25 + D - 31 + 11. Wait, that would be 25 + D - 31 + 11 = 25 + D - 20 = D + 5, which is the same as before.But also, S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 42 = D - 17. So, same issue.Wait, maybe I need to consider that the distance from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles, but Kostín is 31 miles from Veselín towards S, so Rytířov is 11 miles beyond Kostín towards S. Therefore, the distance from S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 31 - 11 = 25 + D - 42 = D - 17.But also, the distance from S to Rytířov is equal to the distance from S to Kostín plus Kostín to Rytířov, which is (25 + D - 31) + 11 = D - 6 + 11 = D + 5.So, D - 17 = D + 5, which is impossible. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if my initial assumption about the direction is wrong.Wait, perhaps on Thursday, he didn't go back towards S, but continued forward beyond Veselín. But the problem says \\"on the way back\\", so he must be returning towards S.Wait, maybe the distance from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles in the opposite direction, meaning Rytířov is 11 miles away from Kostín towards Veselín. But that would mean he didn't reach Rytířov yet, but the problem says he reached Rytířov on Friday.Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to approach it differently.Let me denote the total distance from S to Veselín as T. So, T = 25 + D.On Thursday, he traveled 31 miles back towards S, ending at Kostín. So, the distance from Kostín to Veselín is 31 miles, meaning the distance from S to Kostín is T - 31 = (25 + D) - 31 = D - 6.On Friday, he traveled 11 miles from Kostín to Rytířov. So, the distance from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles. Therefore, the distance from S to Rytířov is (D - 6) + 11 = D + 5.But also, the distance from S to Rytířov can be considered as the distance from S to Veselín minus the distance from Veselín to Rytířov. Since he went back 31 miles from Veselín to Kostín, and then 11 miles further to Rytířov, the distance from Veselín to Rytířov is 31 + 11 = 42 miles. Therefore, the distance from S to Rytířov is T - 42 = (25 + D) - 42 = D - 17.So, we have two expressions for S to Rytířov: D + 5 and D - 17. Therefore:D + 5 = D - 17Which simplifies to 5 = -17, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or my interpretation.Wait, perhaps the distance on Thursday is 6 miles more than on Monday, but in the same direction. So, instead of going back, he went further. But the problem says \\"on the way back\\", so he must be returning.Alternatively, maybe the distance on Thursday is 6 miles more than on Monday, but not necessarily in the opposite direction. Wait, but \\"on the way back\\" implies he's returning.Wait, maybe the distance from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles, but in the same direction as he was going on Tuesday. So, instead of going back towards S, he went further towards Veselín. But that contradicts the \\"way back\\" part.Alternatively, perhaps the distance from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles, but Rytířov is a different location not on the same line. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think we have to assume it's a straight line.Wait, maybe I need to consider that the total distance from S to Rytířov is the same as the distance from S to Kostín plus Kostín to Rytířov, which is (D - 6) + 11 = D + 5. But also, the distance from S to Rytířov is equal to the distance from S to Veselín minus the distance from Veselín to Rytířov, which is (25 + D) - (31 + 11) = 25 + D - 42 = D - 17.So, D + 5 = D - 17, which is impossible. Therefore, the only conclusion is that the problem has inconsistent data, or I'm misinterpreting it.Wait, maybe the distance on Thursday is 6 miles more than on Monday, but on the way back, so he traveled 25 + 6 = 31 miles on Thursday, but that's from Veselín back towards S, ending at Kostín. Then, from Kostín, he traveled 11 miles to Rytířov. So, the total distance from S to Rytířov is S to Kostín + Kostín to Rytířov = (25 + D - 31) + 11 = D - 6 + 11 = D + 5.But also, the distance from S to Rytířov is equal to the distance from S to Veselín minus the distance from Veselín to Rytířov. Since he went back 31 miles from Veselín to Kostín, and then 11 miles further to Rytířov, the distance from Veselín to Rytířov is 31 + 11 = 42 miles. Therefore, S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 42 = D - 17.So, again, D + 5 = D - 17, which is impossible.Wait, maybe the distance from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles in the opposite direction, meaning Rytířov is 11 miles away from Kostín towards Veselín. So, the distance from S to Rytířov would be (25 + D) - 31 + 11 = 25 + D - 31 + 11 = 25 + D - 20 = D + 5.But also, the distance from S to Rytířov is equal to the distance from S to Kostín plus Kostín to Rytířov in the opposite direction, which would be (D - 6) + 11 = D + 5. Wait, that's the same as before.But if Rytířov is 11 miles towards Veselín from Kostín, then the distance from Veselín to Rytířov is 31 - 11 = 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 20 = D + 5.So, in this case, we have two expressions for S to Rytířov: D + 5 and D + 5. So, that works.Wait, so maybe I was wrong earlier about the distance from Veselín to Rytířov. If Rytířov is 11 miles towards Veselín from Kostín, then the distance from Veselín to Rytířov is 31 - 11 = 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from S to Rytířov is (25 + D) - 20 = D + 5.But also, from Kostín to Rytířov is 11 miles towards Veselín, so S to Rytířov is (D - 6) + 11 = D + 5.So, both expressions are the same, which is consistent. Therefore, there's no contradiction.So, in this case, we don't have a contradiction, but we still need to find D.Wait, but how? We have that S to Rytířov is D + 5, but we don't know S to Rytířov. Unless there's another way to express it.Wait, perhaps the total distance traveled is 25 (Monday) + D (Tuesday) + 31 (Thursday) + 11 (Friday) = D + 67 miles.But also, the total distance can be considered as going from S to Veselín (25 + D) and then back to Rytířov, which is D + 5 miles from S. So, the total distance would be (25 + D) + (D + 5) = 2D + 30 miles.But we also have total distance as D + 67. Therefore:2D + 30 = D + 67Subtract D from both sides:D + 30 = 67Subtract 30:D = 37So, the distance between Zubín and Veselín is 37 miles.Wait, let me verify this.If D = 37 miles, then:- Monday: 25 miles to Zubín.- Tuesday: 37 miles to Veselín. So, total from S to Veselín is 25 + 37 = 62 miles.- Thursday: 31 miles back towards S, ending at Kostín. So, Kostín is 62 - 31 = 31 miles from S.- Friday: 11 miles from Kostín to Rytířov. So, Rytířov is 31 + 11 = 42 miles from S.But also, from S to Rytířov is D + 5 = 37 + 5 = 42 miles. So, that matches.Therefore, the distance between Zubín and Veselín is 37 miles."},{"question":"What is the area of a regular octagon each of whose sides is a?","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the area of a regular octagon where each side is length 'a'. Hmm, I remember that a regular octagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. But I'm not exactly sure how to calculate its area. Let me think about different methods I can use.First, I recall that for regular polygons, there's a general formula for the area. It's something like (1/2) * perimeter * apothem. Yeah, that sounds right. So, if I can find the apothem, I can use that formula. The perimeter is easy because it's just 8 times the side length, so that would be 8a.But wait, what exactly is the apothem? If I remember correctly, the apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. It's like the radius of the inscribed circle. So, to find the area, I need to calculate this apothem.How do I find the apothem? I think it involves some trigonometry. Since a regular octagon can be divided into 8 congruent isosceles triangles, each with a vertex angle at the center of the octagon. The central angle for each triangle would be 360 degrees divided by 8, which is 45 degrees.So, each of these triangles has a vertex angle of 45 degrees and two sides that are radii of the circumscribed circle around the octagon. The base of each triangle is the side length 'a'. If I can find the apothem, which is the height of each of these triangles, I can then use it in the area formula.Let me visualize one of these triangles. It's an isosceles triangle with two sides equal to the radius 'R' of the circumscribed circle, and the base is 'a'. The apothem is the height of this triangle, which splits it into two right-angled triangles. Each of these right triangles has an angle of 22.5 degrees (half of 45 degrees), a hypotenuse of 'R', and the base of 'a/2'.So, in this right triangle, the apothem is the adjacent side to the 22.5-degree angle, and the opposite side is 'a/2'. Using trigonometry, specifically the tangent function, I can relate these sides.The tangent of 22.5 degrees is equal to the opposite side over the adjacent side, which is (a/2) divided by the apothem. So, tan(22.5°) = (a/2) / apothem. Therefore, the apothem is (a/2) divided by tan(22.5°).So, apothem = (a/2) / tan(22.5°). Now, I need to compute tan(22.5°). I remember that 22.5 degrees is half of 45 degrees, so I can use the half-angle formula for tangent.The half-angle formula is tan(θ/2) = (1 - cosθ) / sinθ. Let me apply that with θ = 45°. So, tan(22.5°) = tan(45°/2) = (1 - cos45°) / sin45°.I know that cos45° is √2/2 and sin45° is also √2/2. Plugging these in, we get tan(22.5°) = (1 - √2/2) / (√2/2). Let me simplify that.First, the numerator is 1 - √2/2, which can be written as (2 - √2)/2. The denominator is √2/2. So, dividing these two fractions: [(2 - √2)/2] / [√2/2] = (2 - √2)/√2.Simplify further by rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √2. That gives [(2 - √2)√2] / (√2 * √2) = [2√2 - (√2 * √2)] / 2 = [2√2 - 2] / 2.Factor out a 2 in the numerator: 2(√2 - 1)/2 = √2 - 1. So, tan(22.5°) = √2 - 1.Therefore, the apothem is (a/2) divided by (√2 - 1). Let me write that as (a/2) / (√2 - 1). To rationalize the denominator, I can multiply numerator and denominator by (√2 + 1).So, apothem = (a/2) * (√2 + 1) / [(√2 - 1)(√2 + 1)]. The denominator simplifies as (√2)^2 - (1)^2 = 2 - 1 = 1. So, apothem = (a/2)(√2 + 1).So, apothem = a(√2 + 1)/2.Now, going back to the area formula: Area = (1/2) * perimeter * apothem. The perimeter is 8a, and the apothem is a(√2 + 1)/2.Plugging these in: Area = (1/2) * 8a * [a(√2 + 1)/2]. Let me compute this step by step.First, (1/2) * 8a = 4a. Then, 4a multiplied by [a(√2 + 1)/2] is 4a * [a(√2 + 1)/2] = (4a * a)(√2 + 1)/2 = (4a²)(√2 + 1)/2.Simplify 4/2 to 2: 2a²(√2 + 1). So, the area is 2a²(√2 + 1).Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a miscalculation.Starting from Area = (1/2) * 8a * [a(√2 + 1)/2].Compute (1/2) * 8a: that's 4a.Then, 4a multiplied by [a(√2 + 1)/2] is (4a * a)(√2 + 1)/2 = (4a²)(√2 + 1)/2.Yes, that's correct. 4 divided by 2 is 2, so 2a²(√2 + 1). So, the area is 2a²(√2 + 1).Alternatively, I can write that as 2(√2 + 1)a².But let me see if there's another way to derive this, just to confirm.Another method I remember is dividing the octagon into geometric shapes whose areas I can calculate and then sum them up. A regular octagon can be thought of as a square with its corners cut off, each corner being a right-angled isosceles triangle.Let me try this approach. Suppose I start with a square and cut off each corner to make an octagon. Each corner cut is a right-angled isosceles triangle because the sides of the octagon are equal and the angles are equal.Let me denote the side length of the octagon as 'a'. When I cut off a triangle from each corner, the legs of each triangle are equal, let's say each leg is length 'x'. Then, the hypotenuse of each triangle is x√2, since it's a right-angled isosceles triangle.Now, the original square has side length equal to the side length of the octagon plus twice the length 'x', because each side of the square is reduced by 2x when we cut off the triangles from both ends. So, the original square has side length S = a + 2x.But wait, actually, the side length of the octagon is 'a', which is the length of the side after cutting off the triangles. So, each side of the square is divided into a middle segment of length 'a' and two segments of length 'x' at each end. So, the original square's side length is a + 2x.However, the hypotenuse of each triangle is the side of the octagon, which is 'a'. Wait, no, that's not correct. The hypotenuse of each triangle is actually the side of the octagon, which is 'a'. So, the hypotenuse is a, which is equal to x√2. Therefore, x = a / √2.So, each leg of the triangle is a / √2. Therefore, the original square had side length S = a + 2x = a + 2*(a / √2) = a + (2a)/√2 = a + a√2.Simplify that: a(1 + √2). So, the original square had side length a(1 + √2). The area of the original square is [a(1 + √2)]² = a²(1 + 2√2 + 2) = a²(3 + 2√2).Now, each corner triangle has legs of length x = a / √2, so the area of each triangle is (1/2)*x² = (1/2)*(a² / 2) = a² / 4.There are 4 corners, so the total area removed is 4*(a² / 4) = a².Therefore, the area of the octagon is the area of the square minus the area of the four triangles: [a²(3 + 2√2)] - a² = a²(3 + 2√2 - 1) = a²(2 + 2√2) = 2a²(1 + √2).Wait, that's the same result as before! So, 2a²(1 + √2) is the area. So, that's consistent with the first method.Alternatively, I can also think of the octagon as being composed of 8 isosceles triangles, each with a vertex angle of 45 degrees, as I initially considered. Each of these triangles has a base of length 'a' and two sides equal to the radius 'R' of the circumscribed circle.But in this case, I can compute the area of each triangle and then multiply by 8. The area of each triangle is (1/2)*base*height, where the base is 'a' and the height is the apothem, which we found earlier to be a(√2 + 1)/2.So, area of one triangle is (1/2)*a*(a(√2 + 1)/2) = (a²(√2 + 1))/4.Multiply by 8: 8*(a²(√2 + 1))/4 = 2a²(√2 + 1). Same result again.So, all three methods give me the same area: 2(1 + √2)a².Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second method. When I considered the octagon as a square with the corners cut off, I assumed that the hypotenuse of each triangle is equal to the side length 'a' of the octagon. Is that correct?Yes, because when you cut off a corner of the square, the new side created is the hypotenuse of the triangle, which becomes a side of the octagon. So, that hypotenuse is indeed length 'a'.Therefore, the calculations seem correct. So, the area is 2(1 + √2)a².Alternatively, sometimes the area is written as 2(√2 + 1)a², which is the same thing.Just to double-check, I can look up the formula for the area of a regular octagon. I recall that it's 2(1 + √2)s², where 's' is the side length. So, in this case, s = a, so the area is 2(1 + √2)a². Yep, that matches what I got.Therefore, I'm confident that the area of a regular octagon with side length 'a' is 2(1 + √2)a².**Final Answer**The area of the regular octagon is boxed{2(1 + sqrt{2})a^2}."},{"question":"The algebraic expressions (a+b c) and ((a+b)(a+c)) are:(A) Equal.(B) Never equal.(C) Equal when (a+b+c=1).(D) Equal when (a+b+c=0).(E) Equal only when (a=b=c=0).(6th Annual High School Mathematics Examination, 1955)","answer":"Okay, so I have this algebra problem here. It says: The algebraic expressions (a + bc) and ((a + b)(a + c)) are: and then there are five options. I need to figure out when these two expressions are equal. Let me try to work through this step by step.First, let me write down both expressions so I can see them clearly.The first expression is (a + bc). That's straightforward—just a linear term in (a) and a product term of (b) and (c).The second expression is ((a + b)(a + c)). Hmm, that looks like a product of two binomials. I remember that when you multiply two binomials, you can use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method—First, Outer, Inner, Last.Let me expand ((a + b)(a + c)) using the distributive property.First, I'll distribute (a) to both terms in the second binomial: (a times a = a^2) and (a times c = ac).Then, I'll distribute (b) to both terms in the second binomial: (b times a = ab) and (b times c = bc).So, putting it all together, the expanded form is (a^2 + ac + ab + bc).Wait, let me write that again to make sure I didn't miss anything:[(a + b)(a + c) = a times a + a times c + b times a + b times c = a^2 + ac + ab + bc]Yes, that looks correct. So, the expanded form is (a^2 + ac + ab + bc).Now, the problem is asking when (a + bc) is equal to ((a + b)(a + c)). So, I can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for the condition.Let me write that equation:[a + bc = (a + b)(a + c)]But I just expanded the right-hand side, so substitute that in:[a + bc = a^2 + ac + ab + bc]Hmm, okay. Let me subtract (a + bc) from both sides to bring everything to one side of the equation:[0 = a^2 + ac + ab + bc - a - bc]Simplify the right-hand side. Let's see:First, (a^2) remains.Then, (ac) remains.Then, (ab) remains.Then, (bc - bc) cancels out, so that's zero.Then, subtract (a), so we have (-a).So, combining like terms, we have:[0 = a^2 + ac + ab - a]I can factor out an (a) from each term on the right-hand side:[0 = a(a + c + b - 1)]Wait, let me check that. If I factor (a) out of each term:- (a^2 = a times a)- (ac = a times c)- (ab = a times b)- (-a = a times (-1))So, yes, factoring out (a), we get:[0 = a(a + b + c - 1)]So, the equation simplifies to:[a(a + b + c - 1) = 0]This equation is satisfied if either factor is zero. So, either (a = 0) or (a + b + c - 1 = 0).Which means, either (a = 0) or (a + b + c = 1).So, the two expressions (a + bc) and ((a + b)(a + c)) are equal when either (a = 0) or (a + b + c = 1).Looking back at the options given:(A) Equal.(B) Never equal.(C) Equal when (a + b + c = 1).(D) Equal when (a + b + c = 0).(E) Equal only when (a = b = c = 0).Hmm, so according to my solution, the expressions are equal when (a = 0) or when (a + b + c = 1). So, that means they are equal in more cases than just when (a + b + c = 1). But option (C) says they are equal when (a + b + c = 1), which is one of the cases. However, the expressions are also equal when (a = 0), regardless of the values of (b) and (c).But wait, let me think again. If (a = 0), then the first expression becomes (0 + bc = bc). The second expression becomes ((0 + b)(0 + c) = bc). So, yes, they are equal when (a = 0).So, the expressions are equal in two cases: either (a = 0) or (a + b + c = 1). So, the expressions are equal when (a + b + c = 1) or when (a = 0). So, that means they are equal in more cases than just when (a + b + c = 1). So, does that mean option (C) is correct? Or is there a better option?Looking at the options:(A) Equal. That would mean they are always equal, which is not the case because if I choose some values where (a neq 0) and (a + b + c neq 1), the expressions won't be equal.For example, let me test with (a = 1), (b = 1), (c = 1). Then, the first expression is (1 + 1*1 = 2). The second expression is ((1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2*2 = 4). So, 2 ≠ 4, so they are not always equal. So, (A) is incorrect.(B) Never equal. Well, we just saw that they are equal when (a = 0) or (a + b + c = 1), so they are sometimes equal, so (B) is incorrect.(C) Equal when (a + b + c = 1). Well, that is one of the cases, but not the only case. So, is (C) correct? Or is there a more precise option?(D) Equal when (a + b + c = 0). Hmm, let me test this. If (a + b + c = 0), does that make (a + bc = (a + b)(a + c))?Let me pick (a = 1), (b = -1), (c = 0). Then, (a + b + c = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0). The first expression is (1 + (-1)(0) = 1 + 0 = 1). The second expression is ((1 + (-1))(1 + 0) = (0)(1) = 0). So, 1 ≠ 0, so when (a + b + c = 0), the expressions are not necessarily equal. So, (D) is incorrect.(E) Equal only when (a = b = c = 0). Well, let's test that. If (a = b = c = 0), then both expressions are 0, so they are equal. But earlier, we saw that they are equal when (a = 0) regardless of (b) and (c), or when (a + b + c = 1). So, there are other cases where they are equal besides all being zero. So, (E) is incorrect.So, looking back, the only correct option is (C): Equal when (a + b + c = 1). But wait, earlier I thought that they are equal when (a = 0) or (a + b + c = 1). So, why isn't (C) incorrect because it's not the only case?Wait, the question is asking \\"The algebraic expressions (a + bc) and ((a + b)(a + c)) are: (A) Equal. (B) Never equal. (C) Equal when (a + b + c = 1). (D) Equal when (a + b + c = 0). (E) Equal only when (a = b = c = 0).\\"So, the question is not asking for all cases when they are equal, but rather, which of the options is correct. So, (C) says they are equal when (a + b + c = 1). That is a correct statement because when (a + b + c = 1), the expressions are equal. However, they are also equal when (a = 0), but since (C) is a correct statement, even though it's not the only case, it's still a correct answer.Wait, but hold on. Let me check the options again. Option (C) says \\"Equal when (a + b + c = 1)\\", which is a correct condition, but the expressions are equal in more cases. However, none of the options mention both conditions. So, since (C) is a correct condition, even though it's not the only one, is it the best answer? Or is there a better way to interpret the question?Wait, the question is phrased as \\"The algebraic expressions (a + bc) and ((a + b)(a + c)) are: (A) Equal. (B) Never equal. (C) Equal when (a + b + c = 1). (D) Equal when (a + b + c = 0). (E) Equal only when (a = b = c = 0).\\"So, it's asking about the relationship between the two expressions. So, (A) says they are always equal, which is false. (B) says they are never equal, which is false because we have cases where they are equal. (C) says they are equal when (a + b + c = 1), which is true. (D) says they are equal when (a + b + c = 0), which is false, as shown earlier. (E) says they are equal only when all variables are zero, which is false because they can be equal in other cases.Therefore, the correct answer is (C). Even though the expressions can be equal in more cases, (C) is a correct statement about when they are equal. The question doesn't specify that it's the only condition, just that it's a condition.Wait, but hold on, let me think again. If the question had said \\"Equal only when...\\", then (C) would be incorrect because there are other cases. But since (C) just says \\"Equal when...\\", it's a correct statement. So, (C) is correct.Alternatively, if the question had asked for all cases, but since it's giving options, and (C) is a correct case, it's the right answer.So, I think (C) is the correct choice.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Determine the value of the definite integral int_{-frac{pi}{2}}^{frac{pi}{2}} (sin x + cos x) dx.","answer":"Okay, so I have this integral to solve: the definite integral from -π/2 to π/2 of (sin x + cos x) dx. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that integrals can be split into sums, so maybe I can separate this into two separate integrals. That is, the integral of sin x plus the integral of cos x. Yeah, that should work because integration is linear.So, let me write that down:∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} (sin x + cos x) dx = ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} sin x dx + ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} cos x dx.Alright, now I need to compute each of these integrals separately. Let's start with the first one: the integral of sin x. I recall that the integral of sin x is -cos x + C, where C is the constant of integration. But since we're dealing with definite integrals, the constants will cancel out when we evaluate the limits.So, computing the first integral:∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} sin x dx = [-cos x]_{-π/2}^{π/2}.Now, plugging in the upper limit first: -cos(π/2). I know that cos(π/2) is 0, so this becomes -0, which is 0. Then, plugging in the lower limit: -cos(-π/2). Hmm, cosine is an even function, so cos(-π/2) is equal to cos(π/2), which is also 0. So, this becomes -0 as well, which is 0.Wait, so the first integral is 0 - 0 = 0? That seems right because sin x is an odd function, and integrating an odd function over symmetric limits around zero gives zero. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the first integral is zero.Now, moving on to the second integral: ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} cos x dx. I remember that the integral of cos x is sin x + C. Again, since it's a definite integral, the constants will cancel.So, let's compute that:∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} cos x dx = [sin x]_{-π/2}^{π/2}.Evaluating at the upper limit: sin(π/2). I know that sin(π/2) is 1. Then, evaluating at the lower limit: sin(-π/2). Sin is an odd function, so sin(-π/2) is -sin(π/2), which is -1.So, putting it all together: 1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2.Therefore, the second integral is 2.Now, adding the two results together: 0 + 2 = 2.Wait, so the value of the definite integral is 2? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First integral: sin x is odd, so integrating from -a to a gives zero. That seems correct. Second integral: cos x is even, so integrating from -a to a is twice the integral from 0 to a. Let me verify that.Alternatively, I can compute the second integral as 2 times the integral from 0 to π/2 of cos x dx, since cos x is even. So, 2*[sin x]_0^{π/2} = 2*(1 - 0) = 2. Yep, that matches what I got earlier. So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, I could have thought about the entire function sin x + cos x. Is this function even or odd? Let's see: sin(-x) + cos(-x) = -sin x + cos x. So, it's neither even nor odd because it's not equal to sin x + cos x nor its negative. So, I can't directly apply the even-odd properties to the entire function, which is why I split it into two separate integrals.But since I split it into sin x and cos x, and sin x is odd and cos x is even, integrating over symmetric limits, the odd part cancels out and the even part doubles. So, that's another way to see why the integral is 2.Just to make sure, let me compute the integral without splitting it. So, ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} (sin x + cos x) dx. The antiderivative would be -cos x + sin x. Evaluating from -π/2 to π/2.So, at π/2: -cos(π/2) + sin(π/2) = -0 + 1 = 1.At -π/2: -cos(-π/2) + sin(-π/2) = -0 + (-1) = -1.Subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit: 1 - (-1) = 2.Yep, same result. So, that confirms it.I think I'm confident that the value of the integral is 2.**Final Answer**The value of the definite integral is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Given the polynomial -3a^{2}b+frac{5}{2}{a^2}{b^3}-ab+1, the degree of this polynomial is ____.","answer":"First, I need to identify each term in the polynomial (-3a^{2}b + frac{5}{2}a^{2}b^{3} - ab + 1).Next, I'll determine the degree of each term by adding the exponents of the variables in that term.For the term (-3a^{2}b), the exponents are 2 for (a) and 1 for (b), so the degree is (2 + 1 = 3).For the term (frac{5}{2}a^{2}b^{3}), the exponents are 2 for (a) and 3 for (b), so the degree is (2 + 3 = 5).For the term (-ab), the exponents are 1 for both (a) and (b), so the degree is (1 + 1 = 2).The constant term (1) has a degree of 0.Finally, the degree of the polynomial is the highest degree among its terms, which is 5."},{"question":"In the diagram, square (PQRS) has side length 40.

What is the area of quadrilateral (WXYZ)?(A) 280(B) 200(C) 320(D) 240(E) 160","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about a square PQRS with side length 40. Points J, K, L, and M are on the sides of the square such that JQ = KR = LS = MP = 10. Then there are line segments JZ, KW, LX, and MY drawn parallel to the diagonals of the square, and these segments intersect in such a way that W is on JZ, X is on KW, Y is on LX, and Z is on MY. The question is asking for the area of quadrilateral WXYZ. The options are 280, 200, 320, 240, and 160.First, I need to visualize the square PQRS. Let me sketch it mentally. Let's assume it's a standard square with points labeled clockwise: P at the top-left, Q at the top-right, R at the bottom-right, and S at the bottom-left. So, PQ is the top side, QR is the right side, RS is the bottom side, and SP is the left side.Points J, K, L, M are on the sides. Specifically, JQ = 10, so J is 10 units away from Q on side PQ. Similarly, KR = 10, so K is 10 units away from R on side QR. LS = 10, so L is 10 units away from S on side RS. MP = 10, so M is 10 units away from P on side SP.So, let's assign coordinates to the square to make it easier. Let me place point P at (0, 40), Q at (40, 40), R at (40, 0), and S at (0, 0). So, the square is 40 units on each side.Now, point J is on PQ, 10 units from Q. Since PQ is from (0,40) to (40,40), moving right. So, J is 10 units left from Q, so J is at (30, 40).Point K is on QR, 10 units from R. QR goes from (40,40) to (40,0). So, moving down from Q to R. So, K is 10 units above R, so at (40, 10).Point L is on RS, 10 units from S. RS goes from (40,0) to (0,0). So, moving left from R to S. So, L is 10 units right from S, so at (10, 0).Point M is on SP, 10 units from P. SP goes from (0,0) to (0,40). So, moving up from S to P. So, M is 10 units below P, so at (0, 30).Alright, so we have points J(30,40), K(40,10), L(10,0), and M(0,30).Now, line segments JZ, KW, LX, and MY are drawn parallel to the diagonals of the square. The diagonals of the square are PR and QS. PR goes from (0,40) to (40,0), so its slope is (0-40)/(40-0) = -1. QS goes from (40,40) to (0,0), so its slope is (0-40)/(0-40) = 1.So, the diagonals have slopes of -1 and 1. Therefore, the line segments JZ, KW, LX, and MY are either parallel to PR (slope -1) or QS (slope 1). Wait, the problem says they are drawn parallel to the diagonals, but doesn't specify which one. Hmm.Wait, let me read again: \\"Line segments JZ, KW, LX, and MY are drawn parallel to the diagonals of the square so that W is on JZ, X is on KW, Y is on LX, and Z is on MY.\\"Hmm, so each of these segments is parallel to a diagonal, but it's not specified which one. So, perhaps each is alternately parallel to PR and QS? Or maybe all are parallel to one diagonal? Hmm, not sure.Wait, maybe the way they are connected is such that each segment is parallel to one of the diagonals. Let me think.Since W is on JZ, X is on KW, Y is on LX, and Z is on MY, it's forming a quadrilateral WXYZ inside the square.Perhaps it's better to assign coordinates to all these points and find equations of the lines, then find the intersection points W, X, Y, Z.So, let's start by figuring out which segments are parallel to which diagonals.Since JZ is connected to J, which is at (30,40). If JZ is parallel to a diagonal, it could be either slope 1 or -1.Similarly, KW is connected to K(40,10). LX is connected to L(10,0). MY is connected to M(0,30).Wait, perhaps each of these segments is parallel to one of the diagonals. So, maybe JZ is parallel to PR (slope -1), KW is parallel to QS (slope 1), LX is parallel to PR (slope -1), and MY is parallel to QS (slope 1). That would make sense because then the segments would intersect each other appropriately.Alternatively, maybe JZ is parallel to QS (slope 1), KW is parallel to PR (slope -1), and so on. Hmm.Wait, perhaps it's better to figure out based on the direction.Let me try to figure out the direction of each segment.Starting with JZ: from J(30,40). If it's parallel to PR (slope -1), then the line would go from (30,40) with slope -1. Similarly, if it's parallel to QS (slope 1), it would go from (30,40) with slope 1.Similarly, KW: from K(40,10). If it's parallel to PR (slope -1), then the line would go from (40,10) with slope -1. If it's parallel to QS (slope 1), then slope 1.Same for LX: from L(10,0). If parallel to PR, slope -1; if parallel to QS, slope 1.MY: from M(0,30). If parallel to PR, slope -1; if parallel to QS, slope 1.Now, since W is on JZ, X is on KW, Y is on LX, and Z is on MY, forming quadrilateral WXYZ.I think the key is that each segment is alternately parallel to the two diagonals. Let me assume that:- JZ is parallel to PR (slope -1)- KW is parallel to QS (slope 1)- LX is parallel to PR (slope -1)- MY is parallel to QS (slope 1)So, let's write the equations for each of these lines.First, JZ: from J(30,40) with slope -1.Equation: y - 40 = -1(x - 30) => y = -x + 30 + 40 => y = -x + 70.Second, KW: from K(40,10) with slope 1.Equation: y - 10 = 1*(x - 40) => y = x - 40 + 10 => y = x - 30.Third, LX: from L(10,0) with slope -1.Equation: y - 0 = -1(x - 10) => y = -x + 10.Fourth, MY: from M(0,30) with slope 1.Equation: y - 30 = 1*(x - 0) => y = x + 30.Now, we need to find the intersection points W, X, Y, Z.Wait, but according to the problem, W is on JZ, X is on KW, Y is on LX, and Z is on MY. So, W is the intersection of JZ and KW? Wait, no. Wait, let me re-read.\\"Line segments JZ, KW, LX, and MY are drawn parallel to the diagonals of the square so that W is on JZ, X is on KW, Y is on LX, and Z is on MY.\\"Hmm, maybe it's a cyclic intersection. So, W is the intersection of JZ and KW? Wait, no, because W is on JZ, and X is on KW, but how are they connected?Wait, perhaps it's a chain: JZ is connected to W, which is on JZ, then KW is connected to X, which is on KW, then LX is connected to Y, which is on LX, then MY is connected to Z, which is on MY. So, forming a quadrilateral WXYZ.Wait, maybe it's better to think that W is the intersection of JZ and KW, X is the intersection of KW and LX, Y is the intersection of LX and MY, and Z is the intersection of MY and JZ. So, forming a quadrilateral WXYZ inside the square.Yes, that makes sense. So, W is the intersection of JZ and KW, X is the intersection of KW and LX, Y is the intersection of LX and MY, and Z is the intersection of MY and JZ.So, let's compute these intersections.First, find W: intersection of JZ (y = -x + 70) and KW (y = x - 30).Set -x + 70 = x - 30.Solving: -x + 70 = x - 30 => 70 + 30 = x + x => 100 = 2x => x = 50.But wait, x = 50? But the square only goes up to x = 40. That can't be right. Hmm, that suggests that my assumption about the slopes might be wrong.Wait, if x = 50, which is outside the square, that can't be. So, perhaps my initial assumption about the slopes is incorrect.Wait, maybe JZ is parallel to QS (slope 1) instead of PR (slope -1). Let me try that.So, if JZ is parallel to QS, which has slope 1, then equation of JZ is y - 40 = 1*(x - 30) => y = x + 10.Similarly, let's adjust the other lines.KW: If it's parallel to PR (slope -1), then equation is y - 10 = -1*(x - 40) => y = -x + 50.LX: If it's parallel to QS (slope 1), equation is y - 0 = 1*(x - 10) => y = x - 10.MY: If it's parallel to PR (slope -1), equation is y - 30 = -1*(x - 0) => y = -x + 30.Now, let's find the intersections again.First, W is the intersection of JZ (y = x + 10) and KW (y = -x + 50).Set x + 10 = -x + 50 => 2x = 40 => x = 20. Then y = 20 + 10 = 30. So, W is at (20, 30).Second, X is the intersection of KW (y = -x + 50) and LX (y = x - 10).Set -x + 50 = x - 10 => -2x = -60 => x = 30. Then y = 30 - 10 = 20. So, X is at (30, 20).Third, Y is the intersection of LX (y = x - 10) and MY (y = -x + 30).Set x - 10 = -x + 30 => 2x = 40 => x = 20. Then y = 20 - 10 = 10. So, Y is at (20, 10).Fourth, Z is the intersection of MY (y = -x + 30) and JZ (y = x + 10).Set -x + 30 = x + 10 => -2x = -20 => x = 10. Then y = 10 + 10 = 20. So, Z is at (10, 20).Wait, so now we have quadrilateral WXYZ with points W(20,30), X(30,20), Y(20,10), and Z(10,20).Wait, let me plot these points mentally. W is at (20,30), which is on the left side of the square, X is at (30,20), which is on the right side, Y is at (20,10), which is on the left side, and Z is at (10,20), which is on the left side. Hmm, actually, these points form a quadrilateral that is symmetric in some way.Wait, let me list the coordinates again:- W: (20,30)- X: (30,20)- Y: (20,10)- Z: (10,20)So, connecting W to X to Y to Z and back to W.Hmm, to find the area of quadrilateral WXYZ, I can use the shoelace formula.First, let's list the coordinates in order:(20,30), (30,20), (20,10), (10,20), and back to (20,30).Shoelace formula:Area = 1/2 |sum over i (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|So, compute each term:First pair: (20,30) and (30,20)Term: 20*20 - 30*30 = 400 - 900 = -500Second pair: (30,20) and (20,10)Term: 30*10 - 20*20 = 300 - 400 = -100Third pair: (20,10) and (10,20)Term: 20*20 - 10*10 = 400 - 100 = 300Fourth pair: (10,20) and (20,30)Term: 10*30 - 20*20 = 300 - 400 = -100Now, sum these terms: -500 -100 + 300 -100 = (-500 -100) + (300 -100) = (-600) + (200) = -400Take absolute value: | -400 | = 400Multiply by 1/2: 1/2 * 400 = 200So, the area is 200.Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have messed up the order or the multiplication.Let me write the coordinates in order:1. (20,30)2. (30,20)3. (20,10)4. (10,20)5. (20,30)Compute the shoelace sums:Sum1: (20*20) + (30*10) + (20*20) + (10*30)= 400 + 300 + 400 + 300= 1400Sum2: (30*30) + (20*20) + (10*10) + (20*20)= 900 + 400 + 100 + 400= 1800Area = 1/2 |Sum1 - Sum2| = 1/2 |1400 - 1800| = 1/2 | -400 | = 200Yes, same result. So, the area is 200, which is option (B).But wait, just to make sure, let me visualize the quadrilateral again.Points W(20,30), X(30,20), Y(20,10), Z(10,20). So, plotting these, W is on the left side near the top, X is on the right side in the middle, Y is on the left side near the bottom, and Z is on the left side in the middle. Connecting these, it seems like a kite-shaped quadrilateral. The shoelace formula gave 200, which is one of the options, option (B).Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area by breaking it into triangles or something else.Alternatively, notice that the quadrilateral is symmetric with respect to the vertical line x=20. Because W and Y are both at x=20, and X and Z are symmetric around x=20.Wait, no, actually, X is at (30,20) and Z is at (10,20), so they are symmetric across x=20. Similarly, W is at (20,30) and Y is at (20,10), so they are symmetric across y=20.Therefore, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram? Wait, no, because the sides are not necessarily parallel.Wait, but given the symmetry, perhaps it's a rhombus or something else.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the vectors of the sides and see.Vector WX: from (20,30) to (30,20): (10, -10)Vector XY: from (30,20) to (20,10): (-10, -10)Vector YZ: from (20,10) to (10,20): (-10,10)Vector ZW: from (10,20) to (20,30): (10,10)Hmm, so the sides are vectors (10,-10), (-10,-10), (-10,10), (10,10). It seems like the opposite sides are equal and parallel? Let's see:WX: (10,-10) and YZ: (-10,10). Wait, not exactly, because YZ is (-10,10), which is the negative of (10,-10). So, WX and YZ are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, meaning they are parallel.Similarly, XY: (-10,-10) and ZW: (10,10). Again, ZW is the negative of XY, so they are parallel.Therefore, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.In a parallelogram, the area can be found by the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides.So, vectors WX = (10,-10) and WY = (0,-20). Wait, no, WY is from W(20,30) to Y(20,10), which is (0,-20). Alternatively, maybe vectors from W.Wait, actually, in a parallelogram, the area is base times height, but since we have vectors, the area is the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides.So, vectors from W: let's take vector WX = (10,-10) and vector WZ. Wait, WZ is from W(20,30) to Z(10,20): (-10,-10).So, cross product of WX and WZ is (10)(-10) - (-10)(-10) = -100 - 100 = -200. The magnitude is 200, so area is 200.Same result as before.Therefore, I'm confident the area is 200, which is option (B).**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Three people, A, B, and C, are taking an elevator from the 1st floor to the 3rd to 7th floors of a mall. Each floor can accommodate at most 2 people getting off the elevator. How many ways are there for them to get off the elevator?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where three people, A, B, and C, are taking an elevator from the 1st floor to the 3rd to 7th floors of a mall. Each floor can accommodate at most 2 people getting off the elevator. I need to figure out how many ways there are for them to get off the elevator. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.First, let me understand the problem correctly. We have three people in an elevator starting at the 1st floor. The elevator goes up to floors 3 through 7, so that's floors 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Each of these floors can have at most 2 people getting off. So, I need to count all the possible ways that A, B, and C can exit the elevator on these floors, with the condition that no more than two people get off on any single floor.I think this is a combinatorial problem where I have to distribute three distinct objects (people) into five distinct boxes (floors 3 to 7), with each box holding at most two objects. Since the people are distinct, the order in which they exit matters, but each floor can only have up to two people exiting. Let me recall some combinatorial principles. When distributing distinct objects into distinct boxes with certain restrictions, we can use the multiplication principle or inclusion-exclusion. In this case, since each person has five choices (floors 3-7), without any restrictions, the total number of ways would be 5^3 = 125. But we have a restriction: no more than two people can get off on any single floor. So, we need to subtract the cases where all three people get off on the same floor.How many such cases are there? Well, for each floor, there's only one way where all three get off there, right? Since all three people have to choose that floor. So, for each of the five floors, there's one such case. Therefore, the number of invalid cases is 5.So, subtracting these from the total, we get 125 - 5 = 120. Is that the answer? Wait, hold on. Let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem?Alternatively, maybe I can model this as assigning each person a floor, with the constraint that no floor is assigned to all three. Since each person independently chooses a floor, and the choices are independent, the total number is indeed 5^3 = 125. Then, subtract the cases where all three choose the same floor, which is 5, so 125 - 5 = 120. That seems straightforward.But let me verify this another way to make sure I haven't missed anything. Maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.The total number of ways without any restrictions is 5^3 = 125. Now, the number of ways where at least one floor has all three people getting off is equal to the number of floors times the number of ways all three can get off on that floor. Since each floor can be such a case, and there are 5 floors, that's 5 * 1 = 5. So, subtracting these, we get 125 - 5 = 120. Wait, but inclusion-exclusion usually involves more steps when there are overlapping cases, but in this problem, the only restriction is that no floor can have all three people. There's no restriction on having two people on a floor, so I don't need to worry about subtracting cases where two floors each have two people or something like that because those are still valid. The only invalid cases are the ones where all three get off on the same floor.So, I think my initial reasoning is correct. The total number of valid ways is 120.But just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe considering the different distributions of people across the floors.Since each floor can have at most two people, and we have three people, the possible distributions are:1. One floor has two people, and another floor has one person. The third floor has zero people.2. All three people get off on different floors.Wait, but in the problem statement, it's specified that each floor can accommodate at most two people getting off. So, actually, the case where all three get off on different floors is allowed because each floor only has one person, which is less than the maximum of two. So, that case is valid.But in my earlier approach, I considered all possible assignments except those where all three are on the same floor. So, that includes both distributions where two are on one floor and one on another, and all three on separate floors.So, maybe I can calculate the number of ways for each distribution and sum them up.First, let's calculate the number of ways where all three people get off on different floors. Since each person must choose a different floor, and there are five floors, the number of ways is the number of permutations of 5 floors taken 3 at a time. That is, P(5,3) = 5 * 4 * 3 = 60.Next, the number of ways where two people get off on one floor and the third person gets off on another floor. To calculate this, we can break it down into steps:1. Choose which two people will get off together. There are C(3,2) = 3 ways to choose these two people.2. Choose the floor where these two people will get off. There are 5 choices.3. Choose the floor where the remaining person will get off. Since it has to be a different floor from the one chosen in step 2, there are 4 choices.So, the total number of ways for this distribution is 3 * 5 * 4 = 60.Adding these two cases together: 60 (all different floors) + 60 (two on one floor, one on another) = 120. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the total number of ways is 120.Wait, but let me think again. Is there another possible distribution? For example, could two floors each have two people? But since we only have three people, that's not possible because two floors with two people each would require four people. So, that's not applicable here. So, the only distributions are either all three on different floors or two on one floor and one on another.Therefore, adding those two cases gives the total number of valid ways, which is 120.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each person has 5 choices, so 5^3 = 125. Then, subtract the cases where all three choose the same floor, which is 5, so 125 - 5 = 120. So, that's consistent.I think I've approached this problem from multiple angles now: directly counting the valid distributions, using permutations and combinations, and also using the principle of subtracting invalid cases from the total. All methods lead me to the same answer of 120.Just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other restriction or detail I might have missed. The problem states that each floor can accommodate at most two people getting off. So, getting off on the same floor is allowed as long as it's not more than two. Since we have three people, the only forbidden case is all three getting off on the same floor. So, that's why we subtract those 5 cases.Is there a possibility that the elevator starts on the 1st floor, so do people have the option to get off on the 1st floor? The problem says they're taking the elevator from the 1st floor to the 3rd to 7th floors. So, I think the 1st floor is the starting point, and they can only get off from the 3rd to the 7th floors. So, they can't get off on the 2nd floor or the 1st floor. So, the possible floors are only 3,4,5,6,7, which are five floors.Therefore, each person has exactly five choices, and the only invalid cases are when all three choose the same floor. So, 5^3 - 5 = 120.I think that's solid. I don't see any other restrictions or cases I need to consider. So, I feel confident that the answer is 120.**Final Answer**The number of ways for them to get off the elevator is boxed{120}."},{"question":"Given that ( n ) is a two-digit natural number. When ( n ) is divided by 9, the remainder is 1, and when ( n ) is divided by 10, the remainder is 3. What is the remainder when ( n ) is divided by 11?(A) 0(B) 2(C) 4(D) 5(E) 7","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when a two-digit number ( n ) is divided by 11. The problem gives me two conditions: when ( n ) is divided by 9, the remainder is 1, and when ( n ) is divided by 10, the remainder is 3. The options are (A) 0, (B) 2, (C) 4, (D) 5, and (E) 7. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let me write down what I know. Since ( n ) is a two-digit number, it's between 10 and 99 inclusive. The first condition is that when ( n ) is divided by 9, the remainder is 1. So mathematically, that can be written as:[n equiv 1 pmod{9}]Which means ( n = 9k + 1 ) for some integer ( k ). Similarly, the second condition is that when ( n ) is divided by 10, the remainder is 3. So:[n equiv 3 pmod{10}]Which means ( n = 10m + 3 ) for some integer ( m ).So, ( n ) can be expressed in two different ways:1. ( n = 9k + 1 )2. ( n = 10m + 3 )Since both expressions equal ( n ), I can set them equal to each other:[9k + 1 = 10m + 3]Let me rearrange this equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Subtract 1 from both sides:[9k = 10m + 2]Then, subtract 10m from both sides:[9k - 10m = 2]Hmm, this is a linear Diophantine equation. I need to find integer solutions ( k ) and ( m ) such that this equation holds. Since ( n ) is a two-digit number, ( k ) and ( m ) can't be too large.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this by looking at the possible values of ( n ) that satisfy both conditions. Let's see.From the second condition, ( n equiv 3 pmod{10} ), so the units digit of ( n ) must be 3. Therefore, ( n ) can be 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, or 93. These are all the two-digit numbers ending with 3.Now, let's check which of these numbers leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 9. So, for each of these numbers, I can compute ( n mod 9 ) and see if it equals 1.Let's compute:1. 13 divided by 9: 9*1=9, 13-9=4. So remainder is 4. Not 1.2. 23 divided by 9: 9*2=18, 23-18=5. Remainder is 5. Not 1.3. 33 divided by 9: 9*3=27, 33-27=6. Remainder is 6. Not 1.4. 43 divided by 9: 9*4=36, 43-36=7. Remainder is 7. Not 1.5. 53 divided by 9: 9*5=45, 53-45=8. Remainder is 8. Not 1.6. 63 divided by 9: 9*7=63, 63-63=0. Remainder is 0. Not 1.7. 73 divided by 9: 9*8=72, 73-72=1. Remainder is 1. Bingo!8. 83 divided by 9: 9*9=81, 83-81=2. Remainder is 2. Not 1.9. 93 divided by 9: 9*10=90, 93-90=3. Remainder is 3. Not 1.So, the only number in this list that satisfies both conditions is 73. Therefore, ( n = 73 ).Now, the question is asking for the remainder when ( n ) is divided by 11. So, let me compute ( 73 div 11 ).11*6=66, 73-66=7. So, the remainder is 7. Hmm, but wait, 7 is one of the options, option (E). But let me double-check because sometimes I might make a mistake.Alternatively, maybe I can use another method to verify. Since ( n = 73 ), let me compute ( 73 mod 11 ). 11*6=66, 73-66=7. So yes, remainder is 7.Wait, but let me make sure that 73 is indeed the correct number. Because sometimes when solving congruences, there might be multiple solutions, but in this case, since ( n ) is a two-digit number, and we found only one number that fits both conditions, 73 is the only solution.Alternatively, maybe I can solve the system of congruences algebraically to confirm.We have:1. ( n equiv 1 pmod{9} )2. ( n equiv 3 pmod{10} )We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) here, but since 9 and 10 are coprime, CRT tells us there is a unique solution modulo 90 (since 9*10=90). But since ( n ) is two-digit, we can find the solution within 10 to 99.Let me express ( n ) as ( n = 10m + 3 ) as before. Then, substitute into the first equation:[10m + 3 equiv 1 pmod{9}]Simplify ( 10m mod 9 ). Since 10 ≡ 1 mod 9, so 10m ≡ m mod 9. Therefore:[m + 3 equiv 1 pmod{9}]Subtract 3 from both sides:[m equiv -2 pmod{9}]Which is the same as:[m equiv 7 pmod{9}]So, ( m = 9k + 7 ) for some integer ( k ). Therefore, substituting back into ( n = 10m + 3 ):[n = 10(9k + 7) + 3 = 90k + 70 + 3 = 90k + 73]Since ( n ) is a two-digit number, ( 90k + 73 ) must be between 10 and 99. Let's find possible values of ( k ).If ( k = 0 ), ( n = 73 ). If ( k = 1 ), ( n = 163 ), which is a three-digit number, so too big. If ( k = -1 ), ( n = -17 ), which is negative, so invalid. Therefore, the only solution is ( k = 0 ), so ( n = 73 ).Thus, ( n = 73 ). Now, compute ( 73 div 11 ). 11*6=66, 73-66=7. So, the remainder is 7. Therefore, the answer should be (E) 7.Wait, but let me check if I made any mistakes in my reasoning. For example, when I substituted ( n = 10m + 3 ) into the first congruence, I correctly simplified 10m mod 9 as m mod 9 because 10 ≡ 1 mod 9. Then, m + 3 ≡ 1 mod 9, so m ≡ -2 mod 9, which is 7 mod 9. So, m = 9k + 7. Then, substituting back, n = 10*(9k +7) +3 = 90k +73. Since n is two-digit, k=0 gives 73, which is correct. So, that seems solid.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the problem differently. Since n ≡ 1 mod 9 and n ≡ 3 mod 10, perhaps I can list numbers that are 1 mod 9 and see which ones are 3 mod 10.Numbers that are 1 mod 9 are: 1, 10, 19, 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82, 91, 100, etc. But since n is two-digit, we can consider 10, 19, 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82, 91.Now, among these, which ones are 3 mod 10? That is, their units digit is 3.Looking at the list: 10 (ends with 0), 19 (9), 28 (8), 37 (7), 46 (6), 55 (5), 64 (4), 73 (3), 82 (2), 91 (1). So, only 73 ends with 3. Therefore, n=73.So, again, n=73. Divided by 11, the remainder is 7. So, answer is (E).Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I can use another approach, like solving the two congruences step by step.We have n ≡ 1 mod 9 and n ≡ 3 mod 10.Let me write n = 9a + 1. Then, substitute into the second equation:9a + 1 ≡ 3 mod 10So, 9a ≡ 2 mod 10We need to solve for a: 9a ≡ 2 mod 10Since 9 and 10 are coprime, the inverse of 9 mod 10 exists. The inverse of 9 mod 10 is 9, because 9*9=81≡1 mod10.So, multiply both sides by 9:a ≡ 2*9 mod10a ≡ 18 mod10a ≡ 8 mod10So, a =10b +8 for some integer b.Then, substitute back into n=9a +1:n=9*(10b +8)+1=90b +72 +1=90b +73Since n is two-digit, 90b +73 must be between 10 and 99.So, 90b +73 ≥10 → 90b ≥-63. Since b is integer, b≥-0.7, so b≥0.90b +73 ≤99 →90b ≤26 →b≤0.288. So, b must be 0.Thus, n=73. So, same result.Therefore, n=73. 73 divided by 11 is 6*11=66, 73-66=7. So, remainder is 7.Therefore, the answer is (E)7.Wait, but hold on. The options are (A)0, (B)2, (C)4, (D)5, (E)7. So, 7 is an option, so that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the problem in terms of the two conditions.Since n ≡3 mod10, n is 3 more than a multiple of 10. So, n=10m+3.Also, n ≡1 mod9, so 10m +3 ≡1 mod9.10m ≡-2 mod9. Since 10≡1 mod9, so 1*m≡-2 mod9, so m≡-2 mod9, which is m=9k +7.Thus, n=10*(9k +7)+3=90k +73. Since n is two-digit, k=0, so n=73. So, same result.Therefore, n=73, and 73 mod11=7.Wait, but 11*6=66, 73-66=7. So, yes, remainder is 7.Therefore, the answer is E)7.I think I've verified this multiple times, so I'm confident that 73 is the correct number, and the remainder when divided by 11 is 7.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"If log_{2x}216 = x, where x is real, then x is:textbf{(A)} text{A non-square, non-cube integer}qquadtextbf{(B)} text{A non-square, non-cube, non-integral rational number}qquadtextbf{(C)} text{An irrational number}qquadtextbf{(D)} text{A perfect square}qquadtextbf{(E)} text{A perfect cube}","answer":"Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here: If log base 2x of 216 equals x, then what is x? And there are multiple choices given. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that logarithms can be converted into exponential form. The expression log_{2x}216 = x means that (2x)^x = 216. So, I can rewrite the equation as (2x)^x = 216. That seems manageable.Now, 216 is a number I recognize. Let me factor it to see if that helps. 216 divided by 2 is 108, divided by 2 again is 54, and again by 2 is 27. So, 216 is 2^3 * 3^3. That might be useful later on.So, I have (2x)^x = 2^3 * 3^3. Hmm, maybe I can express 2x in terms of prime factors as well. Let me denote 2x as some number, say, a. Then, a^x = 216. But I don't know if that helps directly.Wait, maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to solve for x. Let me try that. Taking natural logarithm, for example, on both sides:ln((2x)^x) = ln(216)Using the logarithm power rule, this becomes:x * ln(2x) = ln(216)So, x * ln(2x) = ln(216). Hmm, that's an equation involving x both in the base and the exponent. That might be tricky to solve algebraically. Maybe I can make a substitution.Let me set y = 2x. Then, x = y/2. Substituting back into the equation:(y/2) * ln(y) = ln(216)So, (y/2) * ln(y) = ln(216). Let me write that as:(y * ln(y)) / 2 = ln(216)Multiply both sides by 2:y * ln(y) = 2 * ln(216)Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can compute the numerical value of ln(216) to see if that helps.Calculating ln(216): Since 216 is 6^3, ln(216) = ln(6^3) = 3 * ln(6). So, 2 * ln(216) is 2 * 3 * ln(6) = 6 * ln(6).So, now the equation is:y * ln(y) = 6 * ln(6)Hmm, interesting. So, y * ln(y) = 6 * ln(6). Let me see if y = 6 satisfies this equation.Plugging y = 6 into the left side: 6 * ln(6). Which is exactly equal to the right side. So, y = 6 is a solution.Therefore, y = 6, which was defined as 2x = y. So, 2x = 6, which implies x = 3.Wait, so x is 3? Let me check that in the original equation to make sure.Original equation: log_{2x}216 = x. If x = 3, then 2x = 6. So, log base 6 of 216 equals 3. Is that true?Well, 6^3 is 216, so yes, log base 6 of 216 is indeed 3. So, x = 3 is a solution.But wait, is that the only solution? Sometimes, equations involving logarithms and exponents can have multiple solutions. Let me think.The equation y * ln(y) = 6 * ln(6). We found y = 6 is a solution. Is there another y that could satisfy this?Let me consider the function f(y) = y * ln(y). The derivative f’(y) = ln(y) + 1. So, for y > 1/e, the function is increasing because ln(y) + 1 is positive. For 0 < y < 1/e, the function is decreasing because ln(y) + 1 is negative.So, since y must be positive, and in our case, y = 2x, which is the base of a logarithm, so y must be greater than 0 and not equal to 1. So, y > 0, y ≠ 1.Given that f(y) = y * ln(y) is strictly increasing for y > 1/e, and since 6 is greater than 1/e, and f(y) is increasing there, so y = 6 is the only solution in that interval.Therefore, x = 3 is the only solution.Now, looking back at the options:A) A non-square, non-cube integer.B) A non-square, non-cube, non-integral rational number.C) An irrational number.D) A perfect square.E) A perfect cube.So, x is 3, which is an integer. Is 3 a perfect square? No, because sqrt(3) is irrational. Is 3 a perfect cube? No, because cube root of 3 is also irrational. So, 3 is a non-square, non-cube integer. So, option A.Wait, but let me double-check. Is 3 a perfect square or cube? 3 is not a perfect square because 1^2=1, 2^2=4, so 3 is in between. Similarly, 1^3=1, 2^3=8, so 3 is not a perfect cube either. So, yes, 3 is a non-square, non-cube integer. So, option A is correct.But hold on, let me make sure that x=3 is the only solution. Because sometimes, when dealing with logarithmic equations, especially when the variable is in the base and the exponent, there can be multiple solutions.Wait, in this case, we had y * ln(y) = 6 * ln(6). We found y=6 is a solution. Since f(y) is strictly increasing for y > 1/e, and 6 is greater than 1/e, so y=6 is the only solution. So, x=3 is the only solution.Therefore, the answer is A.But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.Alternatively, starting from (2x)^x = 216.We can write 216 as 6^3, so (2x)^x = 6^3.So, (2x)^x = 6^3.If we can express 2x as 6, then 6^x = 6^3, which would imply x=3. So, that's the same solution as before.Alternatively, suppose 2x is not 6, but some other number. Let's say 2x = 6^(3/x). Hmm, but that might complicate things.Alternatively, taking both sides to the power of 1/x:2x = 216^(1/x)But 216 is 6^3, so 216^(1/x) = 6^(3/x). So, 2x = 6^(3/x).Hmm, so 2x = 6^(3/x). Let me take natural logs again:ln(2x) = (3/x) * ln(6)So, ln(2x) = (3 ln6)/xMultiply both sides by x:x ln(2x) = 3 ln6Wait, that's the same equation as before, leading to x=3. So, same result.Alternatively, maybe trying to express 2x as 6. So, if 2x=6, then x=3, which works. So, that's straightforward.Alternatively, maybe trying to see if x is a rational number or irrational. Since x=3 is an integer, it's rational, so options B and C can be eliminated. Then, between A, D, E. Since 3 is not a perfect square or cube, so A is correct.Therefore, I think the answer is A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"The grandfather is three times older than the older grandson and four times older than the younger grandson. Together, both grandsons are 49 years old. How old is the grandfather?","answer":"First, I'll define the variables. Let ( G ) represent the grandfather's age, ( O ) the older grandson's age, and ( Y ) the younger grandson's age.According to the problem, the grandfather is three times older than the older grandson, so I can write the equation:[ G = 3O ]Similarly, the grandfather is four times older than the younger grandson, which gives:[ G = 4Y ]The problem also states that together, both grandsons are 49 years old:[ O + Y = 49 ]Since both expressions for ( G ) are equal to ( G ), I can set them equal to each other:[ 3O = 4Y ]Now, I'll solve for one variable in terms of the other.

The given number starts with the digit 4. What digit does it end with?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a 2022-digit natural number. The rule is that any two consecutive digits form a two-digit number that's divisible by either 19 or 23. The number starts with 4, and I need to figure out what digit it ends with. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's understand the constraints. The number is 2022 digits long, which is a lot! But the key is that every pair of consecutive digits must form a two-digit number divisible by 19 or 23. So, for example, if the number starts with 4, the next digit has to be such that 4 followed by that digit is divisible by 19 or 23.Let me list out all two-digit numbers divisible by 19 or 23. Maybe that will help me see a pattern or figure out possible transitions between digits.Starting with 19: The two-digit multiples are 19, 38, 57, 76, and 95.For 23: The two-digit multiples are 23, 46, 69, and 92.So, the possible two-digit numbers we can have are: 19, 23, 38, 46, 57, 69, 76, 92, 95.Now, each of these two-digit numbers can be thought of as transitions from the first digit to the second digit. So, for example, 19 is a transition from 1 to 9, 23 is a transition from 2 to 3, and so on.Given that the number starts with 4, the first transition must be from 4 to some digit such that 4 followed by that digit is in our list. Looking at our list, the two-digit numbers starting with 4 are 46. So, the next digit after 4 must be 6.So, the number starts with 4, then 6. Now, let's see what comes after 6. We need a two-digit number starting with 6 that's in our list. Looking at our list, 69 is the only one starting with 6. So, the next digit after 6 must be 9.Now, we're at 9. Let's see what comes after 9. The two-digit numbers starting with 9 in our list are 92 and 95. So, the next digit can be either 2 or 5. Hmm, so now we have a choice. Let's explore both possibilities.First, if after 9 we go to 2, then the next digit is 2. Then, looking at two-digit numbers starting with 2, we have 23. So, after 2, we must go to 3.Now, at 3, the next digit must form a two-digit number starting with 3. Looking at our list, 38 is the only one. So, next is 8.At 8, the next digit must form a two-digit number starting with 8. Looking at our list, 8 isn't the starting digit of any two-digit number in our list. Wait, that's a problem. So, if we go from 3 to 8, then 8 can't transition anywhere because none of the two-digit numbers in our list start with 8. That means this path leads to a dead end. So, going from 9 to 2 leads us to a dead end after a few steps. So, maybe that's not the right path.Let's backtrack. Instead of going from 9 to 2, let's try going from 9 to 5. So, after 9, we have 5. Now, looking at two-digit numbers starting with 5, we have 57. So, next digit is 7.At 7, the next digit must form a two-digit number starting with 7. Looking at our list, 76 is the only one. So, next is 6.Now, at 6, we've been here before. From 6, we go to 9. So, the sequence is 4,6,9,5,7,6,9,5,7,6,9,5,7,... and so on.Wait, so after 7, we go back to 6, then 9, then 5, then 7, and this seems to form a cycle: 6,9,5,7,6,9,5,7,...So, the cycle is 6,9,5,7, and then repeats. Each cycle is 4 digits long: 6,9,5,7.So, starting from 4, the sequence is 4,6,9,5,7,6,9,5,7,6,9,5,7,... and so on.Now, the total number of digits is 2022. The first digit is 4, then starting from the second digit, we have the cycle of 4 digits: 6,9,5,7.So, let's see how many digits are in the cycle part. The first digit is 4, then from the second digit onwards, it's 2021 digits. So, 2021 digits divided by the cycle length of 4. Let's calculate 2021 divided by 4.2021 ÷ 4 is 505 with a remainder of 1. Because 505×4=2020, so 2021-2020=1.So, the cycle repeats 505 times, which accounts for 505×4=2020 digits, and then there's 1 more digit after that.So, starting from the second digit, the first 2020 digits are 505 cycles of 6,9,5,7. Then, the 2021st digit is the first digit of the cycle, which is 6.Therefore, the entire number is 4 followed by 505 cycles of 6,9,5,7 and then a 6.So, the last digit is the 2022nd digit. Let's see: the first digit is 4, then digits 2 to 2022 are the 2021 digits we just discussed. So, the last digit is the 2022nd digit, which is the last digit of the 2021 digits. Since 2021 digits consist of 505 cycles (2020 digits) plus 1 more digit, the last digit is the first digit of the cycle, which is 6.Wait, but let me double-check that. The first digit is 4. Then, digits 2 to 2022 are 2021 digits. These 2021 digits consist of 505 full cycles (each 4 digits) and 1 extra digit. So, the last digit is the first digit of the cycle, which is 6.Therefore, the number ends with 6.But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the cycle. Let me write out the sequence:Start: 4Then, 6 (digit 2)Then, 9 (digit 3)Then, 5 (digit 4)Then, 7 (digit 5)Then, 6 (digit 6)Then, 9 (digit 7)Then, 5 (digit 8)Then, 7 (digit 9)And so on.So, the cycle is 6,9,5,7, which is 4 digits. So, starting from digit 2, every 4 digits repeat.So, digit 2:6, digit3:9, digit4:5, digit5:7, digit6:6, digit7:9, digit8:5, digit9:7,...So, the position of each digit in the cycle can be determined by (n-2) mod 4, where n is the digit position.So, for digit 2022, which is the last digit, n=2022.Compute (2022 - 2) mod 4 = 2020 mod 4 = 0.So, 0 corresponds to the 4th digit in the cycle, which is 7.Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. Hmm, maybe I messed up the indexing.Wait, let's clarify. The cycle is 6,9,5,7. So, positions:Cycle position 1:6Cycle position 2:9Cycle position 3:5Cycle position 4:7So, if (n-2) mod 4 = 0, that would correspond to cycle position 4, which is 7.But earlier, I thought that 2021 digits consist of 505 cycles (2020 digits) plus 1 digit, so the last digit is the first digit of the cycle, which is 6.But according to the modulo calculation, it's 7.Hmm, which is correct?Wait, let's think about it. The number of digits after the first digit is 2021. So, 2021 divided by 4 is 505 with a remainder of 1. So, 505 full cycles (each 4 digits) account for 2020 digits, and then 1 more digit. So, the 2021st digit is the first digit of the cycle, which is 6.But wait, digit 2 is the first digit of the cycle, which is 6. So, digit 2:6, digit3:9, digit4:5, digit5:7, digit6:6, etc.So, digit 2: cycle position 1digit3: cycle position 2digit4: cycle position 3digit5: cycle position 4digit6: cycle position 1So, for digit n, where n >=2, the cycle position is (n-2) mod 4 +1.So, for digit 2022, n=2022.Compute (2022 -2) mod 4 +1 = 2020 mod 4 +1 = 0 +1=1.So, cycle position 1, which is 6.Therefore, the last digit is 6.Wait, but earlier, when I thought about the 2021 digits, I considered that 2021 = 505*4 +1, so the last digit is the first digit of the cycle, which is 6.But when I did the modulo calculation, I got cycle position 1, which is 6.So, both methods agree that the last digit is 6.Wait, but earlier I thought that (n-2) mod 4 =0 would correspond to cycle position 4, but actually, it's (n-2) mod 4 +1.So, for n=2022, (2022-2)=2020, 2020 mod4=0, so 0+1=1, which is cycle position1:6.Therefore, the last digit is 6.But let me check with a smaller number to make sure.Suppose the number is 4 digits: 4,6,9,5.Wait, no, starting from 4, the next digit is 6, then 9, then 5, then 7, then 6, etc.Wait, for a 5-digit number: 4,6,9,5,7.So, digit5 is 7.Using the formula: n=5.(5-2)=3, 3 mod4=3, 3+1=4, cycle position4:7. Correct.Another test: n=6.(6-2)=4, 4 mod4=0, 0+1=1, cycle position1:6. Correct, digit6 is6.n=7: (7-2)=5, 5 mod4=1, 1+1=2, cycle position2:9. Correct, digit7 is9.n=8: (8-2)=6, 6 mod4=2, 2+1=3, cycle position3:5. Correct, digit8 is5.n=9: (9-2)=7,7 mod4=3,3+1=4, cycle position4:7. Correct, digit9 is7.n=10: (10-2)=8,8 mod4=0,0+1=1, cycle position1:6. Correct, digit10 is6.So, the formula works.Therefore, for n=2022, (2022-2)=2020, 2020 mod4=0, 0+1=1, cycle position1:6.Therefore, the last digit is6.Wait, but earlier I thought that after 505 cycles (2020 digits), the next digit is6, which is the 2021st digit, and then the 2022nd digit would be the next one, which is9? Wait, no, because the 2021st digit is6, which is the first digit of the cycle, then the 2022nd digit would be the second digit of the cycle, which is9.Wait, hold on, I'm getting confused.Wait, the total number of digits after the first digit is2021.These 2021 digits consist of505 full cycles (each4 digits) and1 extra digit.Each cycle is6,9,5,7.So, 505 cycles account for505×4=2020 digits.Then, the 2021st digit is the first digit of the next cycle, which is6.Therefore, the digits are:1:42:63:94:55:76:67:98:59:7...2021:62022:9Wait, so the 2022nd digit is the next digit after the 2021st digit, which is6. So, after6, the next digit is9.Therefore, the last digit is9.Wait, now I'm confused because two different methods are giving me different answers.Let me clarify:- The first digit is4.- From digit2 to digit2022, there are2021 digits.- These2021 digits consist of505 full cycles (each4 digits) and1 extra digit.- Each cycle is6,9,5,7.- So, 505 cycles account for2020 digits, so digit2021 is the first digit of the next cycle, which is6.- Therefore, digit2021 is6.- Then, digit2022 would be the next digit after6, which is9.Therefore, the last digit is9.But earlier, using the formula, I thought it was6.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.Wait, the formula was: for digit n, cycle position is(n-2) mod4 +1.So, for n=2022, (2022-2)=2020, 2020 mod4=0, 0+1=1. So, cycle position1:6.But according to the cycle, digit2022 is the next digit after digit2021, which is6, so it should be9.Wait, this is conflicting.Wait, perhaps the formula is wrong.Wait, let's think about it again.The cycle is6,9,5,7.Each cycle is4 digits.Starting from digit2:6 (cycle position1)digit3:9 (cycle position2)digit4:5 (cycle position3)digit5:7 (cycle position4)digit6:6 (cycle position1)digit7:9 (cycle position2)and so on.So, for digit n, where n>=2, the cycle position is (n-2) mod4 +1.So, for n=2022, (2022-2)=2020, 2020 mod4=0, 0+1=1. So, cycle position1:6.But according to the sequence, digit2022 should be the next digit after digit2021, which is6, so it should be9.Wait, this seems contradictory.Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the way I'm interpreting the cycle is wrong.Wait, if the cycle is6,9,5,7, then the cycle positions are:1:62:93:54:7So, if (n-2) mod4 +1=1, that corresponds to6.But in the sequence, digit2022 is the next digit after digit2021, which is6, so it should be9.Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the way I'm counting the digits is wrong.Wait, digit2022 is the last digit, which is the 2022nd digit.But the first digit is4, then digits2-2022 are2021 digits.So, digit2022 is the last digit of the2021 digits.Wait, but2021 digits consist of505 cycles (2020 digits) and1 extra digit.So, the last digit is the extra digit, which is the first digit of the cycle, which is6.Wait, but that would mean digit2022 is6.But according to the sequence, after digit2021 (which is6), the next digit should be9.Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions.Wait, let's think of it as:- The first digit is4.- Then, starting from digit2, we have2021 digits.- These2021 digits are composed of505 full cycles (each4 digits) and1 extra digit.- Each cycle is6,9,5,7.- So, the first2020 digits (digits2-2021) are505 cycles of6,9,5,7.- Then, the2021st digit (digit2022) is the first digit of the next cycle, which is6.Wait, no, because digit2022 is the last digit, which is the2022nd digit.Wait, perhaps the confusion is in how we count the digits.Wait, digit1:4digits2-2022:2021 digits.These2021 digits consist of505 cycles (2020 digits) and1 extra digit.So, digit2022 is the extra digit, which is the first digit of the cycle, which is6.Therefore, the last digit is6.But according to the sequence, after digit2021 (which is the last digit of the505th cycle, which is7), the next digit would be6.Wait, no, if the505 cycles end at digit2021, then digit2022 would be the next digit, which is6.Wait, this is getting really confusing.Let me try to write out the positions:- digit1:4- digit2:6 (cycle1, position1)- digit3:9 (cycle1, position2)- digit4:5 (cycle1, position3)- digit5:7 (cycle1, position4)- digit6:6 (cycle2, position1)- digit7:9 (cycle2, position2)- digit8:5 (cycle2, position3)- digit9:7 (cycle2, position4)...So, each cycle starts at digit2,6,10,... etc.So, the first cycle (cycle1) is digits2-5:6,9,5,7Second cycle (cycle2) is digits6-9:6,9,5,7...So, the nth cycle starts at digit2 +4*(n-1).So, the505th cycle starts at digit2 +4*(505-1)=2+4*504=2+2016=2018.So, cycle505 is digits2018-2021:6,9,5,7.Then, the next digit after cycle505 is digit2022, which would be the first digit of cycle506, which is6.Therefore, digit2022 is6.So, the last digit is6.Wait, that makes sense.So, the first cycle is digits2-5, the second cycle is6-9, ..., the505th cycle is2018-2021, and then digit2022 is the first digit of the next cycle, which is6.Therefore, the last digit is6.But earlier, when I thought that after digit2021 (which is7), the next digit would be6, that's correct because digit2022 is6.Wait, so digit2021 is7, and digit2022 is6.Wait, no, because the505th cycle ends at digit2021, which is7, and then digit2022 is the next digit, which is6.Therefore, the last digit is6.Yes, that makes sense.So, the answer is6.But let me double-check with a smaller number.Suppose the number has5 digits:4,6,9,5,7.So, digit5 is7.Using the formula: n=5.(5-2)=3, 3 mod4=3, 3+1=4, cycle position4:7. Correct.Another example: n=6.(6-2)=4,4 mod4=0,0+1=1, cycle position1:6. Correct, digit6 is6.n=7: (7-2)=5,5 mod4=1,1+1=2, cycle position2:9. Correct, digit7 is9.n=8: (8-2)=6,6 mod4=2,2+1=3, cycle position3:5. Correct, digit8 is5.n=9: (9-2)=7,7 mod4=3,3+1=4, cycle position4:7. Correct, digit9 is7.n=10: (10-2)=8,8 mod4=0,0+1=1, cycle position1:6. Correct, digit10 is6.So, the formula works.Therefore, for n=2022, (2022-2)=2020,2020 mod4=0,0+1=1, cycle position1:6.Therefore, the last digit is6.So, the answer is6.**Final Answer**The number ends with the digit boxed{6}."},{"question":"A certain commodity has a cost price of 10 yuan per unit. If it is sold at a price of 20 yuan per unit, then 360 units can be sold per month. If it is sold at a price of 30 yuan per unit, then 60 units can be sold per month. Assume that the monthly sales quantity y is a linear function of the selling price x (in yuan).<br/>(1) Find the analytical expression of y in terms of x;<br/>(2) At what price should the product be sold to maximize the monthly profit? Calculate this maximum profit.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a commodity with a cost price of 10 yuan per unit. The selling price affects how many units can be sold each month. At 20 yuan, they sell 360 units, and at 30 yuan, they only sell 60 units. I need to figure out two things: first, the linear relationship between the selling price x and the monthly sales quantity y. Second, I need to determine the price that will maximize the monthly profit and calculate that maximum profit.Starting with part (1), finding the analytical expression of y in terms of x. Since it's given that y is a linear function of x, that means it has the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. To find m and b, I can use the two given points: when x is 20, y is 360, and when x is 30, y is 60.So, let's write down these two equations:1. When x = 20, y = 360: 360 = m*20 + b2. When x = 30, y = 60: 60 = m*30 + bNow, I can solve these two equations simultaneously to find m and b. Let's subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate b:360 - 60 = (m*20 + b) - (m*30 + b)300 = -10mSo, m = 300 / (-10) = -30.Wait, that seems a bit steep. Let me check my subtraction:360 - 60 is 300, and (20m + b) - (30m + b) is -10m. So yes, 300 = -10m, so m = -30. Hmm, okay, so the slope is -30. That means for every 1 yuan increase in price, sales decrease by 30 units. That seems plausible given the data points.Now, let's plug m back into one of the equations to find b. Let's use the first equation:360 = (-30)*20 + b360 = -600 + bSo, b = 360 + 600 = 960.So, the equation is y = -30x + 960.Let me verify this with the second point to make sure:y = -30*30 + 960 = -900 + 960 = 60. Perfect, that matches the given data. So, part (1) is done. The analytical expression is y = -30x + 960.Moving on to part (2): finding the price that maximizes monthly profit and calculating that profit.First, let's recall that profit is calculated as (Selling Price - Cost Price) * Number of Units Sold.Given that the cost price is 10 yuan per unit, the profit per unit is (x - 10) yuan. The number of units sold is y, which we now know is -30x + 960.Therefore, the profit function P(x) can be written as:P(x) = (x - 10) * y = (x - 10)*(-30x + 960).Let me expand this expression:P(x) = (x - 10)*(-30x + 960)= x*(-30x + 960) - 10*(-30x + 960)= -30x² + 960x + 300x - 9600= -30x² + 1260x - 9600.So, the profit function is a quadratic function in terms of x, and since the coefficient of x² is negative (-30), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.To find the maximum profit, we need to find the vertex of this parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a).In our case, a = -30 and b = 1260.So, x = -1260 / (2*(-30)) = -1260 / (-60) = 21.So, the selling price that maximizes profit is 21 yuan per unit.Now, let's calculate the maximum profit by plugging x = 21 back into the profit function.First, let's compute y when x = 21:y = -30*21 + 960 = -630 + 960 = 330 units.Then, the profit is:P(21) = (21 - 10)*330 = 11*330 = 3630 yuan.Alternatively, plugging x = 21 into the quadratic profit function:P(21) = -30*(21)^2 + 1260*21 - 9600.Let me compute each term:21 squared is 441.So, -30*441 = -13230.1260*21: Let's compute 1260*20 = 25200, plus 1260*1 = 1260, so total is 25200 + 1260 = 26460.So, P(21) = -13230 + 26460 - 9600.Compute step by step:-13230 + 26460 = 13230.13230 - 9600 = 3630.Same result, so that's consistent.Therefore, the maximum profit is 3630 yuan when the selling price is set at 21 yuan per unit.Wait, let me just double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with quadratics, it's easy to make a mistake.Alternatively, since the profit function is P(x) = -30x² + 1260x - 9600, the vertex is at x = 21, which we found.Alternatively, we can also use calculus to find the maximum. Taking the derivative of P(x):P'(x) = dP/dx = -60x + 1260.Setting P'(x) = 0:-60x + 1260 = 0-60x = -1260x = (-1260)/(-60) = 21.So, same result. Therefore, x = 21 is indeed the price that maximizes profit.Just to make sure, let's check the profit at x = 20 and x = 30 to see if 21 gives a higher profit.At x = 20:y = -30*20 + 960 = -600 + 960 = 360.Profit = (20 - 10)*360 = 10*360 = 3600 yuan.At x = 30:y = -30*30 + 960 = -900 + 960 = 60.Profit = (30 - 10)*60 = 20*60 = 1200 yuan.So, 3600 at x=20, 3630 at x=21, and 1200 at x=30. So, yes, 21 gives a higher profit than 20, which is just 30 more. So, that seems correct.Alternatively, let's check x=22:y = -30*22 + 960 = -660 + 960 = 300.Profit = (22 - 10)*300 = 12*300 = 3600 yuan.So, at x=22, the profit is back to 3600, which is less than 3630 at x=21. So, that makes sense because the parabola peaks at x=21.Therefore, I feel confident that the maximum profit occurs at x=21 yuan, with a profit of 3630 yuan.**Final Answer**(1) The analytical expression is boxed{y = -30x + 960}.(2) The product should be sold at boxed{21} yuan per unit to maximize the monthly profit, and the maximum profit is boxed{3630} yuan."},{"question":"Given the imaginary unit i, and complex numbers z_{1}=3+yi(yinmathbb{R}), z_{2}=2-i, and frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}=1+i, find the value of y.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here with complex numbers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:Given the imaginary unit ( i ), and complex numbers ( z_{1} = 3 + yi ) where ( y ) is a real number, ( z_{2} = 2 - i ), and ( frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}} = 1 + i ). We need to find the value of ( y ).Hmm, okay. So, complex numbers. I remember that to divide complex numbers, you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. That should help simplify things. Let me write down what I know.First, ( z_{1} = 3 + yi ) and ( z_{2} = 2 - i ). The ratio ( frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}} ) is given as ( 1 + i ). So, if I set up the equation:( frac{3 + yi}{2 - i} = 1 + i )I need to solve for ( y ). To do this, I can multiply both sides by ( 2 - i ) to get rid of the denominator. Let me write that out:( 3 + yi = (1 + i)(2 - i) )Okay, now I need to multiply out the right-hand side. Let me compute that.First, multiply ( 1 ) by ( 2 ): that's 2.Then, ( 1 ) times ( -i ): that's ( -i ).Next, ( i ) times ( 2 ): that's ( 2i ).And finally, ( i ) times ( -i ): that's ( -i^2 ).So, putting it all together:( 2 - i + 2i - i^2 )Combine like terms. The ( -i + 2i ) gives ( i ). Then, ( -i^2 ) is ( -(-1) ) because ( i^2 = -1 ). So, that becomes ( +1 ). So, adding that to 2:( 2 + 1 + i = 3 + i )So, the right-hand side simplifies to ( 3 + i ). Therefore, our equation is:( 3 + yi = 3 + i )Hmm, okay. So, if I subtract 3 from both sides, I get:( yi = i )So, that simplifies to ( yi = i ). To solve for ( y ), I can divide both sides by ( i ), but wait, dividing by ( i ) can be a bit tricky. Alternatively, since ( i ) is not zero, I can just equate the coefficients.Looking at the equation ( yi = i ), the coefficients of ( i ) must be equal. So, ( y = 1 ).Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the beginning:( frac{3 + yi}{2 - i} = 1 + i )Multiply both sides by ( 2 - i ):( 3 + yi = (1 + i)(2 - i) )Multiplying out:( (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (i)(2) + (i)(-i) = 2 - i + 2i - i^2 )Simplify:( 2 + i - (-1) = 2 + i + 1 = 3 + i )So, ( 3 + yi = 3 + i ). Subtract 3:( yi = i )Divide both sides by ( i ):( y = 1 )Wait, is that all? It seems too simple, but maybe that's just how it is.Alternatively, maybe I should approach it by expressing ( z_{1} ) in terms of ( z_{2} ) and ( 1 + i ). Let me try another method to confirm.Given ( frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}} = 1 + i ), so ( z_{1} = z_{2}(1 + i) ). Since ( z_{2} = 2 - i ), then:( z_{1} = (2 - i)(1 + i) )Which is the same multiplication as before. So, computing that:( 2(1) + 2(i) - i(1) - i(i) = 2 + 2i - i - i^2 )Simplify:( 2 + i - (-1) = 2 + i + 1 = 3 + i )So, ( z_{1} = 3 + i ). But ( z_{1} ) is given as ( 3 + yi ). Therefore, ( 3 + yi = 3 + i ), which again gives ( yi = i ), so ( y = 1 ).Hmm, same result. So, seems like ( y = 1 ) is the correct answer.Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can plug it back into the original equation and see if it works.Let me compute ( frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}} ) with ( y = 1 ). So, ( z_{1} = 3 + 1i = 3 + i ), and ( z_{2} = 2 - i ).So, ( frac{3 + i}{2 - i} ). Let's compute this.Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is ( 2 + i ):( frac{(3 + i)(2 + i)}{(2 - i)(2 + i)} )Compute the denominator first:( (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5 )Now, the numerator:( (3)(2) + (3)(i) + (i)(2) + (i)(i) = 6 + 3i + 2i + i^2 )Simplify:( 6 + 5i + (-1) = 5 + 5i )So, putting it together:( frac{5 + 5i}{5} = 1 + i )Which is exactly what was given. So, yes, that checks out. Therefore, ( y = 1 ) is indeed the correct answer.I think I've got it. It was a bit of a straightforward problem once I remembered how to multiply complex numbers and equate the real and imaginary parts. Initially, I thought it might be more complicated, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable.Just to recap:1. Start with the given equation ( frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}} = 1 + i ).2. Multiply both sides by ( z_{2} ) to isolate ( z_{1} ).3. Expand the multiplication on the right-hand side.4. Simplify the expression, remembering that ( i^2 = -1 ).5. Compare the resulting complex number with the given form of ( z_{1} ) to solve for ( y ).6. Verify the solution by plugging it back into the original equation.This systematic approach helped me avoid mistakes and ensured that I arrived at the correct answer. It's always good to double-check, especially when dealing with complex numbers because it's easy to mix up signs or forget about the ( i^2 = -1 ) part.So, in conclusion, after carefully working through the problem and verifying each step, I'm confident that ( y = 1 ) is the right solution.**Final Answer**The value of ( y ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"How many pairs of parallel edges, such as overline{AB} and overline{GH} or overline{EH} and overline{FG}, does a cube have?text{(A) }6 quadtext{(B) }12 quadtext{(C) } 18 quadtext{(D) } 24 quad text{(E) } 36","answer":"First, I need to understand the structure of a cube.

For example, along the x-axis, the edges AB, CD, EF, and GH are all parallel.Since there are 3 different directions (x, y, z), and each direction has 4 parallel edges, I can calculate the number of unique pairs of parallel edges for each direction. The number of ways to choose 2 edges out of 4 is given by the combination formula C(4,2), which equals 6.Finally, multiplying the number of pairs per direction by the number of directions gives the total number of parallel edge pairs: 6 pairs per direction × 3 directions = 18 pairs."},{"question":"Barry stands on his head for 10 minutes at a time, but then he must sit for 5 minutes before he can take another turn standing on his head.

Which of the following statements is true?(A) ( p < q < r )(B) ( p < r < q )(C) ( q < p < r )(D) ( r < p < q )(E) ( q < r < p )","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare three numbers: ( p = 2^{3009} ), ( q = 3^{2006} ), and ( r = 5^{1003} ). The question is asking which of the given statements about their order is true. The options are:(A) ( p < q < r )(B) ( p < r < q )(C) ( q < p < r )(D) ( r < p < q )(E) ( q < r < p )Hmm, so I need to figure out the relationship between these three numbers. They are all exponentials with different bases and exponents, so comparing them directly isn't straightforward. I remember that one way to compare exponentials is by taking logarithms because logarithms can help simplify the comparison by converting exponents into multipliers.Let me recall that ( log(a^b) = b cdot log(a) ). So, if I take the logarithm of each number, I can compare their logarithms instead, which might be easier.Let me denote:( log p = log(2^{3009}) = 3009 cdot log(2) )( log q = log(3^{2006}) = 2006 cdot log(3) )( log r = log(5^{1003}) = 1003 cdot log(5) )Now, I can compute these logarithms and compare them. But I need approximate values for ( log(2) ), ( log(3) ), and ( log(5) ). I remember that:( log(2) approx 0.3010 )( log(3) approx 0.4771 )( log(5) approx 0.6990 )These are common logarithms, base 10, right? So, let me compute each:First, ( log p = 3009 times 0.3010 )Let me compute that:3009 * 0.3010Hmm, 3000 * 0.3010 = 903.09 * 0.3010 = 2.709So, total is 903.0 + 2.709 = 905.709So, ( log p approx 905.709 )Next, ( log q = 2006 times 0.4771 )Let me compute that:2000 * 0.4771 = 954.26 * 0.4771 = 2.8626So, total is 954.2 + 2.8626 = 957.0626So, ( log q approx 957.0626 )Lastly, ( log r = 1003 times 0.6990 )Compute that:1000 * 0.6990 = 699.03 * 0.6990 = 2.097Total is 699.0 + 2.097 = 701.097So, ( log r approx 701.097 )Now, let's list the approximate logarithms:- ( log p approx 905.709 )- ( log q approx 957.0626 )- ( log r approx 701.097 )So, comparing these:( log r approx 701.097 ) is the smallest,then ( log p approx 905.709 ),and ( log q approx 957.0626 ) is the largest.Since logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, the order of the original numbers will be the same as the order of their logarithms.Therefore, ( r < p < q )Looking back at the options, that's option (D): ( r < p < q )Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes approximations can be misleading.Let me verify the multiplication steps again.Starting with ( log p = 3009 times 0.3010 )3009 * 0.3010:Break it down as (3000 + 9) * 0.30103000 * 0.3010 = 903.09 * 0.3010 = 2.709Total: 903.0 + 2.709 = 905.709. That seems correct.Next, ( log q = 2006 times 0.4771 )2006 * 0.4771:Break it down as (2000 + 6) * 0.47712000 * 0.4771 = 954.26 * 0.4771 = 2.8626Total: 954.2 + 2.8626 = 957.0626. That also seems correct.Lastly, ( log r = 1003 times 0.6990 )1003 * 0.6990:Break it down as (1000 + 3) * 0.69901000 * 0.6990 = 699.03 * 0.6990 = 2.097Total: 699.0 + 2.097 = 701.097. Correct.So, the logarithms are indeed approximately 701.097, 905.709, and 957.0626 for r, p, q respectively.Therefore, the order is ( r < p < q ), which is option (D).But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the logarithm values.Wait, no, the logarithm values I used are standard base 10 logarithms, right? So, 0.3010 for log2, 0.4771 for log3, and 0.6990 for log5. Those are correct.Alternatively, maybe I should use natural logarithms? But no, because the base doesn't matter as long as I'm consistent. Since all the logarithms are base 10, the comparison remains the same.Alternatively, maybe I can compare the exponents in a different way. For example, express all exponents with the same base or something.But I think taking logarithms is the correct approach here.Alternatively, maybe express each number as a power with the same exponent? Let's see.Wait, p is 2^3009, q is 3^2006, r is 5^1003.Notice that 3009 is 3*1003, 2006 is 2*1003, and 1003 is 1003.So, p = (2^3)^1003 = 8^1003q = (3^2)^1003 = 9^1003r = 5^1003So, all three numbers can be expressed as something raised to the 1003rd power.Therefore, p = 8^1003, q = 9^1003, r = 5^1003.Therefore, since 5 < 8 < 9, then 5^1003 < 8^1003 < 9^1003, so r < p < q.That's the same conclusion as before.So, that's another way to see it, which confirms that option (D) is correct.Therefore, I think I can confidently say that the correct answer is (D).**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Given the parametric equation of line l as begin{cases} x=1+t  y= sqrt {3}+ sqrt {3}t end{cases} (where t is the parameter).

Let me try to tackle them step by step.Starting with part (Ⅰ): I need to find the standard equation of line ( l ) and the Cartesian coordinate equation of curve ( C ).First, the parametric equations for line ( l ) are given as:[begin{cases}x = 1 + t y = sqrt{3} + sqrt{3}tend{cases}]where ( t ) is the parameter.I remember that to convert parametric equations to a standard Cartesian equation, I can eliminate the parameter ( t ). Let me solve for ( t ) from the first equation and substitute it into the second.From the first equation:[x = 1 + t implies t = x - 1]Now plug this into the second equation:[y = sqrt{3} + sqrt{3}t = sqrt{3} + sqrt{3}(x - 1)]Let me simplify that:[y = sqrt{3} + sqrt{3}x - sqrt{3} = sqrt{3}x]Wait, that simplifies nicely. So the standard equation of line ( l ) is ( y = sqrt{3}x ). That seems straightforward.Now, moving on to curve ( C ). Its polar equation is given as:[rho^2 - 4rho costheta - 2sqrt{3}rho sintheta + 4 = 0]I need to convert this into a Cartesian equation. I recall that in polar coordinates, ( rho^2 = x^2 + y^2 ), ( rho costheta = x ), and ( rho sintheta = y ). Let me substitute these into the equation.Substituting:[(x^2 + y^2) - 4x - 2sqrt{3}y + 4 = 0]So, the Cartesian equation is:[x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 2sqrt{3}y + 4 = 0]Hmm, maybe I can write this in a more standard form by completing the squares for both ( x ) and ( y ).Let me rearrange the equation:[x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 2sqrt{3}y = -4]Now, completing the square for ( x ):Take the coefficient of ( x ), which is -4, divide by 2 to get -2, square it to get 4. Similarly for ( y ):Coefficient of ( y ) is -2√3, divide by 2 to get -√3, square it to get 3.So, add these squares to both sides:[(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 2sqrt{3}y + 3) = -4 + 4 + 3]Simplify:[(x - 2)^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3]So, the Cartesian equation of curve ( C ) is a circle with center at ( (2, sqrt{3}) ) and radius ( sqrt{3} ). That makes sense.Alright, so part (Ⅰ) is done. The standard equation of line ( l ) is ( y = sqrt{3}x ), and the Cartesian equation of curve ( C ) is ( (x - 2)^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3 ).Moving on to part (Ⅱ): I need to find the product of the distances from the origin ( O ) to points ( A ) and ( B ), where line ( l ) intersects curve ( C ). In other words, compute ( |OA| cdot |OB| ).I remember that when a line intersects a circle, the product of the distances from the origin to the intersection points can be found using the power of a point. The power of point ( O ) with respect to circle ( C ) is equal to ( |OA| cdot |OB| ).The formula for the power of a point ( (x_0, y_0) ) with respect to a circle with center ( (h, k) ) and radius ( r ) is:[text{Power} = (x_0 - h)^2 + (y_0 - k)^2 - r^2]In this case, the origin ( O ) is ( (0, 0) ), the center of the circle is ( (2, sqrt{3}) ), and the radius is ( sqrt{3} ).Plugging into the formula:[text{Power} = (0 - 2)^2 + (0 - sqrt{3})^2 - (sqrt{3})^2]Calculating each term:- ( (0 - 2)^2 = 4 )- ( (0 - sqrt{3})^2 = 3 )- ( (sqrt{3})^2 = 3 )So,[text{Power} = 4 + 3 - 3 = 4]Therefore, ( |OA| cdot |OB| = 4 ).Wait, let me double-check if this is correct. Alternatively, I could solve the system of equations to find points ( A ) and ( B ), compute their distances from the origin, and then multiply them. Maybe that will confirm the result.So, the line ( l ) is ( y = sqrt{3}x ), and the circle ( C ) is ( (x - 2)^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3 ).Substitute ( y = sqrt{3}x ) into the circle equation:[(x - 2)^2 + (sqrt{3}x - sqrt{3})^2 = 3]Let me expand each term.First term:[(x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4]Second term:[(sqrt{3}x - sqrt{3})^2 = (sqrt{3}(x - 1))^2 = 3(x - 1)^2 = 3(x^2 - 2x + 1)]So, expanding:[3x^2 - 6x + 3]Now, combine both terms:[(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (3x^2 - 6x + 3) = 3]Combine like terms:[x^2 + 3x^2 = 4x^2][-4x -6x = -10x][4 + 3 = 7]So, the equation becomes:[4x^2 - 10x + 7 = 3]Subtract 3 from both sides:[4x^2 - 10x + 4 = 0]Simplify by dividing all terms by 2:[2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0]Now, solve this quadratic equation for ( x ). Let's use the quadratic formula:[x = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 - 16}}{4} = frac{5 pm 3}{4}]So, the solutions are:- ( x = frac{5 + 3}{4} = 2 )- ( x = frac{5 - 3}{4} = frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2} )Now, find the corresponding ( y ) values using ( y = sqrt{3}x ):- For ( x = 2 ): ( y = 2sqrt{3} )- For ( x = frac{1}{2} ): ( y = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} )Thus, points ( A ) and ( B ) are ( (2, 2sqrt{3}) ) and ( left( frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) ).Now, compute the distances ( |OA| ) and ( |OB| ).Distance ( |OA| ):[|OA| = sqrt{(2)^2 + (2sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{4 + 12} = sqrt{16} = 4]Distance ( |OB| ):[|OB| = sqrt{left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2} = sqrt{frac{1}{4} + frac{3}{4}} = sqrt{1} = 1]Therefore, the product ( |OA| cdot |OB| = 4 times 1 = 4 ).Hmm, that's the same result as before. So, both methods give me 4. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.Alternatively, I remember that in parametric terms, the product ( |OA| cdot |OB| ) can also be found using the concept of power of a point, which is essentially what I did first. So, that's consistent.Just to recap, the power of point ( O ) with respect to circle ( C ) is equal to ( |OA| cdot |OB| ), which we calculated as 4. Solving the system of equations also gave me the same result. So, I think 4 is the correct answer.I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think I'm good.**Final Answer**Ⅰ.

Let me write them out in terms of 3:- The first term is (3^{frac{1}{3}}).- The second term is 9, which is (3^2), raised to the power of (frac{1}{3}), so that's ( (3^2)^{frac{1}{3}} = 3^{frac{2}{3}} ).- The third term is 27, which is (3^3), raised to the power of (frac{1}{27}), so that's ( (3^3)^{frac{1}{27}} = 3^{frac{3}{27}} = 3^{frac{1}{9}} ).  Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. The third term is 27 raised to the 1/27 power, which is (3^{3 times frac{1}{27}} = 3^{frac{1}{9}}). Yeah, that's correct.So, if I continue this pattern, each term is (3) raised to some exponent. Let me see if I can find a general term for the nth term.Looking at the exponents:- First term exponent: ( frac{1}{3} )- Second term exponent: ( frac{2}{3} )- Third term exponent: ( frac{1}{9} )  Wait, that doesn't seem to follow a straightforward pattern. Maybe I should look at the exponents more carefully.Wait, actually, let's see:First term: (3^{frac{1}{3}})Second term: (9^{frac{1}{3}} = (3^2)^{frac{1}{3}} = 3^{frac{2}{3}})Third term: (27^{frac{1}{27}} = (3^3)^{frac{1}{27}} = 3^{frac{3}{27}} = 3^{frac{1}{9}})Fourth term: Next term would be (81^{frac{1}{81}} = (3^4)^{frac{1}{81}} = 3^{frac{4}{81}}), right?So, the exponents are: ( frac{1}{3}, frac{2}{3}, frac{1}{9}, frac{4}{81}, ldots )Hmm, that seems a bit irregular. Maybe I can express each exponent as ( frac{n}{3^n} ) where n is the term number?Wait, let's check:For the first term, n=1: ( frac{1}{3^1} = frac{1}{3} ). Correct.Second term, n=2: ( frac{2}{3^2} = frac{2}{9} ). Wait, but the second term's exponent was ( frac{2}{3} ), not ( frac{2}{9} ). Hmm, that doesn't match.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the exponents.Wait, let's see:First term: (3^{1/3})Second term: (9^{1/3} = (3^2)^{1/3} = 3^{2/3})Third term: (27^{1/27} = (3^3)^{1/27} = 3^{3/27} = 3^{1/9})Fourth term: (81^{1/81} = (3^4)^{1/81} = 3^{4/81})So, the exponents are: 1/3, 2/3, 1/9, 4/81,...Wait, so the exponents are ( frac{n}{3^n} ) where n is the term number? Let's check:n=1: 1/3^1 = 1/3. Correct.n=2: 2/3^2 = 2/9. But in the second term, the exponent is 2/3, not 2/9. Hmm, that doesn't match.Wait, maybe the exponents are ( frac{n}{3^{n}} ) but starting from n=1, but that doesn't fit the second term.Wait, let's see:First term exponent: 1/3 = 1/3^1Second term exponent: 2/3 = 2/3^1Third term exponent: 1/9 = 1/3^2Fourth term exponent: 4/81 = 4/3^4Wait, that seems inconsistent.Wait, maybe the exponents are ( frac{n}{3^{n}} ) for n=1,2,3,...But then:n=1: 1/3n=2: 2/9n=3: 3/27 = 1/9n=4: 4/81But in the given product, the exponents are 1/3, 2/3, 1/9, 4/81,...So, the second term exponent is 2/3, which is 2/3^1, not 2/3^2.So, perhaps the exponents are ( frac{n}{3^{k}} ) where k is something else.Wait, maybe the exponents are ( frac{n}{3^{n}} ) but with n starting at 1, but the second term is 2/3, which would be n=2, k=1.Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think differently.Let me consider the product as:( prod_{n=1}^{infty} (3^n)^{1/3^n} )Wait, is that the case? Let's check:First term: n=1: (3^1) raised to 1/3^1 = 3^{1/3}Second term: n=2: (3^2) raised to 1/3^2 = 3^{2/9}But in the original product, the second term is 9^{1/3} = 3^{2/3}, not 3^{2/9}. So that doesn't match.Wait, so maybe the exponents are different.Wait, let's see:First term: 3^{1/3}Second term: 9^{1/3} = 3^{2/3}Third term: 27^{1/27} = 3^{3/27} = 3^{1/9}Fourth term: 81^{1/81} = 3^{4/81}So, the exponents are 1/3, 2/3, 1/9, 4/81,...Wait, so the exponents are ( frac{n}{3^{n}} ) where n is 1,2,3,4,...But wait, for n=1: 1/3n=2: 2/3n=3: 3/27 = 1/9n=4: 4/81So, yes, the exponents are ( frac{n}{3^{n}} ) for n=1,2,3,...Therefore, the infinite product can be written as:( prod_{n=1}^{infty} 3^{frac{n}{3^n}} )Which is equal to:( 3^{sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{n}{3^n}} )So, the problem reduces to computing the sum ( S = sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{n}{3^n} ), and then the product is ( 3^S ).Okay, so I need to compute this sum S.I remember that the sum ( sum_{n=1}^{infty} n x^n ) is equal to ( frac{x}{(1 - x)^2} ) for |x| < 1.In this case, x is 1/3, so let's plug that in.So, ( S = sum_{n=1}^{infty} n left( frac{1}{3} right)^n = frac{frac{1}{3}}{(1 - frac{1}{3})^2} )Let's compute that:First, compute the denominator: ( (1 - 1/3) = 2/3 ), so squared is ( (2/3)^2 = 4/9 ).Then, the numerator is 1/3.So, ( S = frac{1/3}{4/9} = frac{1}{3} times frac{9}{4} = frac{3}{4} ).So, the sum S is 3/4.Therefore, the infinite product is ( 3^{3/4} ).Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.So, the product is ( 3^{sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{n}{3^n}} = 3^{3/4} ).Yes, that seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me verify the sum S again.We have ( S = sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{n}{3^n} ).Using the formula ( sum_{n=1}^{infty} n x^n = frac{x}{(1 - x)^2} ), with x = 1/3.So, ( S = frac{1/3}{(1 - 1/3)^2} = frac{1/3}{(2/3)^2} = frac{1/3}{4/9} = (1/3) * (9/4) = 3/4 ). Yep, that's correct.Therefore, the infinite product is ( 3^{3/4} ).Which can also be written as ( sqrt[4]{3^3} = sqrt[4]{27} ).Alternatively, ( 3^{3/4} ) is the same as ( e^{(3/4) ln 3} ), but I think the simplest form is ( 3^{3/4} ).So, the final answer is ( 3^{3/4} ).**Final Answer**The infinite product is equal to boxed{3^{frac{3}{4}}}."},{"question":"Given a regular quadrangular prism (ABCD-A_1B_1C_1D_1) with the base (ABCD) being a unit square, if the dihedral angle (A_1-BD-C_1) is (frac{pi}{3}), find (AA_1).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a regular quadrangular prism, which is basically a rectangular box with a square base. The base is ABCD, and it's a unit square, so each side of the base is 1 unit long. The prism has another square face on top, which is A1B1C1D1. The question is asking me to find the length of AA1, which is the height of the prism, given that the dihedral angle A1-BD-C1 is π/3.Hmm, dihedral angle. I remember that a dihedral angle is the angle between two planes. So, in this case, the dihedral angle along the edge BD between the two planes A1-BD and C1-BD is π/3. I need to visualize this.First, let me sketch the prism in my mind. The base is ABCD, a square. So, points A, B, C, D are arranged in a square, each side length 1. The top face is A1B1C1D1, so each of these points is directly above their respective base points. So, AA1 is the vertical edge from A to A1, and similarly for the others.BD is the diagonal of the base square from B to D. So, BD is a space diagonal in the base. Now, the dihedral angle is between the two planes that meet along BD. One plane is A1-BD, which would be the plane containing points A1, B, and D. The other plane is C1-BD, containing points C1, B, and D.So, the dihedral angle between these two planes is π/3. I need to find the length of AA1, which is the height of the prism.I think I can approach this by finding the normal vectors of the two planes A1BD and C1BD, and then using the dot product to find the angle between them. The dihedral angle is equal to the angle between the normal vectors, or maybe its supplement. I need to be careful about that.First, let's assign coordinates to the points to make this more concrete. Let me place the square ABCD on the xy-plane with point A at the origin.So, let's say:- A is (0, 0, 0)- B is (1, 0, 0)- C is (1, 1, 0)- D is (0, 1, 0)Then, the top points are:- A1 is (0, 0, h), where h is the height AA1 that we need to find.- B1 is (1, 0, h)- C1 is (1, 1, h)- D1 is (0, 1, h)So, BD is the diagonal from B(1,0,0) to D(0,1,0). The plane A1BD contains points A1(0,0,h), B(1,0,0), and D(0,1,0). Similarly, the plane C1BD contains points C1(1,1,h), B(1,0,0), and D(0,1,0).Now, to find the dihedral angle between these two planes, I need the normal vectors of each plane.Let's find the normal vector for plane A1BD. To do this, I can take two vectors lying on this plane and compute their cross product.First, vector BA1 is from B to A1: A1 - B = (0-1, 0-0, h-0) = (-1, 0, h)Vector BD is from B to D: D - B = (0-1, 1-0, 0-0) = (-1, 1, 0)So, vectors BA1 = (-1, 0, h) and BD = (-1, 1, 0)The cross product of BA1 and BD will give the normal vector N1.Calculating N1 = BA1 × BD:|i     j     k||-1    0     h||-1    1     0|So, determinant:i*(0*0 - h*1) - j*(-1*0 - h*(-1)) + k*(-1*1 - 0*(-1))= i*(0 - h) - j*(0 + h) + k*(-1 - 0)= (-h)i - (h)j -1kSo, N1 = (-h, -h, -1)Similarly, for plane C1BD, let's find two vectors.Vector BC1 is from B to C1: C1 - B = (1-1, 1-0, h-0) = (0, 1, h)Vector BD is the same as before: (-1, 1, 0)So, vectors BC1 = (0, 1, h) and BD = (-1, 1, 0)Cross product N2 = BC1 × BD:|i     j     k||0     1     h||-1    1     0|Determinant:i*(1*0 - h*1) - j*(0*0 - h*(-1)) + k*(0*1 - 1*(-1))= i*(0 - h) - j*(0 + h) + k*(0 + 1)= (-h)i - (h)j +1kSo, N2 = (-h, -h, 1)Now, the dihedral angle between the two planes is equal to the angle between N1 and N2. But wait, actually, the dihedral angle can be either the angle between the normals or its supplement, depending on the orientation. So, we need to be careful.Given that the dihedral angle is π/3, which is 60 degrees, an acute angle. So, if the angle between normals is acute, that's the dihedral angle. If it's obtuse, we take the supplement.So, let's compute the cosine of the angle between N1 and N2.The formula is:cosθ = (N1 • N2) / (|N1| |N2|)Compute the dot product N1 • N2:(-h)(-h) + (-h)(-h) + (-1)(1) = h² + h² -1 = 2h² -1Compute |N1|:|N1| = sqrt((-h)^2 + (-h)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(h² + h² + 1) = sqrt(2h² +1)Similarly, |N2| is the same as |N1|, since N2 is (-h, -h, 1), so:|N2| = sqrt((-h)^2 + (-h)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(2h² +1)So, cosθ = (2h² -1)/(2h² +1)Given that the dihedral angle is π/3, so θ = π/3, so cosθ = 0.5Therefore:(2h² -1)/(2h² +1) = 0.5Let me solve for h.Multiply both sides by (2h² +1):2h² -1 = 0.5*(2h² +1)Simplify the right side:0.5*(2h² +1) = h² + 0.5So, equation becomes:2h² -1 = h² + 0.5Subtract h² from both sides:h² -1 = 0.5Add 1 to both sides:h² = 1.5So, h = sqrt(1.5) = sqrt(3/2) = (√6)/2Wait, hold on. Let me double-check.Wait, 2h² -1 = h² + 0.5Subtract h²: h² -1 = 0.5Add 1: h² = 1.5Yes, so h = sqrt(3/2) or h = (√6)/2, since sqrt(3/2) = √6 / 2.So, AA1 is (√6)/2 units long.But wait, just to make sure, let me think about the dihedral angle.Is the angle between the normals equal to the dihedral angle, or is it supplementary?Because sometimes, depending on the orientation of the normals, the angle between normals could be the supplement of the dihedral angle.So, if the dihedral angle is π/3, then the angle between normals could be π/3 or 2π/3.But in our case, the normals are N1 = (-h, -h, -1) and N2 = (-h, -h, 1). So, their z-components are opposite.So, the angle between them could be acute or obtuse.But in our calculation, we found that cosθ = (2h² -1)/(2h² +1) = 0.5Which gives θ = π/3.But let's see, if θ is the angle between N1 and N2, and the dihedral angle is π/3, is θ equal to the dihedral angle or its supplement?Wait, the dihedral angle is the angle between the two planes, which is equal to the angle between the normals if they are pointing towards each other, or the supplement if they are pointing away.But in our case, since N1 is pointing in the negative z-direction and N2 is pointing in the positive z-direction, the angle between them is actually the angle between the normals, which is π/3.But wait, let's think about the orientation.Alternatively, the dihedral angle can be computed as the angle between the two planes, which is equal to the angle between their normals or its supplement.But in our case, the dihedral angle is given as π/3, so it's acute. So, if the angle between normals is acute, then that's the dihedral angle.But wait, in our calculation, we found that cosθ = 0.5, which is π/3, so that's consistent.Therefore, h = sqrt(3/2) = √6 / 2.So, AA1 is √6 / 2.Wait, but let me think again.Alternatively, sometimes dihedral angles are measured as the angle you would see when looking along the edge, so it's the angle between the two planes, which can be calculated via the normals.But in our case, the normals are pointing in opposite directions in the z-axis, so the angle between them is acute, which is π/3, which is what we have.So, I think our calculation is correct.Therefore, AA1 is √6 / 2.But just to be thorough, let me compute the angle between the normals.Given N1 = (-h, -h, -1), N2 = (-h, -h, 1)Dot product: (-h)(-h) + (-h)(-h) + (-1)(1) = h² + h² -1 = 2h² -1|N1| = sqrt(2h² +1), same as |N2|So, cosθ = (2h² -1)/(2h² +1)Set this equal to cos(π/3) = 0.5So, (2h² -1)/(2h² +1) = 0.5Multiply both sides by denominator:2h² -1 = 0.5*(2h² +1)2h² -1 = h² + 0.5Subtract h²:h² -1 = 0.5h² = 1.5h = sqrt(1.5) = sqrt(3/2) = √6 / 2Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, if I consider the dihedral angle as the angle between the two planes, which is the angle between their normals or 180 minus that. Since the dihedral angle is given as π/3, which is acute, and our calculation gives an acute angle, so it's correct.Therefore, the length of AA1 is √6 / 2.**Final Answer**The length of (AA_1) is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{6}}{2}}."},{"question":"Let[f(x) = frac{ax}{x + 1}.]Find the constant a so that f(f(x)) = x for all x neq -1.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = (a x)/(x + 1), and I need to find the constant a such that when I compose f with itself, meaning f(f(x)), it equals x for all x not equal to -1. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that function composition means plugging one function into another. So, f(f(x)) means I take the output of f(x) and plug it back into f. Let me write that down.So, f(f(x)) = f((a x)/(x + 1)). That makes sense. Now, I need to compute this. Let me substitute (a x)/(x + 1) into f wherever there's an x.So, f(u) = (a u)/(u + 1), where u is (a x)/(x + 1). Therefore, f(f(x)) = [a * (a x)/(x + 1)] / [ (a x)/(x + 1) + 1 ].Alright, let me simplify the numerator and the denominator separately. The numerator is straightforward: a times (a x)/(x + 1) is (a^2 x)/(x + 1).Now, the denominator is (a x)/(x + 1) + 1. To add these together, I need a common denominator. The 1 can be written as (x + 1)/(x + 1). So, adding them gives [a x + (x + 1)]/(x + 1).Let me write that out: denominator = [a x + x + 1]/(x + 1). So, combining like terms in the numerator: (a + 1)x + 1, all over (x + 1).So now, f(f(x)) is [ (a^2 x)/(x + 1) ] divided by [ ( (a + 1)x + 1 )/(x + 1) ].Dividing two fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so this becomes [a^2 x / (x + 1)] * [ (x + 1) / ( (a + 1)x + 1 ) ].I notice that (x + 1) cancels out in numerator and denominator, so we're left with (a^2 x) / [ (a + 1)x + 1 ].So, f(f(x)) simplifies to (a^2 x) / [ (a + 1)x + 1 ].But the problem states that f(f(x)) should equal x for all x ≠ -1. So, I can set up the equation:(a^2 x) / [ (a + 1)x + 1 ] = x.Now, I need to solve for a such that this equation holds for all x ≠ -1. Let me cross-multiply to eliminate the denominator:a^2 x = x * [ (a + 1)x + 1 ].Let me expand the right-hand side:a^2 x = (a + 1)x^2 + x.Now, let's bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:(a + 1)x^2 + x - a^2 x = 0.Simplify the terms with x:(a + 1)x^2 + (1 - a^2)x = 0.Factor out an x:x [ (a + 1)x + (1 - a^2) ] = 0.So, this equation is satisfied either when x = 0 or when (a + 1)x + (1 - a^2) = 0.But the original condition is that f(f(x)) = x for all x ≠ -1. So, this equation must hold for all x ≠ -1, not just specific x values. Therefore, the coefficient of x in the quadratic equation must be zero, and the constant term must also be zero.Wait, hold on. Let me think again. The equation is x [ (a + 1)x + (1 - a^2) ] = 0. For this to hold for all x ≠ -1, the expression in the brackets must be zero for all x. But that's only possible if both coefficients are zero.So, we have two equations:1. The coefficient of x^2: (a + 1) = 0.2. The constant term: (1 - a^2) = 0.Let me write that down:1. a + 1 = 02. 1 - a^2 = 0From the first equation, a + 1 = 0 implies a = -1.From the second equation, 1 - a^2 = 0 implies a^2 = 1, so a = ±1.So, the solutions from the two equations are a = -1 and a = ±1. Therefore, the common solution is a = -1.Wait, but let me verify this. If a = -1, then f(x) = (-1 x)/(x + 1) = -x/(x + 1). Let's compute f(f(x)).Compute f(f(x)) when a = -1:First, f(x) = -x/(x + 1).Then f(f(x)) = f(-x/(x + 1)) = [ -(-x/(x + 1)) ] / [ (-x/(x + 1)) + 1 ].Simplify numerator: -(-x/(x + 1)) = x/(x + 1).Denominator: (-x/(x + 1)) + 1 = (-x + (x + 1))/(x + 1) = ( -x + x + 1 )/(x + 1) = 1/(x + 1).So, f(f(x)) = [x/(x + 1)] / [1/(x + 1)] = [x/(x + 1)] * [(x + 1)/1] = x.So, yes, when a = -1, f(f(x)) = x. That works.But wait, earlier when solving the equations, I had a = -1 from the first equation and a = ±1 from the second. So, a = -1 is the only common solution. So, that must be the answer.But just to make sure, let's test a = 1 as well, even though it's not a common solution.If a = 1, then f(x) = x/(x + 1). Let's compute f(f(x)):f(f(x)) = f(x/(x + 1)) = [1*(x/(x + 1))]/[ (x/(x + 1)) + 1 ].Simplify numerator: x/(x + 1).Denominator: x/(x + 1) + 1 = [x + (x + 1)]/(x + 1) = (2x + 1)/(x + 1).So, f(f(x)) = [x/(x + 1)] / [(2x + 1)/(x + 1)] = x/(2x + 1).Which is not equal to x unless x = 0, but it's supposed to hold for all x ≠ -1. So, a = 1 doesn't work, which is why a = -1 is the correct solution.Therefore, the constant a is -1.**Final Answer**The constant ( a ) is boxed{-1}."},{"question":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, the common ratio q=2, and the sum of the first n terms is S_n. If S_5=1, then S_{10}= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me read it again: In the geometric sequence {a_n}, the common ratio q is 2, and the sum of the first n terms is S_n. It's given that S_5 = 1, and I need to find S_{10}. Hmm, okay.First, I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by the common ratio. So, if the first term is a, then the sequence goes a, 2a, 4a, 8a, and so on. The sum of the first n terms, S_n, can be calculated using the formula:S_n = a * (1 - q^n) / (1 - q)Since q is 2, which is greater than 1, the formula should still hold. Let me write that down:S_n = a * (1 - 2^n) / (1 - 2)Simplify the denominator: 1 - 2 is -1, so:S_n = a * (1 - 2^n) / (-1) = a * (2^n - 1)Okay, so S_n = a*(2^n - 1). Got that.Now, it's given that S_5 = 1. Let's plug n = 5 into the formula:S_5 = a*(2^5 - 1) = a*(32 - 1) = a*31 = 1So, a*31 = 1. Therefore, a = 1/31.Alright, so the first term a is 1/31. Now, I need to find S_{10}. Let's use the same formula:S_{10} = a*(2^{10} - 1)We already know a is 1/31, so:S_{10} = (1/31)*(1024 - 1) = (1/31)*1023Hmm, 1023 divided by 31. Let me compute that. 31 times 32 is 992, right? Because 30*32=960 and 1*32=32, so 960+32=992. Then 1023 - 992 = 31. So, 1023 is 32*31 + 31, which is 31*(32 + 1) = 31*33. So, 1023 = 31*33.Therefore, S_{10} = (1/31)*(31*33) = 33.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my calculations.First, S_5 = a*(2^5 - 1) = a*31 = 1, so a = 1/31. Correct.Then, S_{10} = a*(2^{10} - 1) = (1/31)*(1024 - 1) = (1/31)*1023. Since 31*33 = 1023, this simplifies to 33. That seems right.Alternatively, maybe I can think of S_{10} in terms of S_5. Since the sequence is geometric with ratio 2, the sum from term 6 to term 10 is just S_5 multiplied by 2^5. Let me see:The first five terms sum to S_5 = 1. The next five terms would be each of those terms multiplied by 2^5, right? Because each term is double the previous one, so the sixth term is 2^5 times the first term, the seventh term is 2^5 times the second term, and so on.Therefore, the sum from term 6 to term 10 is S_5 * 2^5 = 1 * 32 = 32. So, the total sum S_{10} is S_5 + 32 = 1 + 32 = 33. Yep, that's another way to get the same answer.So, both methods give me 33. That gives me more confidence that 33 is the correct answer.Just to recap:1. Found the first term a using S_5 = 1.2. Plugged a into the formula for S_{10}.3. Alternatively, broke down S_{10} into S_5 plus the sum of the next five terms, which is S_5 multiplied by 2^5.4. Both methods gave me 33.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 33.**Final Answer**The value of ( S_{10} ) is boxed{33}."},{"question":"Given ( sin x = 3 cos x ), what is ( sin x cos x ) equal to?(A) (frac{1}{6})(B) (frac{1}{5})(C) (frac{2}{9})(D) (frac{1}{4})(E) (frac{3}{10})","answer":"Okay, so I have this trigonometry problem here: Given that sin x equals 3 cos x, I need to find what sin x cos x is equal to.

The problem gives me sin x = 3 cos x, so perhaps I can substitute that into the identity to find the value of cos x or sin x.Let me write down what I know:sin x = 3 cos x.So, if I substitute sin x in the Pythagorean identity, I get:(3 cos x)² + cos²x = 1.Let me compute that:First, square 3 cos x: (3 cos x)² = 9 cos²x.So, substituting back:9 cos²x + cos²x = 1.Combine like terms:9 cos²x + cos²x is 10 cos²x.So, 10 cos²x = 1.To solve for cos²x, divide both sides by 10:cos²x = 1/10.Therefore, cos x is either sqrt(1/10) or -sqrt(1/10). But since the problem doesn't specify the quadrant where angle x is, I think we can assume it's positive for simplicity, unless told otherwise. So, cos x = sqrt(1/10).Simplify sqrt(1/10): that's 1 over sqrt(10), which can be rationalized as sqrt(10)/10.So, cos x = sqrt(10)/10.Now, since sin x = 3 cos x, let's find sin x:sin x = 3 * (sqrt(10)/10) = 3 sqrt(10)/10.Okay, so now I have both sin x and cos x:sin x = 3 sqrt(10)/10,cos x = sqrt(10)/10.The question asks for sin x cos x, so let me compute that:sin x cos x = (3 sqrt(10)/10) * (sqrt(10)/10).Multiply the numerators and denominators:Numerator: 3 sqrt(10) * sqrt(10) = 3 * (sqrt(10))² = 3 * 10 = 30.Denominator: 10 * 10 = 100.So, sin x cos x = 30/100.Simplify that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 10, which gives 3/10.Wait, 30 divided by 10 is 3, and 100 divided by 10 is 10. So, 3/10.Looking back at the options, E is 3/10. So, that should be the answer.But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Start with sin x = 3 cos x.2. Substitute into sin²x + cos²x = 1:   (3 cos x)² + cos²x = 1 => 9 cos²x + cos²x = 10 cos²x = 1.3. So, cos²x = 1/10 => cos x = sqrt(1/10) or -sqrt(1/10).4. Assuming positive, cos x = sqrt(10)/10.5. Then sin x = 3 * sqrt(10)/10.6. Multiply sin x and cos x: (3 sqrt(10)/10) * (sqrt(10)/10) = 3 * 10 / 100 = 30/100 = 3/10.Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is E) 3/10.Wait, but let me think again. The problem didn't specify the quadrant, so cos x could be negative as well. If cos x is negative, then sin x would also be negative because sin x = 3 cos x. So, sin x cos x would be positive in that case as well because negative times negative is positive.So, regardless of the quadrant, sin x cos x is positive and equal to 3/10. So, my answer is still correct.Alternatively, another method: Maybe using tan x.Since sin x = 3 cos x, divide both sides by cos x (assuming cos x ≠ 0):tan x = 3.So, tan x = 3, which means x is an angle whose tangent is 3.Then, to find sin x cos x, perhaps we can express it in terms of tan x.I remember that sin x cos x can be written as (sin 2x)/2, but I'm not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, since tan x = 3, we can think of a right triangle where the opposite side is 3 and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse would be sqrt(1² + 3²) = sqrt(10).Therefore, sin x = opposite/hypotenuse = 3/sqrt(10) = 3 sqrt(10)/10,and cos x = adjacent/hypotenuse = 1/sqrt(10) = sqrt(10)/10.So, sin x cos x = (3 sqrt(10)/10)(sqrt(10)/10) = 3*10/100 = 30/100 = 3/10.Same result. So, definitely, E is the correct answer.Just to make sure, let me compute sin x cos x numerically.Compute sin x: 3 sqrt(10)/10 ≈ 3 * 3.1623 / 10 ≈ 9.4869 / 10 ≈ 0.94869.Compute cos x: sqrt(10)/10 ≈ 3.1623 / 10 ≈ 0.31623.Multiply them: 0.94869 * 0.31623 ≈ 0.3000, which is approximately 3/10.Yes, that checks out numerically as well.So, I'm confident that the answer is E) 3/10.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"If the equation x^{2}+3x+a=0 has one root as -1, then the other root is ____.","answer":"First, I recognize that the given quadratic equation is ( x^2 + 3x + a = 0 ) and that one of its roots is ( -1 ).To find the value of ( a ), I can substitute ( x = -1 ) into the equation:[(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + a = 0]Simplifying this, I get:[1 - 3 + a = 0][-2 + a = 0][a = 2]Now that I have ( a = 2 ), the equation becomes ( x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0 ).To find the other root, I can factor the quadratic equation:[x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2) = 0]Setting each factor equal to zero gives the roots:[x + 1 = 0 quad Rightarrow quad x = -1][x + 2 = 0 quad Rightarrow quad x = -2]Since one root is ( -1 ), the other root must be ( -2 )."},{"question":"On the last night that roller skate rink was open, 40 people showed up to roller skate one last time.

There are two factories, Factory A and Factory B, both capable of processing these products. The company sent relevant personnel to both factories to gather information, and obtained the following details:- Information 1: Factory A, working alone, would take 10 more days to complete the processing of these products than Factory B working alone.- Information 2: The daily processing capacity of Factory B is 1.5 times that of Factory A.Based on the information above, calculate how many new products each factory can process daily.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a company wants to refine 1200 new products before launching them. They have two factories, Factory A and Factory B, that can process these products. The company has given me two pieces of information:1. Factory A, working alone, would take 10 more days to complete the processing than Factory B working alone.2. The daily processing capacity of Factory B is 1.5 times that of Factory A.I need to figure out how many products each factory can process daily. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, let me assign some variables to make this easier. Let's say the daily processing capacity of Factory A is ( x ) products per day. Then, according to Information 2, Factory B's daily capacity would be ( 1.5x ) products per day. That makes sense because 1.5 times A's capacity is B's capacity.Now, the total number of products to process is 1200. So, if Factory A is working alone, the time it would take to process all 1200 products is the total number divided by its daily capacity. That would be ( frac{1200}{x} ) days. Similarly, for Factory B, the time would be ( frac{1200}{1.5x} ) days.But wait, Information 1 says that Factory A takes 10 more days than Factory B. So, the time taken by Factory A is equal to the time taken by Factory B plus 10 days. In equation form, that would be:[frac{1200}{x} = frac{1200}{1.5x} + 10]Okay, so now I have an equation with one variable, ( x ). I need to solve for ( x ). Let me simplify this equation step by step.First, let's compute ( frac{1200}{1.5x} ). Since 1.5 is the same as ( frac{3}{2} ), dividing by 1.5 is the same as multiplying by ( frac{2}{3} ). So,[frac{1200}{1.5x} = frac{1200 times 2}{3x} = frac{2400}{3x} = frac{800}{x}]So, substituting back into the equation, we have:[frac{1200}{x} = frac{800}{x} + 10]Hmm, okay. Let me subtract ( frac{800}{x} ) from both sides to get:[frac{1200}{x} - frac{800}{x} = 10]Simplifying the left side:[frac{400}{x} = 10]So, now we have:[frac{400}{x} = 10]To solve for ( x ), I can multiply both sides by ( x ):[400 = 10x]Then, divide both sides by 10:[x = 40]So, Factory A can process 40 products per day. Then, Factory B, which has 1.5 times the capacity, would process:[1.5 times 40 = 60]Therefore, Factory A processes 40 products daily, and Factory B processes 60 products daily.Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, if Factory A processes 40 per day, it would take ( frac{1200}{40} = 30 ) days. Factory B processes 60 per day, so it would take ( frac{1200}{60} = 20 ) days. The difference is indeed 10 days, which matches Information 1. Also, 60 is 1.5 times 40, which matches Information 2. So, everything checks out.I think that's solid. I didn't make any calculation errors, and the logic follows. So, the daily processing capacities are 40 for Factory A and 60 for Factory B.**Final Answer**Factory A can process boxed{40} products daily, and Factory B can process boxed{60} products daily."},{"question":"A certain electronics factory produces a type of computer graphics card. In 2021, the factory price of this type of computer graphics card is 200 yuan per unit. In 2022 and 2023, with the help of technological poverty alleviation, the technology is improved to reduce costs. In 2023, the factory price of this computer graphics card is adjusted to 162 yuan per unit.(1) The percentage decrease in the factory price of this type of computer graphics card is the same for these two years. Find the average annual percentage decrease.(2) In 2023, a certain Seg computer city purchases a certain number of this type of computer graphics card at the factory price. When selling at 200 yuan per unit, they can sell an average of 20 units per day. In order to reduce inventory quickly, the store decides to reduce the price for sale. After investigation, it is found that for every 1 yuan reduction in price, they can sell an additional 2 units per day. If they make a daily profit of 1150 yuan, how much should the price be reduced per unit?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a computer graphics card factory and a store. It's divided into two parts. Let me tackle them one by one.Starting with part (1): The factory price decreased from 200 yuan in 2021 to 162 yuan in 2023. The percentage decrease each year is the same. I need to find the average annual percentage decrease.Hmm, okay. So, it's a two-year period, right? From 2021 to 2022 is one year, and 2022 to 2023 is another. So, the price decreases by the same percentage each year. That sounds like a geometric sequence or exponential decay.Let me denote the percentage decrease as 'r' (in decimal form). So, each year, the price is multiplied by (1 - r). Starting from 200 yuan, after two years, it becomes 162 yuan.So, mathematically, that would be:200 * (1 - r)^2 = 162I need to solve for 'r'. Let me write that equation down:200*(1 - r)^2 = 162First, divide both sides by 200 to simplify:(1 - r)^2 = 162 / 200Calculate 162 divided by 200. Let me do that:162 ÷ 200 = 0.81So, (1 - r)^2 = 0.81Now, take the square root of both sides to solve for (1 - r):√(0.81) = 0.9So, 1 - r = 0.9Therefore, r = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1So, the percentage decrease each year is 0.1, which is 10%.Wait, let me double-check that. If the price decreases by 10% each year, starting at 200:First year: 200 - 10% of 200 = 200 - 20 = 180Second year: 180 - 10% of 180 = 180 - 18 = 162Yes, that matches the given price in 2023. So, the average annual percentage decrease is 10%.Cool, that seems straightforward.Moving on to part (2): In 2023, a store buys these graphics cards at the factory price of 162 yuan each. They sell them at 200 yuan each and can sell an average of 20 units per day. To reduce inventory, they decide to lower the price. For every 1 yuan reduction, they can sell 2 additional units per day. They want to make a daily profit of 1150 yuan. How much should they reduce the price per unit?Alright, let's parse this.First, the cost price per unit is 162 yuan. The selling price is initially 200 yuan, but they can reduce it. For each 1 yuan reduction, they sell 2 more units.Let me denote the price reduction as 'x' yuan. So, the selling price becomes (200 - x) yuan per unit.The number of units sold per day is initially 20, and for each 1 yuan reduction, it increases by 2 units. So, the number of units sold becomes (20 + 2x).Now, profit is calculated as (Selling Price - Cost Price) * Number of Units Sold.So, the profit per unit is (200 - x - 162) yuan, which simplifies to (38 - x) yuan.The number of units sold is (20 + 2x).So, total profit is (38 - x)*(20 + 2x).They want this total profit to be 1150 yuan. So, set up the equation:(38 - x)*(20 + 2x) = 1150Let me expand this equation:First, multiply 38 by 20: 38*20 = 760Then, 38*2x = 76xThen, -x*20 = -20xThen, -x*2x = -2x^2So, putting it all together:760 + 76x - 20x - 2x^2 = 1150Combine like terms:760 + (76x - 20x) - 2x^2 = 1150760 + 56x - 2x^2 = 1150Let me rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:-2x^2 + 56x + 760 - 1150 = 0Calculate 760 - 1150: that's -390.So, -2x^2 + 56x - 390 = 0I can multiply both sides by -1 to make the quadratic coefficient positive:2x^2 - 56x + 390 = 0Now, let's see if we can simplify this equation. All coefficients are even, so divide by 2:x^2 - 28x + 195 = 0Now, we have a quadratic equation: x^2 - 28x + 195 = 0Let me try to factor this. I need two numbers that multiply to 195 and add up to -28.Wait, 195 factors into 15 and 13, because 15*13=195. 15 +13=28. So, since the middle term is -28x, both numbers are negative.So, (x - 15)(x - 13) = 0Therefore, x = 15 or x = 13.So, the solutions are x = 15 or x =13.Wait, but we need to check if these make sense in the context.Let me test x=15:Selling price: 200 -15=185 yuanNumber sold: 20 +2*15=50 unitsProfit per unit: 185 -162=23 yuanTotal profit:23*50=1150 yuan. Perfect.Now, x=13:Selling price:200 -13=187 yuanNumber sold:20 +2*13=46 unitsProfit per unit:187 -162=25 yuanTotal profit:25*46=1150 yuan. Also perfect.So, both x=13 and x=15 satisfy the equation.But wait, the question says \\"how much should the price be reduced per unit?\\" So, does that mean multiple solutions? Or is there a constraint I'm missing?Looking back at the problem statement: \\"for every 1 yuan reduction in price, they can sell an additional 2 units per day.\\" It doesn't specify any upper limit on the price reduction, so both 13 and 15 yuan reductions are possible.But in the context, they want to reduce inventory quickly. So, perhaps they would prefer the larger reduction, which is 15 yuan, as it leads to selling more units (50 vs. 46). But the problem doesn't specify that they need to minimize the price or maximize the units sold, just that they need to make a daily profit of 1150 yuan.So, both reductions are possible. However, in the quadratic equation, we have two solutions, so both are mathematically valid.But let me check if both are feasible. For x=15, the selling price is 185, which is above the cost price of 162, so they still make a profit per unit. Similarly, for x=13, the selling price is 187, which is also above 162.So, both are feasible. Therefore, the possible price reductions are 13 yuan and 15 yuan.But the problem asks \\"how much should the price be reduced per unit?\\" It doesn't specify if it's the minimal reduction or the maximal. Hmm.Wait, in the context of wanting to reduce inventory quickly, perhaps the store would prefer a larger price reduction to sell more units. So, maybe 15 yuan is the answer they are looking for.But let me check the calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, when x=15, the profit is 23*50=1150. When x=13, it's 25*46=1150. So, both are correct.But perhaps the problem expects both solutions? Or maybe I need to consider that x must be an integer? Since they reduce by 1 yuan increments, x must be an integer. Both 13 and 15 are integers, so both are acceptable.But the problem says \\"how much should the price be reduced per unit?\\" It might expect a single answer. Maybe I need to see if both are acceptable or if one is extraneous.Wait, let me think about the quadratic equation again. The equation was x^2 -28x +195=0, which factors into (x-15)(x-13)=0. So, both are roots. So, both are valid.But perhaps the problem expects both solutions? Or maybe only one is applicable.Wait, let me think about the relationship between the number sold and the price. When you reduce the price, the number sold increases. So, if you reduce by 13 yuan, you sell 46 units, and if you reduce by 15 yuan, you sell 50 units. Both are valid, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the number of units or the price, just the profit.Therefore, both are correct. So, the price should be reduced by either 13 yuan or 15 yuan per unit.But the problem says \\"how much should the price be reduced per unit?\\" It might expect both answers. But in the original problem statement, it's likely expecting a single answer. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.Wait, let me double-check the setup.Profit per unit is (200 - x -162) = (38 - x). Number sold is (20 + 2x). So, profit is (38 -x)(20 +2x)=1150.Yes, that seems correct.Expanding: 38*20 +38*2x -x*20 -x*2x=760 +76x -20x -2x²=760 +56x -2x²=1150.Then, moving 1150 to the left: -2x² +56x +760 -1150= -2x² +56x -390=0.Multiply by -1: 2x² -56x +390=0.Divide by 2: x² -28x +195=0.Factored as (x-15)(x-13)=0.So, that's correct.So, both solutions are valid. Therefore, the price can be reduced by either 13 or 15 yuan.But in the context of the problem, the store wants to reduce inventory quickly. So, selling more units would help reduce inventory faster. Therefore, reducing the price by 15 yuan would result in selling 50 units per day, which is more than 46 units with a 13 yuan reduction. So, perhaps the answer is 15 yuan.But the problem doesn't specify that they want to minimize the price or maximize the units sold, just that they want to make a daily profit of 1150 yuan. So, technically, both are correct. But since it's a math problem, it's likely expecting both solutions.Wait, but in the original problem, it's part (2), and it's a single question. So, maybe I need to present both answers.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.Wait, let me think again. The cost price is 162, selling price is 200 -x, so profit per unit is (200 -x -162)=38 -x. Number sold is 20 +2x. So, profit is (38 -x)(20 +2x)=1150.Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the minimal reduction, which is 13 yuan, but I'm not sure.Wait, let me check the calculations again.For x=13:Selling price=200-13=187Units sold=20+26=46Profit per unit=187-162=25Total profit=25*46=1150. Correct.For x=15:Selling price=200-15=185Units sold=20+30=50Profit per unit=185-162=23Total profit=23*50=1150. Correct.So, both are correct. Therefore, the price reduction can be either 13 or 15 yuan.But the problem says \\"how much should the price be reduced per unit?\\" It might expect both answers, but in the context of the problem, since they want to reduce inventory quickly, they might prefer the larger reduction, which is 15 yuan.Alternatively, maybe I need to present both solutions.But let me check if the problem allows for multiple answers. It doesn't specify, so perhaps both are acceptable.Wait, but in the quadratic equation, both roots are valid, so both are correct. Therefore, the answer is that the price should be reduced by either 13 yuan or 15 yuan per unit.But in the context of the problem, since they want to reduce inventory quickly, they might choose the larger reduction. So, 15 yuan.But I'm not sure. Maybe the problem expects both answers.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.Wait, another way to think about it: Maybe the profit is (Selling Price - Cost Price) * Quantity Sold.So, (200 -x -162)*(20 +2x)=1150.Which is (38 -x)(20 +2x)=1150.Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the number of yuan reduction, so both 13 and 15 are correct.But since it's a math problem, and the quadratic gives two solutions, both are valid. So, the answer is 13 or 15 yuan.But in the problem statement, it's part (2), so maybe it's expecting both answers.Alternatively, perhaps I need to write both.But in the original problem, it's likely expecting both solutions, so I should present both.But let me check the calculation again.Wait, when x=13, the selling price is 187, which is 25 profit per unit, selling 46 units, total 1150.When x=15, selling price is 185, profit per unit 23, selling 50 units, total 1150.Yes, both correct.Therefore, the price should be reduced by either 13 yuan or 15 yuan per unit.But the problem says \\"how much should the price be reduced per unit?\\" It might expect both answers, but in the context, perhaps the larger reduction is better for inventory.But since the problem doesn't specify, both are correct.Wait, but in the quadratic equation, sometimes one solution might not make sense in context, but here both do.So, I think the answer is that the price should be reduced by 13 yuan or 15 yuan per unit.But the problem might expect both answers, so I should present both.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup.Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem expects the price reduction to be an integer, which both 13 and 15 are, so both are acceptable.Therefore, the answer is that the price should be reduced by either 13 yuan or 15 yuan per unit.But in the problem, it's part (2), so maybe it's expecting both answers.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only one answer, so maybe I need to see which one is correct.Wait, let me think about the quadratic equation again. The equation is x² -28x +195=0, which factors into (x-15)(x-13)=0. So, both are correct.Therefore, the price reduction can be either 13 or 15 yuan.But in the context of the problem, since they want to reduce inventory quickly, they would prefer the larger reduction, which is 15 yuan.But the problem doesn't specify that they need to maximize the number of units sold, just that they want to make a daily profit of 1150 yuan.Therefore, both are correct.But since the problem is in Chinese, and in the original problem, it might expect both answers.But in the context of the problem, it's likely that both are acceptable.Therefore, the answer is that the price should be reduced by either 13 yuan or 15 yuan per unit.But in the problem, it's part (2), so maybe it's expecting both answers.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only one answer, so maybe I need to see which one is correct.Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem expects the minimal reduction, which is 13 yuan, but I'm not sure.But since both are correct, I think the answer is that the price should be reduced by either 13 yuan or 15 yuan per unit.But in the problem, it's likely expecting both answers.So, to sum up:(1) The average annual percentage decrease is 10%.(2) The price should be reduced by either 13 yuan or 15 yuan per unit.But in the problem, part (2) might expect both answers, so I should present both.But in the original problem, it's part (2), so maybe it's expecting both answers.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only one answer, so maybe I need to see which one is correct.Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem expects the price reduction to be an integer, which both 13 and 15 are, so both are acceptable.Therefore, the answer is that the price should be reduced by either 13 yuan or 15 yuan per unit.But in the problem, it's likely expecting both answers.So, I think that's the conclusion.**Final Answer**(1) The average annual percentage decrease is boxed{10%}.(2) The price should be reduced by boxed{13} yuan or boxed{15} yuan per unit."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},z=["disabled"],D={key:0},N={key:1};function M(a,e,h,d,o,n){const u=p("PoemCard");return i(),s("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 DeepSeek-R1 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",L,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[g,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",F,[(i(!0),s(y,null,w(n.filteredPoems,(r,f)=>(i(),x(u,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(i(),s("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...r))},[o.isLoading?(i(),s("span",N,"Loading...")):(i(),s("span",D,"See more"))],8,z)):v("",!0)])}const H=m(C,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-06e82e22"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"deepseek/54.md","filePath":"deepseek/54.md"}'),P={name:"deepseek/54.md"},E=Object.assign(P,{setup(a){return(e,h)=>(i(),s("div",null,[S(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,E as default};
