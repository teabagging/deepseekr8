To achieve this balance in his workout routine, Bruce decides to train both his physical strength and mental focus. 1. He designs a workout plan where the number of push-ups he does, ( p ), is three times the number of minutes he spends meditating, ( m ), minus 4. Represent this relationship with an equation and solve for ( m ) if Bruce does 38 push-ups.2. Bruce's goal is to balance his physical and mental training such that the product of the minutes spent meditating, ( m ), and the number of push-ups, ( p ), matches his lucky number 108, inspired by Eastern philosophy. Create a quadratic equation using the relationship from the first sub-problem and solve for the number of minutes, ( m ), Bruce spends meditating.","answer":"First, I'll address the first part of the problem. Bruce's workout plan states that the number of push-ups he does, ( p ), is three times the number of minutes he spends meditating, ( m ), minus 4. This relationship can be expressed as ( p = 3m - 4 ).Given that Bruce does 38 push-ups, I'll substitute ( p ) with 38 in the equation to find ( m ). Solving for ( m ) will give me the number of minutes he spends meditating.Next, for the second part, Bruce's goal is to balance his training so that the product of the minutes spent meditating (( m )) and the number of push-ups (( p )) equals his lucky number, 108. Using the relationship from the first part, I'll substitute ( p ) in the product equation to create a quadratic equation in terms of ( m ). Solving this quadratic equation will provide the possible values for ( m ) that satisfy Bruce's goal."},{"question":"As a proud descendant of Carolingian warriors, you have discovered an ancient scroll that details the construction of a legendary fortress. The scroll reveals that the fortress was designed with two main towers, each representing the strength and strategic ingenuity of the Carolingian Empire. The height of the first tower is modeled by the polynomial ( h_1(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5 ), where ( x ) is a scaling factor representing the advancement of construction techniques over time. The height of the second tower is modeled by the polynomial ( h_2(x) = x^3 - x^2 + 2x + 1 ).1. Determine the polynomial that represents the total height of both towers combined. Simplify your answer.2. Using the combined height polynomial from part 1, find the value of ( x ) for which the total height of both towers is exactly 50 units. (Note: This will require solving a polynomial equation.)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two towers with their heights modeled by polynomials, and I need to find the total height when combined and then solve for x when the total height is 50 units. Let me try to work through this step by step.First, part 1 is asking for the polynomial that represents the total height of both towers combined. That sounds straightforward. I think I just need to add the two polynomials together, right? So, h1(x) is 2x³ - 3x² + x + 5, and h2(x) is x³ - x² + 2x + 1. So, adding them together should give me the total height.Let me write that out:h_total(x) = h1(x) + h2(x)= (2x³ - 3x² + x + 5) + (x³ - x² + 2x + 1)Now, I need to combine like terms. Let's see:For the x³ terms: 2x³ + x³ = 3x³For the x² terms: -3x² - x² = -4x²For the x terms: x + 2x = 3xFor the constant terms: 5 + 1 = 6So putting it all together, the total height polynomial is:h_total(x) = 3x³ - 4x² + 3x + 6Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check by adding each term again:2x³ + x³ is 3x³, correct.-3x² - x² is -4x², yes.x + 2x is 3x, that's right.5 + 1 is 6, perfect.Okay, so part 1 is done. The total height polynomial is 3x³ - 4x² + 3x + 6.Now, moving on to part 2. I need to find the value of x for which the total height is exactly 50 units. So, I need to solve the equation:3x³ - 4x² + 3x + 6 = 50Let me rewrite that equation:3x³ - 4x² + 3x + 6 - 50 = 0Simplify the constants:6 - 50 is -44, so:3x³ - 4x² + 3x - 44 = 0Alright, now I have a cubic equation: 3x³ - 4x² + 3x - 44 = 0. I need to find the real roots of this equation. Since it's a cubic, there could be up to three real roots, but I'm probably looking for a positive real root since x is a scaling factor representing advancement over time, so negative values might not make sense here.Let me think about how to solve this. I can try rational root theorem first to see if there are any rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient.The constant term is -44, so its factors are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±11, ±22, ±44.The leading coefficient is 3, so factors are ±1, ±3.Therefore, possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±11, ±22, ±44, ±1/3, ±2/3, ±4/3, ±11/3, ±22/3, ±44/3.I can test these values one by one by plugging them into the equation to see if any of them satisfy it.Let me start with x=1:3(1)^3 - 4(1)^2 + 3(1) - 44 = 3 - 4 + 3 - 44 = (3 - 4) + (3 - 44) = (-1) + (-41) = -42 ≠ 0Not a root.x=2:3(8) - 4(4) + 3(2) - 44 = 24 - 16 + 6 - 44 = (24 - 16) + (6 - 44) = 8 - 38 = -30 ≠ 0Not a root.x=4:3(64) - 4(16) + 3(4) - 44 = 192 - 64 + 12 - 44 = (192 - 64) + (12 - 44) = 128 - 32 = 96 ≠ 0Not a root.x=11:That's probably too big, but let me check:3(1331) - 4(121) + 3(11) - 44 = 3993 - 484 + 33 - 443993 - 484 is 3509, 3509 + 33 is 3542, 3542 - 44 is 3498 ≠ 0Way too big.x= -1:3(-1)^3 - 4(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 44 = -3 - 4 - 3 - 44 = -54 ≠ 0x= -2:3(-8) - 4(4) + 3(-2) - 44 = -24 -16 -6 -44 = -90 ≠ 0x=1/3:3*(1/27) - 4*(1/9) + 3*(1/3) - 44= 1/9 - 4/9 + 1 - 44= (-3/9) + (-43) = (-1/3) - 43 = -43.333... ≠ 0x=2/3:3*(8/27) - 4*(4/9) + 3*(2/3) - 44= 24/27 - 16/9 + 2 - 44Simplify:24/27 is 8/9, 16/9 is 16/9, 2 is 2, 44 is 44.So, 8/9 - 16/9 + 2 - 44 = (-8/9) + (-42) = -42.888... ≠ 0x=4/3:3*(64/27) - 4*(16/9) + 3*(4/3) - 44= 192/27 - 64/9 + 4 - 44Simplify:192/27 is 64/9, 64/9 - 64/9 is 0, 4 - 44 is -40 ≠ 0x=11/3:3*(1331/27) - 4*(121/9) + 3*(11/3) - 44= 3993/27 - 484/9 + 33/3 - 44Simplify:3993/27 is 148.222..., 484/9 is approximately 53.777..., 33/3 is 11.So, 148.222 - 53.777 + 11 - 44 ≈ 148.222 - 53.777 is 94.445, plus 11 is 105.445, minus 44 is 61.445 ≠ 0Hmm, none of these are working. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations? Let me double-check x=2:3*(8) =24, -4*(4)= -16, +3*(2)=6, -44.24 -16=8, 8 +6=14, 14 -44= -30. Yeah, that's correct.x=3:Wait, I didn't test x=3.

Maybe this cubic doesn't have any rational roots, or perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.Alternatively, maybe I should try to factor this cubic or use the rational root theorem differently. Wait, perhaps I can use synthetic division to test some roots.Alternatively, maybe I can graph the function or use numerical methods to approximate the root.But since this is a problem-solving scenario, perhaps I can use the Intermediate Value Theorem to approximate where the root lies.Let me evaluate h_total(x) at some points to see where it crosses 50.Wait, actually, h_total(x) is 3x³ -4x² +3x +6, and we set it equal to 50, so 3x³ -4x² +3x -44=0.Let me compute f(x)=3x³ -4x² +3x -44.Compute f(3)= 81 - 36 +9 -44=10f(4)= 192 - 64 +12 -44=96So between x=3 and x=4, f(x) goes from 10 to 96, so it's increasing. Since f(3)=10 and f(4)=96, and we're looking for f(x)=0, but wait, f(x) is positive at x=3 and x=4, but we need to find where f(x)=0.Wait, but f(2)= -30, f(3)=10, so between x=2 and x=3, f(x) goes from -30 to 10, so by Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root between 2 and 3.Similarly, let me check f(2.5):f(2.5)=3*(15.625) -4*(6.25) +3*(2.5) -44=46.875 -25 +7.5 -4446.875 -25=21.875, 21.875 +7.5=29.375, 29.375 -44= -14.625So f(2.5)= -14.625So between x=2.5 and x=3, f(x) goes from -14.625 to 10. So the root is between 2.5 and 3.Let me try x=2.75:f(2.75)=3*(2.75)^3 -4*(2.75)^2 +3*(2.75) -44First, compute 2.75^3:2.75^3 = (2 + 0.75)^3 = 8 + 3*(4)*(0.75) + 3*(2)*(0.75)^2 + (0.75)^3Wait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, 2.75*2.75=7.5625, then 7.5625*2.75.Let me compute 7.5625*2.75:7 * 2.75 = 19.250.5625 * 2.75: 0.5*2.75=1.375, 0.0625*2.75=0.171875, so total 1.375 + 0.171875=1.546875So total 19.25 +1.546875=20.796875So 2.75^3=20.796875Now, 3*(20.796875)=62.390625Next, 2.75^2=7.5625, so 4*(7.5625)=30.25Then, 3*(2.75)=8.25So putting it all together:62.390625 -30.25 +8.25 -44Compute step by step:62.390625 -30.25=32.14062532.140625 +8.25=40.39062540.390625 -44= -3.609375So f(2.75)= -3.609375So between x=2.75 and x=3, f(x) goes from -3.609 to 10. So the root is between 2.75 and 3.Let me try x=2.8:Compute f(2.8):First, 2.8^3=21.9523*(21.952)=65.8562.8^2=7.844*(7.84)=31.363*(2.8)=8.4So f(2.8)=65.856 -31.36 +8.4 -44Compute step by step:65.856 -31.36=34.49634.496 +8.4=42.89642.896 -44= -1.104So f(2.8)= -1.104Still negative.

Maybe I need more accurate calculations.Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll settle for x≈2.821.Alternatively, maybe I can use the cubic formula, but that's quite complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the cubic can be factored, but I don't see an easy way.Alternatively, maybe I can use the depressed cubic method.But given the time, I think it's acceptable to approximate the root as x≈2.821.So, to summarize:1. The total height polynomial is 3x³ -4x² +3x +6.2. The value of x for which the total height is 50 is approximately 2.821.But let me check if the cubic can be factored. Let me try to factor 3x³ -4x² +3x -44.Looking for factors, perhaps grouping:Group as (3x³ -4x²) + (3x -44)Factor out x² from first group: x²(3x -4) + (3x -44)Hmm, not helpful.Alternatively, maybe another grouping.Alternatively, perhaps factor by substitution.Alternatively, perhaps use the rational root theorem again, but I already tried all possible rational roots and none worked, so it's likely that the root is irrational.Therefore, the answer is approximately x≈2.821.But to express it more precisely, maybe I can write it as x≈2.821 or round to three decimal places as 2.821.Alternatively, since the problem says \\"find the value of x\\", it might expect an exact form, but since it's a cubic without rational roots, it's likely that the answer is expected to be approximate.So, I think I've done enough steps to approximate it to x≈2.821.**Final Answer**1.

Let me try to break this down step by step. First, the function is given as ( f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 3 ). I need to find the values of ( x ) where ( f(x) = 0 ). That means solving the equation ( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0 ). Hmm, solving a cubic equation.

It states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms ( frac{p}{q} ), has ( p ) as a factor of the constant term and ( q ) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -3, and the leading coefficient is 2. So the possible rational roots could be ( pm1, pm3, pmfrac{1}{2}, pmfrac{3}{2} ). I'll test these possible roots by plugging them into the function. Let's start with ( x = 1 ):( f(1) = 2(1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 4(1) - 3 = 2 - 5 + 4 - 3 = -2 ).

Not zero.How about ( x = frac{1}{2} ):( fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = 2left(frac{1}{8}right) - 5left(frac{1}{4}right) + 4left(frac{1}{2}right) - 3 = frac{1}{4} - frac{5}{4} + 2 - 3 = frac{1 - 5}{4} + (-1) = -1 -1 = -2 ). Still not zero.Let me try ( x = frac{3}{2} ):( fleft(frac{3}{2}right) = 2left(frac{27}{8}right) - 5left(frac{9}{4}right) + 4left(frac{3}{2}right) - 3 ).Calculating each term:- ( 2*(27/8) = 54/8 = 27/4 = 6.75 )- ( -5*(9/4) = -45/4 = -11.25 )- ( 4*(3/2) = 12/2 = 6 )- ( -3 )Adding them up: 6.75 - 11.25 + 6 - 3 = (6.75 - 11.25) + (6 - 3) = (-4.5) + 3 = -1.5. Not zero either.Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check ( x = 1 ) again. Wait, ( 2 - 5 + 4 - 3 = -2 ). Yeah, that's correct. Maybe I need to try another approach since none of the rational roots seem to work.Alternatively, perhaps I can factor by grouping. Let me see if that's possible. The polynomial is ( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 3 ). Let me group the first two terms and the last two terms:( (2x^3 - 5x^2) + (4x - 3) ).Factor out ( x^2 ) from the first group: ( x^2(2x - 5) + (4x - 3) ). Doesn't seem to factor nicely. Maybe another grouping? Let me try grouping differently: ( 2x^3 + 4x ) and ( -5x^2 - 3 ). Factor out 2x from the first group: ( 2x(x^2 + 2) ) and from the second group, factor out -1: ( -1(5x^2 + 3) ). Still not helpful.Hmm, maybe synthetic division isn't the way to go. Perhaps I should try to find one real root numerically and then factor it out. Alternatively, maybe I can use the cubic formula, but that seems complicated.Wait, another thought: maybe I made a mistake in calculating ( f(3/2) ). Let me recalculate that carefully.( fleft(frac{3}{2}right) = 2left(frac{3}{2}right)^3 - 5left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 + 4left(frac{3}{2}right) - 3 ).Calculating each term step by step:- ( left(frac{3}{2}right)^3 = frac{27}{8} )- ( 2 * frac{27}{8} = frac{54}{8} = frac{27}{4} = 6.75 )- ( left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 = frac{9}{4} )- ( -5 * frac{9}{4} = -frac{45}{4} = -11.25 )- ( 4 * frac{3}{2} = 6 )- ( -3 )Adding them up: 6.75 - 11.25 + 6 - 3 = (6.75 - 11.25) + (6 - 3) = (-4.5) + 3 = -1.5. Yep, still -1.5. So ( x = 3/2 ) isn't a root either.Maybe I should try ( x = 1.5 ) again, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the polynomial doesn't have rational roots, so I need to use another method.Wait, another idea: maybe I can use the Intermediate Value Theorem to approximate a real root. Let's evaluate the function at some points to see where it crosses zero.We know that ( f(1) = -2 ) and ( f(2) = 2(8) - 5(4) + 4(2) - 3 = 16 - 20 + 8 - 3 = 1. So between x=1 and x=2, the function goes from -2 to 1, so by IVT, there's a root between 1 and 2.Similarly, let's check ( f(0) = -3 ), ( f(1) = -2 ), so it's negative at both ends. Let's check ( f(-1) = 2(-1)^3 -5(-1)^2 +4(-1) -3 = -2 -5 -4 -3 = -14. Still negative.Wait, maybe there's only one real root and two complex roots? Let me check the derivative to see the behavior.The derivative ( f'(x) = 6x^2 -10x +4 ). Let's find critical points by setting ( f'(x) = 0 ):( 6x^2 -10x +4 = 0 )Using quadratic formula: ( x = [10 ± sqrt(100 - 96)] / 12 = [10 ± 2]/12 )So ( x = (10 + 2)/12 = 12/12 = 1 ) and ( x = (10 - 2)/12 = 8/12 = 2/3 ).So the function has critical points at x=2/3 and x=1. Let's evaluate f at these points to see if they are maxima or minima.At x=2/3:( f(2/3) = 2*(8/27) -5*(4/9) +4*(2/3) -3 )= 16/27 - 20/9 + 8/3 -3Convert to common denominator 27:= 16/27 - 60/27 + 72/27 -81/27= (16 -60 +72 -81)/27= (-44 +72 -81)/27= (28 -81)/27= -53/27 ≈ -1.96At x=1:( f(1) = -2 ) as before.So the function has a local maximum at x=2/3 of approximately -1.96 and a local minimum at x=1 of -2. Since both are negative, the function is increasing from x=1 onwards. Since f(2)=1, which is positive, there must be a root between x=1 and x=2.So, to find the real root, I can use methods like Newton-Raphson. Let's try that.Let me take an initial guess x0=1.5. f(1.5) we calculated earlier as -1.5. f'(1.5)=6*(2.25)-10*(1.5)+4=13.5-15+4=2.5.Newton-Raphson update: x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) = 1.5 - (-1.5)/2.5 = 1.5 + 0.6 = 2.1.Now, f(2.1)=2*(9.261) -5*(4.41) +4*(2.1) -3= 18.522 -22.05 +8.4 -3= (18.522 -22.05) + (8.4 -3)= (-3.528) + 5.4= 1.872f'(2.1)=6*(4.41) -10*(2.1) +4=26.46 -21 +4=9.46Next iteration: x2 = 2.1 - 1.872/9.46 ≈ 2.1 - 0.1977 ≈ 1.9023Now, f(1.9023)=2*(1.9023)^3 -5*(1.9023)^2 +4*(1.9023) -3Calculating each term:- (1.9023)^3 ≈ 6.874- 2*6.874 ≈13.748- (1.9023)^2 ≈3.618- -5*3.618≈-18.09- 4*1.9023≈7.609- -3Adding up:13.748 -18.09 +7.609 -3 ≈ (13.748 -18.09) + (7.609 -3) ≈ (-4.342) +4.609≈0.267f'(1.9023)=6*(1.9023)^2 -10*(1.9023) +4≈6*3.618 -19.023 +4≈21.708 -19.023 +4≈6.685Next iteration: x3 =1.9023 -0.267/6.685≈1.9023 -0.04≈1.8623Now, f(1.8623)=2*(1.8623)^3 -5*(1.8623)^2 +4*(1.8623) -3Calculating:- (1.8623)^3≈6.43- 2*6.43≈12.86- (1.8623)^2≈3.467- -5*3.467≈-17.335- 4*1.8623≈7.449- -3Adding up:12.86 -17.335 +7.449 -3≈(12.86 -17.335)+(7.449 -3)≈(-4.475)+4.449≈-0.026f'(1.8623)=6*(3.467) -10*(1.8623)+4≈20.802 -18.623 +4≈6.179Next iteration: x4=1.8623 - (-0.026)/6.179≈1.8623 +0.0042≈1.8665Now, f(1.8665)=2*(1.8665)^3 -5*(1.8665)^2 +4*(1.8665) -3Calculating:- (1.8665)^3≈6.51- 2*6.51≈13.02- (1.8665)^2≈3.482- -5*3.482≈-17.41- 4*1.8665≈7.466- -3Adding up:13.02 -17.41 +7.466 -3≈(13.02 -17.41)+(7.466 -3)≈(-4.39)+4.466≈0.076Wait, that's positive. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.

So the real root is approximately x≈1.861.Since it's a cubic, there are two other roots, which could be complex or real. Given the behavior of the function, since it approaches -∞ as x→-∞ and +∞ as x→+∞, and we have only one real root found so far, the other two must be complex conjugates.So, the real root is approximately x≈1.861, and the other two roots are complex.Now, moving on to the second part: solving the inequality ( 2x^3 -5x^2 +4x -3 < 0 ).Since we have a cubic with leading coefficient positive, the graph will go from -∞ to +∞. We know there's only one real root at x≈1.861. The function is negative before this root and positive after, but wait, let me think.Wait, actually, the behavior depends on the multiplicity of the roots. Since we have one real root and two complex roots, the function will cross the x-axis only once. So, the function will be negative for x < 1.861 and positive for x >1.861.But wait, let me check the sign changes. Let's pick a test point less than 1.861, say x=1. f(1)=-2 <0. Then pick a point greater than 1.861, say x=2. f(2)=1 >0. So yes, the function is negative for x <1.861 and positive for x>1.861.Therefore, the inequality ( 2x^3 -5x^2 +4x -3 < 0 ) holds for x <1.861.But wait, let me confirm by checking another point. Let's take x=0: f(0)=-3 <0. x=3: f(3)=18 >0. So yes, the function is negative to the left of the real root and positive to the right.Therefore, the solution to the inequality is all real numbers less than approximately 1.861.But since we're dealing with an algorithm, perhaps we need an exact form or a more precise interval. However, since the real root is irrational, we can express it in terms of the root or use the approximate value.Alternatively, if we can factor the polynomial, we might express it more neatly, but since we couldn't find rational roots, factoring isn't straightforward.So, summarizing:1. The real root is approximately x≈1.861, and the other two roots are complex.2. The inequality ( f(x) <0 ) holds for x <1.861.But wait, let me think again. Since the function is a cubic with positive leading coefficient, it tends to -∞ as x→-∞ and +∞ as x→+∞. So, it must cross the x-axis once. Therefore, the function is negative before the real root and positive after.Hence, the solution to the inequality is x < real root.But to express it more precisely, perhaps we can write it in terms of the exact root, but since it's irrational, we can leave it as x < c, where c is the real root.Alternatively, if we can express c in exact form, but that would require solving the cubic exactly, which is more complex.So, in conclusion, the roots are one real root at approximately x≈1.861 and two complex roots. The inequality holds for x <1.861.**Final Answer**The roots of the polynomial are approximately ( x approx 1.861 ) and two complex roots. The inequality ( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 3 < 0 ) holds for all real numbers less than this root. Thus, the solution is:For the roots: (boxed{x approx 1.861}) (and two complex roots).For the inequality: (boxed{x < 1.861})."},{"question":"A local historian from Muxía, Galicia, is working on restoring an old clock tower in the town square. The clock mechanism is powered by a weight that descends down the tower, and the historian is trying to calculate the descent time of the weight to ensure the clock runs accurately. The clock's weight descends according to the polynomial function ( h(t) = -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 15 ), where ( h(t) ) is the height of the weight above the ground in meters, and ( t ) is the time in seconds after the weight starts descending.1. The historian needs to determine the time ( t ) when the weight reaches a height of 5 meters. Solve the equation ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 15 = 5 ) for ( t ).2. Additionally, due to recent historical research, it was found that the clock's weight mechanism originally operated such that the height function had a constant term of 10 meters instead of 15 meters. Simplify the expression ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 10 ) and determine any changes in the characteristics of its roots compared to the original polynomial.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a clock tower in Muxía, Galicia. The historian is trying to figure out when the weight reaches 5 meters, and also looking into an old version of the height function. Let me try to tackle these step by step.Starting with the first part: solving the equation ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 15 = 5 ). Hmm, okay, so I need to find the time ( t ) when the height ( h(t) ) is 5 meters. That means I have to solve for ( t ) in the equation:( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 15 = 5 )First, I should subtract 5 from both sides to set the equation to zero. Let me write that down:( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 15 - 5 = 0 )Simplifying that:( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 10 = 0 )So now I have the equation ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 10 = 0 ). Hmm, this is a cubic equation. Solving cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.I remember the Rational Root Theorem, which says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms ( frac{p}{q} ), has ( p ) as a factor of the constant term and ( q ) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is 10, and the leading coefficient is -2.So possible values for ( p ) are ±1, ±2, ±5, ±10, and possible values for ( q ) are ±1, ±2. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±5, ±10, ±1/2, ±5/2.Let me test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation.Starting with ( t = 1 ):( -2(1)^3 + 12(1)^2 - 20(1) + 10 = -2 + 12 - 20 + 10 = 0 )Oh, that works! So ( t = 1 ) is a root. That means ( (t - 1) ) is a factor of the polynomial.Now, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out ( (t - 1) ) from the cubic equation.Let me set up synthetic division with root 1:Coefficients: -2, 12, -20, 10Bring down the -2.Multiply -2 by 1: -2. Add to next coefficient: 12 + (-2) = 10.Multiply 10 by 1: 10. Add to next coefficient: -20 + 10 = -10.Multiply -10 by 1: -10. Add to last coefficient: 10 + (-10) = 0. Perfect, no remainder.So, the cubic polynomial factors into ( (t - 1)(-2t^2 + 10t - 10) ).So now, we have:( (t - 1)(-2t^2 + 10t - 10) = 0 )We can factor out a -2 from the quadratic:( (t - 1)(-2)(t^2 - 5t + 5) = 0 )So, the equation becomes:( -2(t - 1)(t^2 - 5t + 5) = 0 )Setting each factor equal to zero:1. ( t - 1 = 0 ) → ( t = 1 )2. ( t^2 - 5t + 5 = 0 )Let me solve the quadratic equation ( t^2 - 5t + 5 = 0 ) using the quadratic formula:( t = frac{5 pm sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(5)}}{2(1)} = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 - 20}}{2} = frac{5 pm sqrt{5}}{2} )So, the roots are:( t = frac{5 + sqrt{5}}{2} ) and ( t = frac{5 - sqrt{5}}{2} )Calculating these numerically:( sqrt{5} ) is approximately 2.236.So,( t = frac{5 + 2.236}{2} = frac{7.236}{2} ≈ 3.618 ) secondsand( t = frac{5 - 2.236}{2} = frac{2.764}{2} ≈ 1.382 ) secondsSo, the equation ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 10 = 0 ) has three real roots: ( t = 1 ), ( t ≈ 1.382 ), and ( t ≈ 3.618 ).But wait, let's think about the context. The weight is descending, so the height starts at 15 meters when ( t = 0 ) and goes down. So, the height function ( h(t) = -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 15 ) is a cubic that starts high and goes down.We need to find when it reaches 5 meters. So, the times when ( h(t) = 5 ) are the solutions we found: 1, approximately 1.382, and approximately 3.618 seconds.But wait, let's check the behavior of the function. Since it's a cubic with a negative leading coefficient, as ( t ) approaches infinity, ( h(t) ) approaches negative infinity. So, the function will cross the height of 5 meters three times: once on the way down, then maybe it goes back up, and then down again? Hmm, but in reality, the weight is descending, so it should only cross each height once. Maybe I need to analyze the function more carefully.Wait, perhaps the function isn't strictly decreasing. Let me find the derivative to check the critical points.The derivative ( h'(t) = -6t^2 + 24t - 20 )Set derivative equal to zero to find critical points:( -6t^2 + 24t - 20 = 0 )Multiply both sides by -1:( 6t^2 - 24t + 20 = 0 )Divide by 2:( 3t^2 - 12t + 10 = 0 )Quadratic formula:( t = frac{12 pm sqrt{144 - 120}}{6} = frac{12 pm sqrt{24}}{6} = frac{12 pm 2sqrt{6}}{6} = frac{6 pm sqrt{6}}{3} = 2 pm frac{sqrt{6}}{3} )Approximately, ( sqrt{6} ≈ 2.449 ), so:( t ≈ 2 + 0.816 ≈ 2.816 ) and ( t ≈ 2 - 0.816 ≈ 1.184 )So, the function has critical points at approximately 1.184 and 2.816 seconds. Let me check the second derivative to see if they are maxima or minima.Second derivative ( h''(t) = -12t + 24 )At ( t ≈ 1.184 ):( h''(1.184) = -12(1.184) + 24 ≈ -14.208 + 24 ≈ 9.792 ), which is positive, so it's a local minimum.At ( t ≈ 2.816 ):( h''(2.816) = -12(2.816) + 24 ≈ -33.792 + 24 ≈ -9.792 ), which is negative, so it's a local maximum.Wait, that seems a bit odd. So, the function starts at 15 meters, goes down, reaches a local minimum at around 1.184 seconds, then goes up to a local maximum at around 2.816 seconds, and then goes down again.So, the height of 5 meters is crossed three times: once on the initial descent before the local minimum, then again on the way up to the local maximum, and then again on the way down after the local maximum.But in the context of the problem, the weight is descending, so maybe the clock mechanism only operates during the initial descent? Or perhaps after the local maximum, it's still part of the mechanism.Wait, but if the weight goes up after the local minimum, that would mean it's ascending, which contradicts the idea of a descending weight. So, perhaps the clock mechanism is designed such that the weight only descends until it reaches the ground, but in this case, the function suggests it goes up again. Hmm, maybe the model isn't perfect, or perhaps the clock has some mechanism to reset the weight.But for the purpose of this problem, I think we just need to find all times when the height is 5 meters, regardless of the direction of motion.So, the solutions are at approximately 1 second, 1.382 seconds, and 3.618 seconds.But let's verify these solutions by plugging them back into the original equation.First, ( t = 1 ):( h(1) = -2(1)^3 + 12(1)^2 - 20(1) + 15 = -2 + 12 - 20 + 15 = 5 ). Correct.Next, ( t ≈ 1.382 ):Let me compute ( h(1.382) ):First, ( t^3 ≈ (1.382)^3 ≈ 2.63 )( -2t^3 ≈ -5.26 )( 12t^2 ≈ 12*(1.91) ≈ 22.92 )( -20t ≈ -27.64 )Adding up: -5.26 + 22.92 -27.64 +15 ≈ (-5.26 -27.64) + (22.92 +15) ≈ (-32.9) + 37.92 ≈ 5.02. Close enough, considering rounding.Similarly, ( t ≈ 3.618 ):( t^3 ≈ (3.618)^3 ≈ 47.4 )( -2t^3 ≈ -94.8 )( 12t^2 ≈ 12*(13.09) ≈ 157.08 )( -20t ≈ -72.36 )Adding up: -94.8 + 157.08 -72.36 +15 ≈ (-94.8 -72.36) + (157.08 +15) ≈ (-167.16) + 172.08 ≈ 4.92. Again, close enough.So, all three times are valid.But in the context of the problem, the weight is descending, so perhaps the first time it reaches 5 meters is at t=1 second, then it goes back up, reaching 5 meters again on the way up at t≈1.382, and then finally descending past 5 meters again at t≈3.618. So, depending on how the clock operates, maybe all three times are relevant? Or perhaps only the first and the last? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, so I think we just need to provide all solutions.So, the times when the weight is at 5 meters are t=1, t≈1.382, and t≈3.618 seconds.Moving on to the second part: the original height function had a constant term of 10 meters instead of 15. So, the new polynomial is ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 10 ). The problem asks to simplify this expression and determine any changes in the characteristics of its roots compared to the original polynomial.Wait, but we already simplified it earlier when solving the first part. The original polynomial was ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 15 ), and when we set it equal to 5, we got ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 10 = 0 ). So, the new polynomial is just the original polynomial shifted down by 5 meters.But the problem says the original height function had a constant term of 10 instead of 15. So, the new polynomial is ( h(t) = -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 10 ). The question is to simplify this expression and determine any changes in the characteristics of its roots compared to the original.Wait, but the expression is already simplified. Maybe they mean factor it or analyze its roots? Let me see.We can factor it as we did before. Let me try to factor ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 10 ).Again, using the Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±5, ±10, ±1/2, ±5/2.Testing ( t=1 ):( -2(1)^3 + 12(1)^2 - 20(1) + 10 = -2 + 12 -20 +10 = 0 ). So, t=1 is a root.Using synthetic division:Coefficients: -2, 12, -20, 10Bring down -2.Multiply by 1: -2. Add to 12: 10.Multiply by 1: 10. Add to -20: -10.Multiply by 1: -10. Add to 10: 0.So, factors to ( (t - 1)(-2t^2 + 10t -10) ). Factor out -2: ( -2(t -1)(t^2 -5t +5) ). So, same as before.So, the roots are t=1, and ( t = [5 ± sqrt(5)]/2 ). So, same roots as the equation we solved in part 1.Wait, but in part 1, we were solving ( h(t) = 5 ), which led us to the equation ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t +10 =0 ). So, the roots are the same as the roots of the new polynomial ( h(t) = -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t +10 ).Wait, but in the original polynomial, ( h(t) = -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t +15 ), the roots are when h(t)=0, which would be different. But in this case, the new polynomial is ( h(t) = -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t +10 ), so its roots are when h(t)=0, which are the same as the solutions to ( h(t)=5 ) in the original polynomial.So, the roots of the new polynomial are the same as the solutions to ( h(t)=5 ) in the original polynomial. Therefore, the roots are t=1, t≈1.382, and t≈3.618.Comparing this to the original polynomial ( h(t) = -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t +15 ), which has roots when h(t)=0. Let me find those roots.Set ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t +15 =0 ). Let me try to factor this.Again, possible rational roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±15, ±1/2, ±3/2, etc.Testing t=1:( -2 +12 -20 +15 =5 ≠0 )t=3:( -54 + 108 -60 +15 = (-54 -60) + (108 +15) = (-114) + 123 =9 ≠0t=5:( -250 + 300 -100 +15 = (-250 -100) + (300 +15) = (-350) + 315 = -35 ≠0t=1/2:( -2*(1/8) +12*(1/4) -20*(1/2) +15 = -0.25 +3 -10 +15 = (-0.25 -10) + (3 +15) = (-10.25) +18=7.75≠0t=3/2:( -2*(27/8) +12*(9/4) -20*(3/2) +15 = -6.75 +27 -30 +15 = (-6.75 -30) + (27 +15) = (-36.75) +42=5.25≠0t=5/2:( -2*(125/8) +12*(25/4) -20*(5/2) +15 = -31.25 +75 -50 +15 = (-31.25 -50) + (75 +15) = (-81.25) +90=8.75≠0Hmm, none of these are roots. Maybe it doesn't factor nicely, or perhaps it has irrational roots.Alternatively, maybe using the same approach as before, but it's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the original polynomial ( h(t) = -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t +15 ) doesn't have real roots, or has different roots.Wait, let me check the behavior of the original polynomial.At t=0, h(0)=15.As t approaches infinity, h(t) approaches negative infinity.So, it must cross the t-axis at least once. Let me check h(4):( h(4) = -2*(64) +12*(16) -20*(4) +15 = -128 +192 -80 +15 = (-128 -80) + (192 +15) = (-208) +207= -1So, h(4)= -1. So, between t=3 and t=4, h(t) goes from h(3)= -2*27 +12*9 -20*3 +15= -54 +108 -60 +15=9, and h(4)= -1. So, it crosses zero between t=3 and t=4.Similarly, h(2)= -16 +48 -40 +15=7h(1)=5h(0)=15So, the original polynomial h(t)=0 has one real root between 3 and 4, and possibly two complex roots or two more real roots.Wait, but since it's a cubic, it must have three real roots or one real and two complex conjugate roots.Given that the derivative has two real critical points, as we saw earlier, the function has a local maximum and a local minimum. So, if the local minimum is above zero, then the function only crosses the t-axis once. If the local minimum is below zero, then it crosses three times.Wait, let's compute the local minimum. The critical points were at t≈1.184 and t≈2.816.Compute h(1.184):First, t≈1.184Compute h(t)= -2t³ +12t² -20t +15t³≈1.658-2t³≈-3.31612t²≈12*(1.402)≈16.824-20t≈-23.68So, total≈-3.316 +16.824 -23.68 +15≈(-3.316 -23.68) + (16.824 +15)≈(-26.996) +31.824≈4.828So, h(t) at local minimum is approximately 4.828 meters, which is above zero.Similarly, compute h(t) at local maximum, t≈2.816:t≈2.816t²≈7.927t³≈22.33-2t³≈-44.6612t²≈95.124-20t≈-56.32So, total≈-44.66 +95.124 -56.32 +15≈(-44.66 -56.32) + (95.124 +15)≈(-100.98) +110.124≈9.144So, the local maximum is at around 9.144 meters.Therefore, the original polynomial h(t)= -2t³ +12t² -20t +15 has a local minimum at around 4.828 meters and a local maximum at around 9.144 meters. Since the local minimum is above zero, the function only crosses the t-axis once, somewhere after t=3 seconds.Therefore, the original polynomial has one real root and two complex conjugate roots.In contrast, the new polynomial ( h(t) = -2t³ +12t² -20t +10 ) has three real roots: t=1, t≈1.382, and t≈3.618.So, the change in the constant term from 15 to 10 meters has shifted the graph down by 5 meters, causing the polynomial to cross the t-axis three times instead of once. Therefore, the new polynomial has three real roots, while the original had only one real root and two complex roots.Additionally, the roots of the new polynomial are the times when the original weight would have been at 5 meters. So, the new polynomial's roots correspond to the solutions of the original equation set to 5 meters.In summary, changing the constant term from 15 to 10 meters shifts the entire graph downward, resulting in three real roots instead of one, and these roots represent the times when the weight would have been at 5 meters in the original setup.**Final Answer**1. The times when the weight reaches 5 meters are ( boxed{1} ) second, ( boxed{frac{5 - sqrt{5}}{2}} ) seconds, and ( boxed{frac{5 + sqrt{5}}{2}} ) seconds.2. The polynomial ( -2t^3 + 12t^2 - 20t + 10 ) has three real roots, whereas the original polynomial had one real root and two complex roots. The roots of the new polynomial are the times when the original weight would have been at 5 meters."},{"question":"The director of a competing educational institute is attempting to assess the potential financial impact of a proposed tie-up between two other educational institutes. To undermine the proposal, he claims that the expected profit margin is exaggerated. The proposed tie-up predicts that the revenue, R (in thousands of dollars), can be modeled by the polynomial function R(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x - 20, where x represents the number of students enrolled (in hundreds). The cost, C (in thousands of dollars), associated with the tie-up is given by C(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 9.1. Calculate the number of students enrolled, x, that would result in the revenue being equal to the cost. Solve the equation R(x) = C(x) to find the value(s) of x.2. The director argues that even if the enrollment were to increase to 300 students, the profit margin (revenue minus cost) would not exceed 10,000. Formulate and solve an inequality to determine if the director’s claim is valid for x = 3.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about two educational institutes considering a tie-up, and their director is trying to assess the financial impact. The director thinks the expected profit margin is exaggerated, so he's making some claims. I need to help figure out if he's right by solving two parts.First, part 1: I need to find the number of students enrolled, x, where the revenue equals the cost. That means solving R(x) = C(x). The revenue function is given by R(x) = x³ - 4x² + 10x - 20, and the cost function is C(x) = 2x² - 5x + 9. So, I need to set these equal to each other and solve for x.Let me write that equation out:x³ - 4x² + 10x - 20 = 2x² - 5x + 9Hmm, okay. To solve this, I should bring all terms to one side so that I have a polynomial equal to zero. Let me subtract 2x² - 5x + 9 from both sides:x³ - 4x² + 10x - 20 - (2x² - 5x + 9) = 0Simplify that:x³ - 4x² + 10x - 20 - 2x² + 5x - 9 = 0Combine like terms:x³ + (-4x² - 2x²) + (10x + 5x) + (-20 - 9) = 0So that's:x³ - 6x² + 15x - 29 = 0Alright, so now I have a cubic equation: x³ - 6x² + 15x - 29 = 0. I need to find the real roots of this equation because x represents the number of students in hundreds, so it should be a positive real number.Cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor this or use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible roots. The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, p/q, is a factor of the constant term over a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -29 and the leading coefficient is 1, so possible rational roots are ±1, ±29.Let me test x=1:1 - 6 + 15 - 29 = (1 - 6) + (15 - 29) = (-5) + (-14) = -19 ≠ 0Not a root.x= -1:-1 - 6 - 15 - 29 = (-1 -6) + (-15 -29) = (-7) + (-44) = -51 ≠ 0Not a root.x=29:That's a big number, but let's see:29³ - 6*(29)² + 15*29 - 2929³ is 24,3896*(29)² is 6*841 = 5,04615*29 is 435So, 24,389 - 5,046 + 435 -2924,389 - 5,046 is 19,34319,343 + 435 is 19,77819,778 -29 is 19,749 ≠ 0Not a root.x= -29 is obviously negative, which doesn't make sense in this context, so we can ignore that.Hmm, so no rational roots. Maybe I need to use another method. Since it's a cubic, I can try factoring by grouping, but I don't see an obvious way. Alternatively, maybe I can use the cubic formula, but that's complicated. Alternatively, I can use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.Wait, maybe I can analyze the function f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 15x - 29 to see where it crosses zero.Let me compute f(3):3³ - 6*(3)² + 15*3 -29 = 27 - 54 + 45 -29 = (27 -54) + (45 -29) = (-27) + 16 = -11f(3) = -11f(4):64 - 6*16 + 60 -29 = 64 -96 + 60 -29 = (64 -96) + (60 -29) = (-32) + 31 = -1f(4) = -1f(5):125 - 6*25 + 75 -29 = 125 -150 + 75 -29 = (125 -150) + (75 -29) = (-25) + 46 = 21f(5) = 21So between x=4 and x=5, the function goes from -1 to 21, so it crosses zero somewhere there. So, there's a real root between 4 and 5.Wait, but the question is about the number of students, x, in hundreds. So, x=4 would be 400 students, x=5 is 500 students. But the director is talking about x=3, which is 300 students in part 2.But in part 1, we need to find x where R(x)=C(x). So, the real root is between 4 and 5. Let's see if we can approximate it.Let me compute f(4.5):4.5³ - 6*(4.5)² + 15*4.5 -294.5³ = 91.1256*(4.5)² = 6*20.25 = 121.515*4.5 = 67.5So, 91.125 - 121.5 + 67.5 -29Compute step by step:91.125 - 121.5 = -30.375-30.375 + 67.5 = 37.12537.125 -29 = 8.125f(4.5) = 8.125So, f(4.5) is positive, while f(4) is -1. So, the root is between 4 and 4.5.Let me try f(4.25):4.25³ = 76.7656256*(4.25)² = 6*(18.0625) = 108.37515*4.25 = 63.75So, 76.765625 - 108.375 + 63.75 -29Compute step by step:76.765625 - 108.375 = -31.609375-31.609375 + 63.75 = 32.14062532.140625 -29 = 3.140625f(4.25) ≈ 3.14Still positive. So, the root is between 4 and 4.25.Let me try f(4.1):4.1³ = 68.9216*(4.1)² = 6*16.81 = 100.8615*4.1 = 61.5So, 68.921 - 100.86 + 61.5 -29Compute:68.921 -100.86 = -31.939-31.939 + 61.5 = 29.56129.561 -29 = 0.561f(4.1) ≈ 0.561Almost zero. So, f(4.1) ≈ 0.561, which is close to zero.Let me try f(4.05):4.05³ ≈ 4.05*4.05*4.05. 4.05*4.05 = 16.4025, then 16.4025*4.05 ≈ 66.4301256*(4.05)² = 6*(16.4025) ≈ 98.41515*4.05 = 60.75So, 66.430125 - 98.415 + 60.75 -29Compute:66.430125 -98.415 ≈ -31.984875-31.984875 + 60.75 ≈ 28.76512528.765125 -29 ≈ -0.234875So, f(4.05) ≈ -0.2349So, f(4.05) is approximately -0.2349 and f(4.1) is approximately 0.561. So, the root is between 4.05 and 4.1.To approximate, let's use linear approximation.Between x=4.05 (f=-0.2349) and x=4.1 (f=0.561). The change in x is 0.05, and the change in f is 0.561 - (-0.2349) = 0.7959.We want to find x where f(x)=0.So, starting at x=4.05, f=-0.2349.We need to cover 0.2349 to reach zero.The rate is 0.7959 per 0.05 x.So, delta_x = (0.2349 / 0.7959) * 0.05 ≈ (0.295) * 0.05 ≈ 0.01475So, approximate root is 4.05 + 0.01475 ≈ 4.06475So, approximately 4.065.So, x ≈ 4.065.But since x is in hundreds of students, that would be approximately 406.5 students.But the question is to calculate the number of students enrolled, x, that would result in revenue equal to cost. So, x ≈ 4.065, which is approximately 4.07 when rounded to two decimal places.But since the number of students can't be a fraction, but in this context, x is in hundreds, so 4.07 would be 407 students.But the question didn't specify whether to round or give an exact value. Since it's a cubic, and we can't express it in exact form easily, probably we can leave it as a decimal or use a fraction.But maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check my calculations.Wait, when I calculated f(4.1):4.1³ = 68.9216*(4.1)² = 6*16.81 = 100.8615*4.1 = 61.5So, 68.921 - 100.86 + 61.5 -2968.921 -100.86 = -31.939-31.939 +61.5 = 29.56129.561 -29 = 0.561Yes, that's correct.Similarly, f(4.05):4.05³ ≈ 66.4301256*(4.05)² ≈ 98.41515*4.05 = 60.75So, 66.430125 -98.415 +60.75 -29 ≈ -31.984875 +60.75 -29 ≈ 28.765125 -29 ≈ -0.234875Yes, correct.So, the root is approximately 4.065. So, x ≈ 4.065.But let me check if the cubic can be factored or if I can find an exact root.Alternatively, maybe I can write it as:x³ - 6x² + 15x -29 = 0Let me see if I can factor this.Alternatively, maybe using the depressed cubic formula.But that might be too involved. Alternatively, since it's a cubic, it must have at least one real root, which we found approximately.Alternatively, maybe the equation can be rewritten.Wait, let me see:x³ -6x² +15x -29 =0Let me try to write it as:x³ -6x² +15x -29 =0I can try to see if it can be expressed as (x - a)(x² + bx + c) =0Expanding, we get x³ + (b -a)x² + (c -ab)x -ac =0Comparing coefficients:b - a = -6c - ab =15-ac = -29 => ac=29So, we have:From ac=29, since 29 is prime, a and c are either 1 and 29 or -1 and -29.Let me try a=1:Then c=29From b - a = -6 => b -1 = -6 => b= -5Then c -ab =29 - (1)(-5)=29 +5=34 ≠15. Not matching.Try a=29:c=1From b -29 = -6 => b=23Then c -ab =1 -29*23=1 -667= -666 ≠15. Not matching.Try a=-1:c=-29From b - (-1)=b +1 = -6 => b= -7Then c -ab= -29 - (-1)(-7)= -29 -7= -36 ≠15. Not matching.a=-29:c=-1From b - (-29)=b +29 = -6 => b= -35Then c -ab= -1 - (-29)(-35)= -1 -1015= -1016 ≠15. Not matching.So, no rational roots, as we saw earlier. So, the cubic doesn't factor nicely, so we have to rely on numerical methods.So, the approximate solution is x≈4.065.Since x is in hundreds, that's approximately 406.5 students.But since you can't have half a student, maybe they round to 407 students.But the question just says \\"the number of students enrolled, x\\", so maybe just present it as approximately 4.07 or 4.065.Alternatively, maybe the exact value can be expressed using the cubic formula, but that would be complicated.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.Wait, let me double-check:R(x) = x³ -4x² +10x -20C(x)=2x² -5x +9Set equal:x³ -4x² +10x -20 = 2x² -5x +9Bring all terms to left:x³ -4x² +10x -20 -2x² +5x -9 =0Combine like terms:x³ + (-4x² -2x²) + (10x +5x) + (-20 -9)=0So, x³ -6x² +15x -29=0Yes, that's correct.So, the equation is correct, and the approximate root is around 4.065.So, for part 1, the number of students is approximately 4.07, which is 407 students.But let me check if the question wants the exact value or an approximate.It says \\"calculate the number of students enrolled, x, that would result in the revenue being equal to the cost.\\"So, probably, since it's a cubic, we can't express it in exact form without radicals, so we have to approximate.So, x≈4.07.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact value, but since it's a cubic, unless it factors, which it doesn't, we have to approximate.So, moving on to part 2.The director argues that even if enrollment increases to 300 students, the profit margin (revenue minus cost) would not exceed 10,000. We need to check if this claim is valid for x=3.Wait, x represents the number of students in hundreds, so x=3 is 300 students.Profit P(x) = R(x) - C(x)So, we need to compute P(3) and see if it's less than or equal to 10 (since the profit is in thousands of dollars, so 10,000 is 10 thousand dollars).So, compute P(3) = R(3) - C(3)First, compute R(3):R(3) = 3³ -4*(3)² +10*3 -20 = 27 - 36 +30 -20Compute step by step:27 -36 = -9-9 +30 =2121 -20=1So, R(3)=1 (thousand dollars)Compute C(3):C(3)=2*(3)² -5*3 +9= 2*9 -15 +9=18 -15 +9=12So, C(3)=12 (thousand dollars)Thus, P(3)=R(3)-C(3)=1 -12= -11 (thousand dollars)So, the profit is negative, -11 thousand dollars, which is a loss of 11,000.So, the director is saying that even at 300 students, the profit won't exceed 10,000. But in reality, at x=3, the profit is negative, a loss of 11,000, which is way below 10,000.Wait, but the director is arguing that the profit margin would not exceed 10,000, which is true because it's actually a loss. So, the director's claim is valid because the profit is negative, which is certainly not exceeding 10,000.But let me double-check my calculations.Compute R(3):3³=27-4*(3)²= -4*9= -3610*3=30-20So, 27 -36 +30 -20= (27 -36)= -9; (-9 +30)=21; (21 -20)=1. Correct.C(3):2*(3)²=2*9=18-5*3= -15+9So, 18 -15 +9= (18 -15)=3; (3 +9)=12. Correct.Thus, P(3)=1 -12= -11. So, -11 thousand dollars.So, the profit is negative, so it's definitely not exceeding 10,000. Therefore, the director's claim is valid.But wait, the director is trying to undermine the proposal by saying the profit margin is exaggerated. So, if at x=3, the profit is negative, that supports his claim that the expected profit is exaggerated.So, in part 2, we need to formulate and solve an inequality to determine if the director’s claim is valid for x=3.The claim is that the profit margin would not exceed 10,000, which is 10 thousand dollars. So, we need to check if P(x) ≤10 when x=3.But since P(3)= -11, which is less than 10, the inequality holds. Therefore, the director's claim is valid.Alternatively, maybe the director is saying that the profit won't exceed 10,000, but in reality, at x=3, it's a loss, so the profit is negative, which is way below 10,000. So, the claim is valid.So, summarizing:1. Solve R(x)=C(x): x≈4.07 (hundreds of students, so ~407 students)2. At x=3 (300 students), the profit is -11 thousand dollars, which is less than 10 thousand, so the director's claim is valid.But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret part 2.The director argues that even if enrollment increases to 300 students, the profit margin would not exceed 10,000. So, he's saying that P(x) ≤10 when x=3.We computed P(3)= -11, which is indeed ≤10. So, the claim is valid.Alternatively, maybe the director is trying to say that the profit is not positive, but the question says \\"the profit margin (revenue minus cost) would not exceed 10,000\\". So, even if it's negative, it's still not exceeding 10,000. So, the claim is valid.Alternatively, maybe the director is implying that the profit is negative, but the question is just about whether it exceeds 10,000, regardless of sign. So, since it's -11, which is less than 10, the claim is valid.So, I think that's correct.**Final Answer**1. The number of students enrolled where revenue equals cost is approximately boxed{4.07} (in hundreds).2. The director’s claim is valid as the profit margin at 300 students does not exceed 10,000, so the answer is boxed{-11} thousand dollars."},{"question":"An Australian politician, who is pro-military and focused on international security, is planning to allocate resources for two major projects aimed at enhancing national defense. The first project involves upgrading the naval fleet, and the second project involves developing advanced cybersecurity systems. The politician has a budget of 120 million to allocate between these two projects.1. Let ( x ) represent the amount of money (in millions) allocated to the naval fleet project. The cost of the cybersecurity project must be 10 million more than twice the amount allocated to the naval fleet project. Write an equation to represent this situation and solve for ( x ) to determine how much money is allocated to each project.2. To ensure the cybersecurity systems are sustainable and effective, the politician has decided that the funds allocated to the cybersecurity project must meet the inequality ( y geq 2x + 20 ), where ( y ) is the amount allocated to cybersecurity. Determine the range of possible values for ( x ) that satisfy both the budget constraint and the inequality.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about an Australian politician who wants to allocate a 120 million budget between two defense projects: upgrading the naval fleet and developing advanced cybersecurity systems. There are two parts to this problem, and I need to solve both. Let me take it step by step.Starting with the first part. It says that x represents the amount allocated to the naval fleet project. The cost of the cybersecurity project must be 10 million more than twice the amount allocated to the naval fleet. So, if I let x be the naval fleet allocation, then the cybersecurity allocation, let's call it y, should be 2x + 10. But wait, the total budget is 120 million, so the sum of x and y should equal 120. That gives me an equation: x + y = 120. Since y is 2x + 10, I can substitute that into the equation. So, substituting, I get x + (2x + 10) = 120. Let me write that down:x + (2x + 10) = 120Simplifying the left side: x + 2x is 3x, and then +10, so 3x + 10 = 120.Now, solving for x: subtract 10 from both sides.3x = 120 - 103x = 110Then, divide both sides by 3.x = 110 / 3Hmm, 110 divided by 3 is approximately 36.666... So, x is about 36.67 million. But since we're dealing with money, it's probably better to keep it as a fraction. 110 divided by 3 is 36 and 2/3, so 36,666,666.67.Then, to find y, which is 2x + 10, I can plug in x = 110/3.y = 2*(110/3) + 10Calculating that: 2*(110/3) is 220/3, which is approximately 73.333... Then, adding 10, which is 10/1, so to add fractions, I can write 10 as 30/3.So, 220/3 + 30/3 = 250/3.250 divided by 3 is approximately 83.333... So, y is about 83.33 million.Let me check if x + y equals 120.36.666... + 83.333... = 120. Yes, that adds up correctly.So, for part 1, the allocation is approximately 36.67 million to the naval fleet and 83.33 million to cybersecurity. But to be precise, it's 110/3 million and 250/3 million.Moving on to part 2. The politician now wants the cybersecurity funds to meet the inequality y ≥ 2x + 20. So, previously, y was exactly 2x + 10, but now it has to be at least 2x + 20. But we still have the same total budget: x + y = 120. So, now, instead of y being exactly 2x + 10, it's y ≥ 2x + 20. So, I need to find the range of x that satisfies both x + y = 120 and y ≥ 2x + 20.Let me write down the inequalities:1. x + y = 1202. y ≥ 2x + 20Since x + y = 120, we can express y as 120 - x. So, substitute that into the inequality:120 - x ≥ 2x + 20Now, let's solve for x.First, bring all terms to one side:120 - x - 2x - 20 ≥ 0Simplify:(120 - 20) + (-x - 2x) ≥ 0100 - 3x ≥ 0Now, solving for x:-3x ≥ -100Divide both sides by -3. Remember, when you divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips.So, x ≤ (-100)/(-3)x ≤ 100/3100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.333... So, x must be less than or equal to 33.333... million.But we also have to consider the original equation from part 1, which was y = 2x + 10. However, in part 2, y is now required to be at least 2x + 20, which is a higher amount. So, does that mean x can be less than or equal to 100/3? But we also need to make sure that y doesn't exceed the budget when considering the inequality.Wait, let me think again. The total budget is fixed at 120 million. So, if y has to be at least 2x + 20, then x can't be too large, otherwise y would have to be too large, exceeding the budget.So, from the inequality, we found x ≤ 100/3, which is approximately 33.333 million. But we also need to check if x has a lower bound. Is there a minimum amount that must be allocated to the naval fleet?In the original problem, part 1 didn't specify any constraints on x other than the total budget. So, in part 2, is there a lower limit? Let me see.From the inequality y ≥ 2x + 20, and since y = 120 - x, we have:120 - x ≥ 2x + 20Which simplifies to x ≤ 100/3, as before. But is there a lower bound? Let's see.If we consider that both x and y must be non-negative, because you can't allocate a negative amount of money. So, x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.From y = 120 - x, since y must be ≥ 0, x must be ≤ 120. But in our inequality, we have a stricter upper bound of x ≤ 100/3 ≈33.333.But is there a lower bound? Let's see.If x is 0, then y would be 120. Does that satisfy y ≥ 2x + 20? Plugging in x=0, y=120 ≥ 0 + 20, which is true. So, x can be as low as 0. But wait, is that practical? Probably not, because the politician is pro-military, so maybe they would want to allocate some minimum to the naval fleet. But since the problem doesn't specify any other constraints, I think x can be from 0 up to 100/3.But let me verify. If x is 0, then y is 120, which is more than 2*0 +20=20, so that's fine. If x is 100/3, then y is 120 - 100/3 = (360/3 - 100/3)=260/3≈86.666. And 2x +20=2*(100/3)+20=200/3 +60/3=260/3≈86.666. So, at x=100/3, y=260/3, which is exactly equal to 2x +20. So, that's the upper limit.Therefore, the range of x is from 0 to 100/3, inclusive. But wait, in part 1, x was 110/3≈36.666, which is higher than 100/3≈33.333. So, in part 2, the allocation from part 1 would not satisfy the new inequality because x was 36.666, which is greater than 33.333. Therefore, the politician needs to adjust the allocation so that x is less than or equal to 33.333 million.But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequality.Starting again:From part 2, y ≥ 2x +20But y =120 -xSo, 120 -x ≥2x +20120 -20 ≥2x +x100 ≥3xSo, x ≤100/3≈33.333.Yes, that's correct.So, the range of x is 0 ≤x ≤100/3.But wait, in part 1, the allocation was x=110/3≈36.666, which is more than 100/3. So, in part 2, the politician needs to reallocate so that x is less than or equal to 33.333 million, which would mean y is at least 86.666 million.Therefore, the range of possible values for x is from 0 to 100/3 million dollars.But let me think if there's any other constraints. For example, in part 1, y was exactly 2x +10, but in part 2, it's y ≥2x +20. So, the minimum y is now higher, which means x has to be lower to compensate, keeping the total budget at 120.So, summarizing:Part 1: x=110/3≈36.666, y=250/3≈83.333.Part 2: x must be ≤100/3≈33.333, so the range is 0 ≤x ≤100/3.Wait, but in part 2, the politician is adding an additional constraint, so the allocation from part 1 doesn't satisfy part 2. Therefore, the politician needs to adjust the allocation so that y is at least 2x +20, which requires x to be less than or equal to 100/3.But is there a lower bound on x? The problem doesn't specify any, so theoretically, x could be 0, but that might not be practical. However, since the problem doesn't mention any other constraints, I think the range is from 0 to 100/3.But let me check if x can be 0. If x=0, then y=120, which is more than 2*0 +20=20, so that's fine. Similarly, if x=100/3, y=260/3≈86.666, which is exactly 2x +20. So, that's the upper limit.Therefore, the range of x is 0 ≤x ≤100/3.But wait, in part 1, the allocation was x=110/3≈36.666, which is more than 100/3. So, in part 2, the politician needs to reallocate so that x is less than or equal to 33.333 million, which would mean y is at least 86.666 million.So, to answer part 2, the range of x is from 0 to 100/3 million dollars.But let me write the exact fractions instead of decimals.100/3 is approximately 33.333, and 110/3 is approximately 36.666.So, in part 2, x must be less than or equal to 100/3.Therefore, the range is 0 ≤x ≤100/3.But wait, in part 1, the allocation was x=110/3, which is more than 100/3, so in part 2, the politician needs to reduce x to at most 100/3.So, the possible values for x are from 0 up to 100/3 million.I think that's correct.Let me recap:Part 1:x + y =120y=2x +10So, x=110/3≈36.666, y=250/3≈83.333.Part 2:y ≥2x +20With x + y=120, so y=120 -x.Thus, 120 -x ≥2x +20120 -20 ≥3x100 ≥3xx ≤100/3≈33.333.So, x can be any value from 0 to 100/3 million.Therefore, the range is 0 ≤x ≤100/3.I think that's the solution."},{"question":"A documentary filmmaker is working on a film about social movements and needs to plan the budget for filming interviews and purchasing archival footage. The filmmaker has a budget of 10,000. Each interview costs 400 to film, and purchasing archival footage costs 250 per minute. 1. If the filmmaker plans to conduct ( x ) interviews and purchase ( y ) minutes of archival footage, write an inequality that represents the budget constraint. Then solve the inequality for ( y ) in terms of ( x ).2. The filmmaker estimates that the film should include at least 20 minutes of archival footage and no more than 15 interviews. Formulate a system of inequalities to represent these constraints. How many full interviews can the filmmaker conduct if they decide to purchase 30 minutes of archival footage?","answer":"First, I need to establish the budget constraint for the filmmaker. Each interview costs 400 and each minute of archival footage costs 250. The total budget is 10,000. This means that the cost of all interviews plus the cost of all archival footage should not exceed 10,000. So, the inequality representing this constraint is 400x + 250y ≤ 10,000.Next, I'll solve this inequality for y in terms of x to understand how the number of interviews affects the amount of archival footage that can be purchased. By isolating y, the equation becomes y ≤ (10,000 - 400x) / 250, which simplifies to y ≤ 40 - 1.6x.Moving on to the second part, the filmmaker has additional constraints: at least 20 minutes of archival footage (y ≥ 20) and no more than 15 interviews (x ≤ 15). Combining these with the budget constraint, the system of inequalities is:1. 400x + 250y ≤ 10,0002. y ≥ 203. x ≤ 15If the filmmaker decides to purchase 30 minutes of archival footage, I'll substitute y = 30 into the budget constraint to find the maximum number of interviews possible. This gives 400x + 250(30) ≤ 10,000, which simplifies to 400x + 7,500 ≤ 10,000. Subtracting 7,500 from both sides results in 400x ≤ 2,500. Dividing both sides by 400, I find that x ≤ 6.25. Since the filmmaker can only conduct whole interviews, the maximum number of interviews is 6."},{"question":"A statistician is analyzing the relationship between two variables, ( x ) and ( y ), where ( x ) represents the number of hours spent on quantitative research, and ( y ) represents the number of hours spent on qualitative research.

Knowing the importance of maintaining a balance between quantitative and qualitative research, the statistician decides to spend twice as much time on quantitative research as on qualitative research. Under this new condition, solve for ( x ) using the equation from part 1, assuming ( y = frac{x}{2} ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a statistician is analyzing the relationship between two variables, x and y. Here, x is the number of hours spent on quantitative research, and y is the number of hours spent on qualitative research. Their productivity is modeled by the polynomial equation P(x, y) = 2x² - 3xy + y² - 5x + 6y.Part 1 asks me to find all possible pairs of integers (x, y) that satisfy the equation 2x² - 3xy + y² - 5x + 6y = 10. So, I need to solve this equation for integer values of x and y.First, let me write down the equation:2x² - 3xy + y² - 5x + 6y = 10.Hmm, this is a quadratic equation in two variables. Solving such equations for integer solutions can be tricky because there are infinitely many possibilities. But maybe I can manipulate the equation to make it more manageable.Let me try to rearrange the equation:2x² - 3xy + y² - 5x + 6y - 10 = 0.I wonder if I can complete the square or factor this somehow. Let me see if grouping terms helps.Looking at the equation, I notice that the quadratic terms are 2x², -3xy, and y². Maybe I can group these together.So, 2x² - 3xy + y² can be thought of as a quadratic in x or y. Let me try to treat this as a quadratic in x.So, writing it as:2x² - (3y + 5)x + (y² + 6y - 10) = 0.Yes, that's a quadratic equation in terms of x, where the coefficients are in terms of y. So, maybe I can use the quadratic formula to solve for x in terms of y.The quadratic formula is x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a).Here, a = 2, b = -(3y + 5), and c = y² + 6y - 10.Plugging these into the quadratic formula:x = [ (3y + 5) ± sqrt( (3y + 5)² - 4*2*(y² + 6y - 10) ) ] / (2*2).Simplify the discriminant D:D = (3y + 5)² - 8(y² + 6y - 10).Let me compute this step by step.First, expand (3y + 5)²:(3y + 5)² = 9y² + 30y + 25.Then, expand 8(y² + 6y - 10):8y² + 48y - 80.Now, subtract the second expansion from the first:D = (9y² + 30y + 25) - (8y² + 48y - 80) = 9y² + 30y + 25 - 8y² - 48y + 80.Combine like terms:(9y² - 8y²) + (30y - 48y) + (25 + 80) = y² - 18y + 105.So, the discriminant D is y² - 18y + 105.For x to be an integer, the discriminant D must be a perfect square because the square root of D needs to be an integer. So, let me denote D = k², where k is an integer.Therefore, y² - 18y + 105 = k².This is another quadratic equation, but now in terms of y and k. Let me rearrange it:y² - 18y + (105 - k²) = 0.Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can complete the square for y.Completing the square for y:y² - 18y = (y - 9)² - 81.So, substituting back into the equation:(y - 9)² - 81 + 105 - k² = 0.Simplify:(y - 9)² + 24 - k² = 0.Which can be written as:(y - 9)² = k² - 24.So, (y - 9)² = k² - 24.This implies that k² - (y - 9)² = 24.This is a difference of squares, so it factors as:(k - (y - 9))(k + (y - 9)) = 24.Let me denote m = k - (y - 9) and n = k + (y - 9), so that m * n = 24.Also, since k and y are integers, m and n must be integers as well, and m and n must be factors of 24.Moreover, since n > m (because k + (y - 9) > k - (y - 9) if y - 9 is positive, but actually, depending on the sign, this might not necessarily hold. Hmm, maybe I should consider all factor pairs, both positive and negative.So, the factor pairs of 24 are:(1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6), (-1, -24), (-2, -12), (-3, -8), (-4, -6).Also, considering that m and n can be in any order, but since m * n = 24, each pair is unique.So, for each factor pair (m, n), we can solve for k and y.Given that m = k - (y - 9) and n = k + (y - 9).So, adding these two equations:m + n = 2k => k = (m + n)/2.Subtracting the first equation from the second:n - m = 2(y - 9) => y - 9 = (n - m)/2 => y = 9 + (n - m)/2.Since y must be an integer, (n - m) must be even, which it is because m and n are both integers and their difference is even if m and n are both even or both odd. Since 24 is even, all factor pairs consist of both even or both odd? Wait, 24 is even, so all factor pairs must consist of both even or both odd? Wait, 24 is even, so actually, all factor pairs will have at least one even number, but in reality, 24 can be factored into pairs where both are even or one is even and one is odd? Wait, no, 24 is even, so all its factors are even or odd? Wait, 24 is divisible by 2, so all its factors are even or odd? Wait, 24 is even, so any factor pair must consist of at least one even number. Because if both factors were odd, their product would be odd, but 24 is even. So, all factor pairs must include at least one even number.Therefore, in each factor pair, at least one of m or n is even, so n - m will be even or odd? Let's see:If both m and n are even, then n - m is even.If one is even and the other is odd, n - m is odd.But since 24 is even, and m * n = 24, if one is even and the other is odd, their product is even, which is acceptable. However, in our case, y must be integer, so (n - m)/2 must be integer, which requires that n - m is even. Therefore, n - m must be even, so n and m must be both even or both odd. But since 24 is even, and m * n = 24, if both are odd, their product would be odd, which contradicts 24 being even. Therefore, both m and n must be even.Therefore, only factor pairs where both m and n are even will result in integer y.So, let's list the factor pairs of 24 where both factors are even:(2, 12), (4, 6), (-2, -12), (-4, -6).Wait, but hold on, 24 can also be factored as ( -2, -12 ), ( -4, -6 ), etc. So, let's consider all positive and negative factor pairs where both are even.So, the factor pairs are:(2, 12), (4, 6), (-2, -12), (-4, -6).Wait, but actually, 24 can also be factored as ( -1, -24 ), but since we established that both m and n must be even, we can ignore the pairs where one is odd.So, let's proceed with the factor pairs where both m and n are even:1. (2, 12)2. (4, 6)3. (-2, -12)4. (-4, -6)Now, let's compute k and y for each pair.First pair: m = 2, n = 12.Compute k:k = (m + n)/2 = (2 + 12)/2 = 14/2 = 7.Compute y:y = 9 + (n - m)/2 = 9 + (12 - 2)/2 = 9 + 10/2 = 9 + 5 = 14.So, y = 14, k = 7.Now, go back to the quadratic in x:x = [ (3y + 5) ± k ] / 4.Plugging in y =14 and k =7:x = [ (3*14 + 5) ±7 ] /4 = [ (42 +5) ±7 ] /4 = [47 ±7]/4.So, two possibilities:x = (47 +7)/4 = 54/4 = 13.5, which is not integer.x = (47 -7)/4 = 40/4 = 10, which is integer.So, x =10, y=14 is a solution.Second pair: m=4, n=6.Compute k:k = (4 +6)/2 =10/2=5.Compute y:y=9 + (6 -4)/2=9 +2/2=9 +1=10.So, y=10, k=5.Now, compute x:x = [ (3*10 +5 ) ±5 ] /4 = [35 ±5]/4.So,x=(35+5)/4=40/4=10,x=(35-5)/4=30/4=7.5, which is not integer.So, x=10, y=10 is another solution.Third pair: m=-2, n=-12.Compute k:k=(-2 + (-12))/2=(-14)/2=-7.Compute y:y=9 + (-12 - (-2))/2=9 + (-10)/2=9 -5=4.So, y=4, k=-7.Now, compute x:x = [ (3*4 +5 ) ± (-7) ] /4 = [12 +5 ± (-7)] /4 = [17 ± (-7)] /4.So,x=(17 -7)/4=10/4=2.5, not integer.x=(17 + (-7))/4=10/4=2.5, same result.Wait, both give 2.5, which is not integer. Hmm, so no solution here.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing y.Wait, y=9 + (n - m)/2.n=-12, m=-2.So, n - m = -12 - (-2)= -10.So, y=9 + (-10)/2=9 -5=4. That's correct.So, x is 2.5, which is not integer, so discard this pair.Fourth pair: m=-4, n=-6.Compute k:k=(-4 + (-6))/2=(-10)/2=-5.Compute y:y=9 + (-6 - (-4))/2=9 + (-2)/2=9 -1=8.So, y=8, k=-5.Compute x:x = [ (3*8 +5 ) ± (-5) ] /4 = [24 +5 ± (-5)] /4 = [29 ± (-5)] /4.So,x=(29 -5)/4=24/4=6,x=(29 + (-5))/4=24/4=6.Wait, both give x=6. So, x=6, y=8 is a solution.Wait, hold on, both plus and minus give same result? Let me check:[29 - (-5)] /4 = 34/4=8.5, which is not integer.Wait, no, wait, [29 + (-5)] is 24, which is 24/4=6.Wait, no, the equation is [29 ± (-5)] /4.So, that's [29 + (-5)] =24, and [29 - (-5)]=34.So, x=24/4=6, and x=34/4=8.5.So, only x=6 is integer.So, x=6, y=8 is another solution.So, so far, from the four factor pairs, we have solutions:(10,14), (10,10), and (6,8).Wait, but hold on, when we had m=2, n=12, we got x=10, y=14.When m=4, n=6, we got x=10, y=10.When m=-4, n=-6, we got x=6, y=8.But when m=-2, n=-12, we got x=2.5, which is not integer, so we discard that.Wait, but are there more factor pairs? Because 24 can also be factored as ( -1, -24 ), but since both m and n must be even, as we saw earlier, we can ignore those.Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed some factor pairs where both m and n are even.Wait, 24 can also be factored as ( -6, -4 ), but that's same as (-4, -6), which we already considered.Similarly, ( -12, -2 ) is same as (-2, -12).So, I think we have considered all possible factor pairs where both m and n are even.Therefore, the integer solutions are:(x, y) = (10,14), (10,10), (6,8).Wait, but let me check if these actually satisfy the original equation.First, (10,14):2*(10)^2 -3*(10)*(14) + (14)^2 -5*(10) +6*(14).Compute step by step:2*100=200,-3*10*14= -420,14²=196,-5*10= -50,6*14=84.So, total: 200 -420 +196 -50 +84.Compute:200 -420 = -220,-220 +196 = -24,-24 -50 = -74,-74 +84=10. Correct.Second, (10,10):2*100 -3*10*10 +100 -50 +60.Compute:200 -300 +100 -50 +60.200 -300= -100,-100 +100=0,0 -50= -50,-50 +60=10. Correct.Third, (6,8):2*36 -3*6*8 +64 -30 +48.Compute:72 -144 +64 -30 +48.72 -144= -72,-72 +64= -8,-8 -30= -38,-38 +48=10. Correct.So, these three solutions are valid.Wait, but I feel like maybe there are more solutions. Let me think.Because when I set m and n as factor pairs, I considered only the ones where both are even, but perhaps I missed some.Wait, let me think again about the discriminant.We had D = y² - 18y +105 = k².We completed the square and got (y -9)^2 = k² -24.Which led us to (y -9)^2 -k² = -24.Which factors as (y -9 -k)(y -9 +k)= -24.Wait, but in my earlier approach, I set m = k - (y -9) and n = k + (y -9), which led to m * n =24.But perhaps I should have considered that (y -9 -k)(y -9 +k)= -24.So, that would mean that m = y -9 -k and n = y -9 +k, so that m * n = -24.Then, m and n are integers, and m + n = 2(y -9).So, similar approach, but now m * n = -24.So, factor pairs of -24 where both m and n are integers.So, the factor pairs are:(1, -24), (2, -12), (3, -8), (4, -6), (-1,24), (-2,12), (-3,8), (-4,6).Again, since m and n must be such that m + n is even because 2(y -9) must be even, so m + n must be even.Therefore, m and n must be both even or both odd.But since -24 is even, all factor pairs must include at least one even number, but similar to before, if both are even, their sum is even; if one is even and one is odd, their sum is odd, which would make y non-integer.Therefore, only factor pairs where both m and n are even will result in integer y.So, factor pairs of -24 where both m and n are even:(2, -12), (4, -6), (-2,12), (-4,6).So, four factor pairs.Let me compute for each:First pair: m=2, n=-12.Compute y:m + n =2 + (-12)= -10=2(y -9)=> y -9= -5 => y=4.Compute k:From m = y -9 -k => 2=4 -9 -k =>2= -5 -k =>k= -7.So, k=-7, y=4.Now, compute x:x = [ (3y +5 ) ±k ] /4 = [ (12 +5 ) ± (-7) ] /4 = [17 ± (-7)] /4.So,x=(17 -7)/4=10/4=2.5, not integer.x=(17 + (-7))/4=10/4=2.5, same result.So, no integer solution here.Second pair: m=4, n=-6.Compute y:m + n=4 + (-6)= -2=2(y -9)=> y -9= -1 => y=8.Compute k:From m = y -9 -k =>4=8 -9 -k =>4= -1 -k =>k= -5.So, k=-5, y=8.Compute x:x = [ (24 +5 ) ± (-5) ] /4 = [29 ± (-5)] /4.So,x=(29 - (-5))/4=34/4=8.5, not integer.x=(29 + (-5))/4=24/4=6, which is integer.So, x=6, y=8 is a solution, which we already found earlier.Third pair: m=-2, n=12.Compute y:m +n= -2 +12=10=2(y -9)=> y -9=5 => y=14.Compute k:From m = y -9 -k =>-2=14 -9 -k =>-2=5 -k =>k=7.So, k=7, y=14.Compute x:x = [ (42 +5 ) ±7 ] /4 = [47 ±7]/4.So,x=(47 +7)/4=54/4=13.5, not integer.x=(47 -7)/4=40/4=10, which is integer.So, x=10, y=14 is a solution, which we already found.Fourth pair: m=-4, n=6.Compute y:m +n= -4 +6=2=2(y -9)=> y -9=1 => y=10.Compute k:From m = y -9 -k =>-4=10 -9 -k =>-4=1 -k =>k=5.So, k=5, y=10.Compute x:x = [ (30 +5 ) ±5 ] /4 = [35 ±5]/4.So,x=(35 +5)/4=40/4=10,x=(35 -5)/4=30/4=7.5, not integer.So, x=10, y=10 is a solution, which we already found.Therefore, considering both positive and negative factor pairs, we still only get the three integer solutions: (10,14), (10,10), and (6,8).Wait, but let me check if there are any other factor pairs where m and n are both even. For example, ( -6,4 ), but that's same as (4, -6), which we already considered.Similarly, ( -12,2 ) is same as (2, -12), which we already considered.So, I think we have exhausted all possible factor pairs where both m and n are even, leading to the three integer solutions.Therefore, the integer solutions are (x, y) = (6,8), (10,10), and (10,14).Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that y could be negative? Because in the original problem, x and y represent hours spent on research, so they should be non-negative integers. So, y cannot be negative. So, we don't need to consider negative y values.Therefore, our solutions are correct as they are.So, for part 1, the integer solutions are (6,8), (10,10), and (10,14).Now, moving on to part 2.The statistician decides to spend twice as much time on quantitative research as on qualitative research, meaning x = 2y.Wait, no, the problem says \\"spend twice as much time on quantitative research as on qualitative research.\\" So, quantitative is x, qualitative is y. So, x = 2y.Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \\"assuming y = x/2\\". Wait, let me check.Wait, the problem says: \\"the statistician decides to spend twice as much time on quantitative research as on qualitative research. Under this new condition, solve for x using the equation from part 1, assuming y = x/2.\\"Wait, so if the statistician spends twice as much time on quantitative research as on qualitative, that means x = 2y. So, y = x/2.Therefore, substituting y = x/2 into the equation from part 1, which is 2x² - 3xy + y² -5x +6y =10.So, let's substitute y = x/2 into the equation.First, compute each term:2x² remains 2x².-3xy becomes -3x*(x/2)= -3x²/2.y² becomes (x/2)²= x²/4.-5x remains -5x.6y becomes 6*(x/2)=3x.So, putting it all together:2x² - (3x²)/2 + (x²)/4 -5x +3x =10.Simplify term by term:2x² - 1.5x² + 0.25x² -5x +3x.Combine like terms:(2 -1.5 +0.25)x² + (-5x +3x).Compute coefficients:2 -1.5=0.5; 0.5 +0.25=0.75.-5x +3x= -2x.So, the equation becomes:0.75x² -2x =10.To make it easier, let's multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimal:4*(0.75x² -2x) =4*10.Which gives:3x² -8x =40.Bring all terms to one side:3x² -8x -40=0.Now, we have a quadratic equation: 3x² -8x -40=0.Let's solve for x using quadratic formula.x = [8 ± sqrt(64 + 480)] /6.Because discriminant D = b² -4ac = (-8)^2 -4*3*(-40)=64 +480=544.So, sqrt(544). Let's simplify sqrt(544).544 divided by 16 is 34, so sqrt(544)=sqrt(16*34)=4*sqrt(34).So, x = [8 ±4sqrt(34)] /6.Simplify:Factor numerator: 4(2 ±sqrt(34))/6.Simplify fraction: 2(2 ±sqrt(34))/3.So, x= [2 ±sqrt(34)]*(2)/3.Wait, actually, let me write it correctly.x = [8 ±4sqrt(34)] /6.Factor out 2 from numerator and denominator:x= [2*(4 ±2sqrt(34))]/6= [4 ±2sqrt(34)]/3.So, x= (4 +2sqrt(34))/3 and x=(4 -2sqrt(34))/3.Compute approximate values to check feasibility.sqrt(34) is approximately 5.830.So,x=(4 +2*5.830)/3=(4 +11.66)/3≈15.66/3≈5.22.x=(4 -11.66)/3≈(-7.66)/3≈-2.55.Since x represents hours spent, it cannot be negative. So, x≈5.22 is the only feasible solution.But wait, the problem says to solve for x, but it doesn't specify that x must be integer. However, in part 1, we were looking for integer solutions, but in part 2, it's a different condition, so x can be any real number, but since the statistician can't spend a fraction of an hour, maybe we need to consider integer solutions again? Wait, the problem doesn't specify, but in part 1, it was about integer pairs, but in part 2, it's just solving for x, so perhaps we can leave it as is.But let me check the problem statement again.\\"Knowing the importance of maintaining a balance between quantitative and qualitative research, the statistician decides to spend twice as much time on quantitative research as on qualitative research. Under this new condition, solve for x using the equation from part 1, assuming y = x/2.\\"So, it says \\"solve for x\\", so likely, we need to present the exact value, which is x=(4 ±2sqrt(34))/3, but since x must be positive, x=(4 +2sqrt(34))/3.Alternatively, we can write it as x= (4 + 2√34)/3.But let me check if I did the substitution correctly.Original equation: 2x² -3xy + y² -5x +6y=10.Substitute y=x/2:2x² -3x*(x/2) + (x/2)² -5x +6*(x/2)=10.Compute each term:2x²,-3x*(x/2)= -3x²/2,(x/2)²= x²/4,-5x,6*(x/2)=3x.So, equation becomes:2x² - (3/2)x² + (1/4)x² -5x +3x=10.Combine like terms:2x² -1.5x² +0.25x²= (2 -1.5 +0.25)x²=0.75x².-5x +3x= -2x.So, 0.75x² -2x=10.Multiply both sides by 4: 3x² -8x=40.3x² -8x -40=0.Yes, that's correct.So, quadratic formula:x=(8 ±sqrt(64 +480))/6=(8 ±sqrt(544))/6=(8 ±4sqrt(34))/6=(4 ±2sqrt(34))/3.So, x=(4 +2sqrt(34))/3≈(4 +11.66)/3≈15.66/3≈5.22.And x=(4 -2sqrt(34))/3≈(4 -11.66)/3≈-7.66/3≈-2.55, which is negative, so discard.Therefore, x≈5.22 hours.But since the problem didn't specify whether x needs to be integer, I think this is the answer.But wait, in part 1, we were looking for integer solutions, but in part 2, it's a different condition, so x can be any real number, but perhaps the problem expects an exact value.So, the exact value is x=(4 +2√34)/3.Alternatively, we can factor numerator:x=2(2 +√34)/3.But both forms are acceptable.Therefore, the solution is x=(4 +2√34)/3.But let me check if I can simplify it further.Alternatively, x= (4 +2√34)/3= (2(2 +√34))/3= (2/3)(2 +√34).But I think (4 +2√34)/3 is fine.So, summarizing:Part 1: Integer solutions are (6,8), (10,10), (10,14).Part 2: x=(4 +2√34)/3.But wait, let me check if I can write it as x=(2(2 +√34))/3, which is the same.Alternatively, x= (4 +2√34)/3.Yes, that's correct.So, I think that's the answer."},{"question":"Laura, a middle-aged woman who occasionally interacted with her neighbor, Mike \\"Fish\\" Fisher, is planning a community fish fry. As part of the preparation, she needs to calculate the amount of fish required and the cost involved. Laura knows that Mike often donates fish from his catch, and she decides to use a quadratic equation to estimate the total fish required based on past events.1. In past events, the relationship between the number of attendees (x) and the pounds of fish required (y) can be modeled by the quadratic equation: ( y = 0.5x^2 + 3x + 20 ). If Laura expects 30 people to attend the fish fry, determine how many pounds of fish will be required.2. Laura has calculated that the cost of purchasing additional fish is 4 per pound. If Mike donates 50 pounds of fish, calculate the total cost Laura will incur to purchase the remaining fish needed for the event.","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of pounds of fish required for 30 attendees using the quadratic equation ( y = 0.5x^2 + 3x + 20 ). I'll substitute ( x = 30 ) into the equation.Calculating ( 0.5 times 30^2 ) gives ( 0.5 times 900 = 450 ).Next, calculating ( 3 times 30 ) results in ( 90 ).Adding the constant term ( 20 ), the total pounds of fish needed is ( 450 + 90 + 20 = 560 ) pounds.Laura expects Mike to donate 50 pounds of fish, so she needs to purchase ( 560 - 50 = 510 ) pounds.The cost per pound of fish is 4, so the total cost Laura will incur is ( 510 times 4 = 2040 )."},{"question":"A punk rocker who admires Devo wants to create a unique sound system inspired by the band's futuristic style.

The punk rocker wants the total volume of three such stacked sections to be 1500 cubic inches. Using your expression from the first part, set up and solve the equation to find the value of ( r ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a punk rocker who wants to create a unique sound system inspired by Devo's \\"Energy Dome\\" hats. The speakers are arranged in a geometric pattern that resembles these hats, which are made up of stacked, truncated cones. The first part of the problem gives me the formula for the volume of each truncated cone section. The formula is ( V = frac{1}{3} pi h (R^2 + r^2 + Rr) ). They tell me that the larger base radius ( R ) is twice the smaller base radius ( r ), and the height ( h ) is three times the smaller base radius. I need to express the volume ( V ) in terms of ( r ) only.Alright, let's break this down. I know that ( R = 2r ) and ( h = 3r ). So I can substitute these into the volume formula to eliminate ( R ) and ( h ).Let me write that out step by step.First, substitute ( R = 2r ) into the formula:( V = frac{1}{3} pi h ((2r)^2 + r^2 + (2r)(r)) )Simplify each term inside the parentheses:- ( (2r)^2 = 4r^2 )- ( r^2 = r^2 )- ( (2r)(r) = 2r^2 )So, substituting these back in:( V = frac{1}{3} pi h (4r^2 + r^2 + 2r^2) )Combine like terms inside the parentheses:4r² + r² is 5r², and then +2r² makes 7r². So:( V = frac{1}{3} pi h (7r^2) )Now, substitute ( h = 3r ):( V = frac{1}{3} pi (3r) (7r^2) )Simplify this expression:First, ( frac{1}{3} times 3r = r ), so:( V = r times 7r^2 times pi )Multiply ( r ) and ( 7r^2 ):( r times 7r^2 = 7r^3 )So, the volume becomes:( V = 7pi r^3 )Wait, let me double-check that. So, starting from the substitution:( V = frac{1}{3} pi (3r) (7r^2) )Multiplying ( frac{1}{3} ) and ( 3r ) gives ( r ), so:( V = r times 7r^2 times pi = 7pi r^3 )Yes, that seems right. So, the volume of each truncated cone section is ( 7pi r^3 ).Okay, moving on to the second part. The punk rocker wants the total volume of three such stacked sections to be 1500 cubic inches. I need to set up and solve the equation to find the value of ( r ).Since each section has a volume of ( 7pi r^3 ), three sections would have a total volume of:( 3 times 7pi r^3 = 21pi r^3 )So, the equation is:( 21pi r^3 = 1500 )I need to solve for ( r ). Let me write that equation again:( 21pi r^3 = 1500 )First, divide both sides by ( 21pi ):( r^3 = frac{1500}{21pi} )Simplify the fraction ( frac{1500}{21} ). Let's see, 1500 divided by 21. 21 times 70 is 1470, so 1500 - 1470 is 30. So, 1500 / 21 = 71 and 9/21, which simplifies to 71 and 3/7, or as an improper fraction, 500/7. Wait, let me check that.Wait, 21 times 71 is 1491, right? 21*70=1470, plus 21=1491. Then 1500 - 1491 is 9, so 1500/21 is 71 and 9/21, which reduces to 71 and 3/7, or 500/7? Wait, no, 71*7=497, plus 3 is 500, so yeah, 500/7.So, ( r^3 = frac{500}{7pi} )Now, to solve for ( r ), take the cube root of both sides:( r = sqrt[3]{frac{500}{7pi}} )I can compute this numerically if needed, but the problem doesn't specify whether to leave it in terms of pi or give a decimal approximation. Since it's about volume in cubic inches, probably a numerical value is expected.Let me compute this step by step.First, calculate the denominator: 7π. π is approximately 3.1416, so 7*3.1416 ≈ 21.9911.Then, 500 divided by 21.9911 ≈ 500 / 21.9911 ≈ 22.73.So, ( r^3 ≈ 22.73 )Now, take the cube root of 22.73. Let me recall that 2^3=8, 3^3=27. So, cube root of 22.73 is between 2 and 3. Let's see, 2.8^3=21.952, 2.85^3=23.15. So, 2.8^3=21.952, 2.85^3≈23.15.Our value is 22.73, which is between 21.952 and 23.15. So, let's do a linear approximation.Difference between 2.8 and 2.85 is 0.05, and the difference in their cubes is 23.15 - 21.952 = 1.198.Our target is 22.73 - 21.952 = 0.778 above 2.8^3.So, fraction = 0.778 / 1.198 ≈ 0.65.So, approximately 2.8 + 0.65*0.05 ≈ 2.8 + 0.0325 ≈ 2.8325.So, r ≈ 2.8325 inches.Let me check 2.83^3:2.83^3 = (2.83)*(2.83)*(2.83)First, 2.83*2.83: 2*2=4, 2*0.83=1.66, 0.83*2=1.66, 0.83*0.83≈0.6889.So, adding up: 4 + 1.66 + 1.66 + 0.6889 ≈ 4 + 3.32 + 0.6889 ≈ 8 + 0.6889 ≈ 8.6889.Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, 2.83*2.83 is actually 8.0089. Wait, let me compute it correctly.Wait, 2.83 squared:2.83 * 2.83:Compute 2 * 2.83 = 5.66Compute 0.83 * 2.83:Compute 0.8 * 2.83 = 2.264Compute 0.03 * 2.83 = 0.0849So, 2.264 + 0.0849 = 2.3489So, total is 5.66 + 2.3489 = 8.0089So, 2.83 squared is approximately 8.0089.Then, 2.83 cubed is 8.0089 * 2.83.Compute 8 * 2.83 = 22.64Compute 0.0089 * 2.83 ≈ 0.0252So, total ≈ 22.64 + 0.0252 ≈ 22.6652Which is very close to our target of 22.73. So, 2.83^3 ≈22.6652, which is just a bit less than 22.73.So, the difference is 22.73 -22.6652≈0.0648.So, how much more do we need? Let's see, derivative of x^3 at x=2.83 is 3x²≈3*(8.0089)=24.0267.So, delta x ≈ delta y / derivative ≈ 0.0648 /24.0267≈0.0027.So, x≈2.83 +0.0027≈2.8327.So, r≈2.8327 inches.So, approximately 2.833 inches.To check, let's compute 2.833^3.First, 2.833 squared:2.833 * 2.833:Let me compute 2.83 *2.83=8.0089 as before.Then, 0.003*2.83=0.00849, so 2.833 squared is approximately 8.0089 + 0.00849 + 0.00849≈8.0259.Wait, no, actually, (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=2.83, b=0.003.So, (2.83 +0.003)^2=2.83² + 2*2.83*0.003 +0.003²=8.0089 +0.01698 +0.000009≈8.025889.Then, 2.833 cubed is 8.025889 *2.833.Compute 8 *2.833=22.664Compute 0.025889*2.833≈0.0733So, total≈22.664 +0.0733≈22.7373Which is very close to 22.73. So, 2.833^3≈22.7373, which is just a bit over 22.73.So, the cube root of 22.73 is approximately 2.833 inches.Therefore, r≈2.833 inches.But let me see if I can get a more accurate value.Alternatively, maybe use a calculator approach.But since I don't have a calculator here, perhaps I can use logarithms or something else, but that might be too time-consuming.Alternatively, accept that r≈2.833 inches.But let me check the exact value:We had ( r^3 = frac{500}{7pi} )Compute 500/(7π):500 / (7*3.1415926535) ≈500 /21.9911≈22.73So, r≈cube root of 22.73≈2.833 inches.So, rounding to a reasonable decimal place, maybe 2.83 inches.But let me see, the problem says to find the value of r, so perhaps we can leave it in terms of pi, but the problem says to set up and solve the equation, so likely expects a numerical value.So, I think 2.83 inches is a good approximation.Alternatively, if I use more precise calculations.Wait, let me compute 2.833^3 more accurately.2.833 *2.833=8.025889 as above.Then, 8.025889 *2.833:Compute 8 *2.833=22.664Compute 0.025889*2.833:0.02*2.833=0.056660.005889*2.833≈0.01666So, total≈0.05666 +0.01666≈0.07332So, total≈22.664 +0.07332≈22.73732Which is 22.73732, which is 0.00732 over 22.73.So, to get closer, let's subtract a little bit.Let me compute 2.833 - delta.Let delta be small, such that (2.833 - delta)^3=22.73.Using linear approximation:(2.833 - delta)^3 ≈2.833^3 -3*(2.833)^2 *delta=22.7373 -3*(8.025889)*delta=22.7373 -24.077667*deltaSet this equal to 22.73:22.7373 -24.077667*delta=22.73So, 22.7373 -22.73=24.077667*delta0.0073=24.077667*deltaSo, delta≈0.0073 /24.077667≈0.000303So, r≈2.833 -0.000303≈2.8327 inches.So, approximately 2.8327 inches, which is about 2.833 inches.So, rounding to three decimal places, 2.833 inches.Alternatively, to two decimal places, 2.83 inches.But let me see, in the context of the problem, is there a specific precision required? The problem says the total volume is 1500 cubic inches, which is given to the nearest cubic inch, so probably r should be given to a reasonable decimal place, maybe two or three.So, 2.83 inches is probably sufficient.Alternatively, if I compute it more accurately, but I think 2.83 is good.So, summarizing:1. Expressed the volume in terms of r: ( V = 7pi r^3 )2. Set up the equation for three sections: ( 21pi r^3 = 1500 )3. Solved for r: ( r ≈2.83 ) inches.Wait, let me just double-check the initial substitution.Given ( R = 2r ), ( h=3r ), so substituting into ( V = frac{1}{3}pi h(R² + r² + Rr) ):Yes, ( R² =4r² ), ( r²=r² ), ( Rr=2r² ), so sum is 7r².Then, ( V= frac{1}{3}pi *3r *7r²=7pi r³ ). Correct.Then, three sections: 21πr³=1500, so r³=1500/(21π)=500/(7π). Correct.Then, r≈cube root of (500/(7π))≈cube root of 22.73≈2.83 inches.Yes, that seems consistent.So, I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( r ) is boxed{2.83} inches."},{"question":"A composer and music producer is working on a project that involves creating a new piece of music software. As part of this project, they need to model sound wave frequencies using polynomial functions. The software allows users to manipulate sound waves by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of a wave represented by the function ( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ).1. Determine the frequencies (or roots) where the sound wave produces no sound, meaning the output is zero. Solve for ( x ) where ( f(x) = 0 ).2. Additionally, the software allows users to enhance certain frequencies by doubling their amplitude. If the initial amplitude at frequency ( x = 2 ) is given by the function ( g(x) = sqrt{x + 4} ), calculate the new amplitude after doubling.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about modeling sound wave frequencies using polynomial functions. It's part of a music software project, which sounds pretty cool! The function given is ( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ). The first task is to find the roots of this polynomial, which represent the frequencies where the sound wave produces no sound, meaning the output is zero. Okay, let's start with the first part. I need to solve ( f(x) = 0 ), so that's ( x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 ). Hmm, solving a cubic equation. I remember that for polynomials, especially lower-degree ones, factoring is a good approach. Maybe I can factor this cubic into simpler polynomials, perhaps even linear factors.First, I should check if there are any rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction ( frac{p}{q} ), has a numerator ( p ) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator ( q ) that is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -6, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are ( pm1, pm2, pm3, pm6 ).Let me test these possible roots by plugging them into the function.Starting with ( x = 1 ):( f(1) = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0 ). Oh, that works! So, ( x = 1 ) is a root. That means ( (x - 1) ) is a factor of the polynomial.Now, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out ( (x - 1) ) from ( f(x) ). Let me use synthetic division because it's quicker.Setting up synthetic division with root 1:1 | 1  -6  11  -6        1  -5   6      1  -5   6   0So, after division, the polynomial becomes ( (x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6) ). Now, I need to factor the quadratic ( x^2 - 5x + 6 ). Let's see, looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. Those numbers are -2 and -3. So, the quadratic factors as ( (x - 2)(x - 3) ).Putting it all together, the polynomial factors as ( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) ). Therefore, the roots are ( x = 1 ), ( x = 2 ), and ( x = 3 ). So, these are the frequencies where the sound wave produces no sound.Wait, let me double-check my factoring to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I expand ( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) ), I should get back the original polynomial.First, multiply ( (x - 1)(x - 2) ):( x^2 - 2x - x + 2 = x^2 - 3x + 2 ).Then, multiply that by ( (x - 3) ):( (x^2 - 3x + 2)(x - 3) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x^2 + 9x + 2x - 6 )Combine like terms:( x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ). Yep, that matches the original polynomial. So, my factoring is correct.Alright, moving on to the second part of the problem. The software allows users to enhance certain frequencies by doubling their amplitude. The initial amplitude at frequency ( x = 2 ) is given by the function ( g(x) = sqrt{x + 4} ). I need to calculate the new amplitude after doubling.First, let's find the initial amplitude at ( x = 2 ). Plugging into ( g(x) ):( g(2) = sqrt{2 + 4} = sqrt{6} ).So, the initial amplitude is ( sqrt{6} ). Doubling this amplitude would mean multiplying by 2:New amplitude = ( 2 times sqrt{6} = 2sqrt{6} ).But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The function ( g(x) ) gives the amplitude at a particular frequency ( x ). So, at ( x = 2 ), the amplitude is ( sqrt{6} ). If we double this, it's simply ( 2sqrt{6} ). Is there any chance that the function ( g(x) ) is being modified in another way? The problem says \\"enhance certain frequencies by doubling their amplitude.\\" So, it sounds like we just take the amplitude at that frequency and double it. So, yes, it's straightforward: multiply by 2.Just to be thorough, let me compute ( sqrt{6} ) approximately to see what the amplitude is. ( sqrt{4} = 2 ), ( sqrt{9} = 3 ), so ( sqrt{6} ) is approximately 2.449. Doubling that gives about 4.898. But since the problem doesn't specify needing a decimal approximation, leaving it as ( 2sqrt{6} ) is fine.So, summarizing the steps:1. Found the roots of ( f(x) ) by factoring, resulting in ( x = 1, 2, 3 ).2. Calculated the initial amplitude at ( x = 2 ) using ( g(2) = sqrt{6} ).3. Doubled the amplitude to get ( 2sqrt{6} ).I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, but let me just go through it again quickly.For the first part, using the Rational Root Theorem was the right approach, and testing ( x = 1 ) worked. Then, synthetic division correctly factored out ( (x - 1) ), leaving a quadratic that factored neatly into ( (x - 2)(x - 3) ). So, roots at 1, 2, 3.For the second part, plugging ( x = 2 ) into ( g(x) ) gives ( sqrt{6} ), doubling it is straightforward. No complications here.So, I feel confident about these answers.**Final Answer**1. The frequencies where the sound wave produces no sound are boxed{1}, boxed{2}, and boxed{3}.2. The new amplitude after doubling is boxed{2sqrt{6}}."},{"question":"Dr. Nakamura, a retired physics professor and former colleague of the Nobel laureate Yoichiro Nambu, is revisiting one of his favorite physics problems involving the behavior of particles in a potential field. During his analysis, he encounters a mathematical expression that needs simplification and solution.1. Simplify the following radical expression, inspired by a model for potential energy in a quantum system:   [   sqrt{18x^2y} + sqrt{50xy^3}   ]2. After simplifying, Dr. Nakamura notices that the expression must be set equal to zero to find a critical point in the system. Solve the equation formed by setting your simplified expression equal to zero, assuming ( x neq 0 ) and ( y neq 0 ).","answer":"Alright, so Dr. Nakamura has this problem about simplifying a radical expression and then solving it when set to zero. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, the expression given is:[sqrt{18x^2y} + sqrt{50xy^3}]Hmm, okay. I remember that simplifying radicals involves breaking down the numbers and variables into factors that are perfect squares or cubes, depending on the root. Since these are square roots, I should look for perfect square factors.Starting with the first term, (sqrt{18x^2y}). Let me break down 18. I know that 18 is 9 times 2, and 9 is a perfect square. So, I can write:[sqrt{18x^2y} = sqrt{9 times 2 times x^2 times y}]Now, since square roots of perfect squares can be taken out of the radical, I can separate them:[sqrt{9} times sqrt{x^2} times sqrt{2y}]Calculating those square roots, (sqrt{9} = 3) and (sqrt{x^2} = x), so:[3x times sqrt{2y}]So, the first term simplifies to (3xsqrt{2y}).Moving on to the second term, (sqrt{50xy^3}). Let's factor 50. I know that 50 is 25 times 2, and 25 is a perfect square. So,[sqrt{50xy^3} = sqrt{25 times 2 times x times y^3}]Again, taking out the perfect squares. (sqrt{25} = 5), and for the variables, (y^3) can be written as (y^2 times y), so (sqrt{y^2} = y). Therefore,[5y times sqrt{2x}]Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. The term inside the radical is (2x), right? Because we have (2 times x) left after taking out (y^2). So, yes, it's (5ysqrt{2x}).So, putting it all together, the original expression simplifies to:[3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x}]Hmm, can we factor anything else out? Both terms have a (sqrt{2}) in them. Let me see:First term: (3xsqrt{2y} = 3xsqrt{2}sqrt{y})Second term: (5ysqrt{2x} = 5ysqrt{2}sqrt{x})So, factoring out (sqrt{2}), we get:[sqrt{2}(3xsqrt{y} + 5ysqrt{x})]Is that the simplest form? I think so. Alternatively, we can write it as:[sqrt{2} left(3xsqrt{y} + 5ysqrt{x}right)]But maybe it's fine as it is. Alternatively, sometimes people prefer to rationalize or write in terms of combined radicals, but I don't think that's necessary here. So, I think the simplified form is:[3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x}]Wait, but let me double-check my factoring. If I factor out (sqrt{2}), then:[3xsqrt{2y} = 3x times sqrt{2} times sqrt{y}][5ysqrt{2x} = 5y times sqrt{2} times sqrt{x}]So, yes, factoring out (sqrt{2}) gives:[sqrt{2}(3xsqrt{y} + 5ysqrt{x})]But I think both forms are acceptable. Maybe the first form is simpler because it's just two terms with radicals, each simplified as much as possible.Okay, so moving on to the second part. Dr. Nakamura sets this expression equal to zero:[3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x} = 0]We need to solve this equation, assuming (x neq 0) and (y neq 0).Let me write this equation again:[3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x} = 0]Since both (x) and (y) are non-zero, we can divide both sides by (sqrt{2}) to simplify:[3xsqrt{y} + 5ysqrt{x} = 0]Hmm, okay. Let me factor out a common term if possible. Both terms have a (sqrt{x}) and a (sqrt{y}), but not exactly the same. Wait, let's see:Let me denote (a = sqrt{x}) and (b = sqrt{y}). Then, (x = a^2) and (y = b^2). Substituting into the equation:[3a^2 b + 5b^2 a = 0]So, that's:[3a^2 b + 5a b^2 = 0]Factor out an (a b):[a b (3a + 5b) = 0]So, since (a = sqrt{x}) and (b = sqrt{y}), and (x neq 0), (y neq 0), so (a neq 0), (b neq 0). Therefore, the product (a b) is not zero, so the other factor must be zero:[3a + 5b = 0]Substituting back (a = sqrt{x}) and (b = sqrt{y}):[3sqrt{x} + 5sqrt{y} = 0]Wait, but square roots are non-negative, right? So, (sqrt{x}) and (sqrt{y}) are both greater than or equal to zero. So, their linear combination with positive coefficients can only be zero if both (sqrt{x}) and (sqrt{y}) are zero. But (x) and (y) are non-zero, so this can't happen.Hmm, that's a problem. So, does this mean there is no solution?Wait, let me check my steps again.Original equation after simplifying:[3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x} = 0]Divide both sides by (sqrt{2}):[3xsqrt{y} + 5ysqrt{x} = 0]Let me rearrange terms:[3xsqrt{y} = -5ysqrt{x}]Since (x) and (y) are non-zero, I can divide both sides by (ysqrt{x}):[frac{3xsqrt{y}}{ysqrt{x}} = -5]Simplify the left side:[frac{3x}{y} times frac{sqrt{y}}{sqrt{x}} = 3 times frac{x}{y} times sqrt{frac{y}{x}} = 3 times frac{sqrt{x}}{sqrt{y}} times sqrt{frac{y}{x}} = 3 times sqrt{frac{x}{y} times frac{y}{x}} = 3 times sqrt{1} = 3]Wait, that simplifies to 3, so:[3 = -5]That's not possible. So, this suggests that there is no solution where (x neq 0) and (y neq 0).But that seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution or the factoring.Let me go back to the equation:[3xsqrt{y} + 5ysqrt{x} = 0]Let me factor out (sqrt{x}sqrt{y}):[sqrt{x}sqrt{y}(3sqrt{x} + 5sqrt{y}) = 0]Since (x neq 0) and (y neq 0), (sqrt{x}sqrt{y} neq 0), so again:[3sqrt{x} + 5sqrt{y} = 0]Which, as before, implies that both (sqrt{x}) and (sqrt{y}) are negative, which is impossible because square roots are non-negative. Therefore, there is no solution with (x neq 0) and (y neq 0).Wait, but the problem says to solve the equation assuming (x neq 0) and (y neq 0). So, does that mean there is no solution? Or did I make a mistake in simplifying the radicals?Let me double-check the simplification.Original expression:[sqrt{18x^2y} + sqrt{50xy^3}]First term: (sqrt{18x^2y})18 factors into 9*2, so:[sqrt{9*2*x^2*y} = sqrt{9}sqrt{x^2}sqrt{2y} = 3xsqrt{2y}]That seems correct.Second term: (sqrt{50xy^3})50 factors into 25*2, and (y^3 = y^2*y), so:[sqrt{25*2*x*y^2} = sqrt{25}sqrt{y^2}sqrt{2x} = 5ysqrt{2x}]That also seems correct.So, the simplified expression is indeed (3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x}), which we set to zero:[3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x} = 0]Dividing both sides by (sqrt{2}):[3xsqrt{y} + 5ysqrt{x} = 0]As before, which leads to a contradiction because the left side is a sum of non-negative terms multiplied by positive coefficients, which can't be zero unless both terms are zero, which isn't allowed.Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no solution with (x neq 0) and (y neq 0).But wait, maybe I should consider the possibility that (x) and (y) could be negative? Because if (x) or (y) are negative, the square roots would involve imaginary numbers, but the problem didn't specify whether we're dealing with real numbers or complex.Hmm, the problem mentions a potential energy in a quantum system, which typically deals with real numbers, so probably we're restricted to real numbers here. Therefore, (x) and (y) must be positive to have real square roots.So, in the realm of real numbers, there's no solution where (x neq 0) and (y neq 0).Alternatively, if we consider complex numbers, but that complicates things, and I don't think that's intended here.So, perhaps the answer is that there is no solution under the given conditions.Wait, but the problem says to solve the equation, so maybe I missed something.Let me try another approach. Let's square both sides of the equation to eliminate the radicals, but I have to be careful because squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.Starting from:[3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x} = 0]Let me move one term to the other side:[3xsqrt{2y} = -5ysqrt{2x}]Now, square both sides:[(3xsqrt{2y})^2 = (-5ysqrt{2x})^2]Calculating both sides:Left side: (9x^2 * 2y = 18x^2y)Right side: (25y^2 * 2x = 50x y^2)So, equation becomes:[18x^2y = 50x y^2]Divide both sides by (x y) (since (x neq 0), (y neq 0)):[18x = 50y]Simplify:[9x = 25y]So, (x = frac{25}{9} y)Now, let's substitute this back into the original equation to check for extraneous solutions.Original equation:[3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x} = 0]Substitute (x = frac{25}{9} y):First term: (3 * frac{25}{9} y * sqrt{2y} = frac{75}{9} y sqrt{2y} = frac{25}{3} y sqrt{2y})Second term: (5y * sqrt{2 * frac{25}{9} y} = 5y * sqrt{frac{50}{9} y} = 5y * frac{sqrt{50}}{3} sqrt{y} = 5y * frac{5sqrt{2}}{3} sqrt{y} = frac{25sqrt{2}}{3} y sqrt{y})So, the equation becomes:[frac{25}{3} y sqrt{2y} + frac{25sqrt{2}}{3} y sqrt{y} = 0]Factor out (frac{25}{3} y sqrt{y}):[frac{25}{3} y sqrt{y} ( sqrt{2} + sqrt{2} ) = 0]Simplify inside the parentheses:[sqrt{2} + sqrt{2} = 2sqrt{2}]So, equation becomes:[frac{25}{3} y sqrt{y} * 2sqrt{2} = 0]Which simplifies to:[frac{50sqrt{2}}{3} y sqrt{y} = 0]Since (y neq 0), this equation can't be satisfied. Therefore, even after squaring, we don't get a valid solution. So, there is indeed no solution with (x neq 0) and (y neq 0).Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no solution under the given conditions.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.We had (x = frac{25}{9} y). Let me plug this back into the equation before squaring.Original equation:[3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x} = 0]Substitute (x = frac{25}{9} y):First term: (3 * frac{25}{9} y * sqrt{2y} = frac{75}{9} y sqrt{2y} = frac{25}{3} y sqrt{2y})Second term: (5y * sqrt{2 * frac{25}{9} y} = 5y * sqrt{frac{50}{9} y} = 5y * frac{sqrt{50}}{3} sqrt{y} = 5y * frac{5sqrt{2}}{3} sqrt{y} = frac{25sqrt{2}}{3} y sqrt{y})So, equation becomes:[frac{25}{3} y sqrt{2y} + frac{25sqrt{2}}{3} y sqrt{y} = 0]Factor out (frac{25}{3} y sqrt{y}):[frac{25}{3} y sqrt{y} ( sqrt{2} + sqrt{2} ) = 0]Which is:[frac{25}{3} y sqrt{y} * 2sqrt{2} = 0]Again, since (y neq 0), this can't be zero. So, no solution.Therefore, the answer is that there is no solution with (x neq 0) and (y neq 0).But wait, the problem says to solve the equation, so maybe the only solution is (x = 0) and (y = 0), but the problem excludes that. So, indeed, no solution exists under the given constraints.So, summarizing:1. The simplified expression is (3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x}).2. Setting this equal to zero and solving leads to a contradiction, implying no solution exists with (x neq 0) and (y neq 0).**Final Answer**The simplified expression is (boxed{3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x}}), and there is no solution for (x neq 0) and (y neq 0).However, since the problem asks to solve the equation, and we found no solution, perhaps the answer is that no solution exists. But in the context of the problem, maybe expressing it as no solution.But the instructions say to put the final answer in a box. Since the first part is the simplified expression, and the second part is solving, which has no solution, perhaps the final answer is just the simplified expression, but the problem also asks to solve it.Wait, the problem has two parts: 1) simplify, 2) solve. So, the final answers are two parts. The first is the simplified expression, the second is the solution.But since the solution is no solution, perhaps we can write that as well.But the instructions say to put the final answer within boxes. Maybe two separate boxes.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the simplified expression and then the conclusion that no solution exists.But in the initial problem, it's two separate questions: 1) simplify, 2) solve. So, I think the final answers are:1. Simplified expression: (boxed{3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x}})2. No solution exists, so perhaps (boxed{text{No solution}})But I'm not sure if that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe expressing it as (x = 0) and (y = 0), but the problem excludes that.Alternatively, maybe the solution is (x = 0) and (y = 0), but since they are excluded, no solution.But the problem says to assume (x neq 0) and (y neq 0), so the answer is no solution.So, perhaps:1. (boxed{3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x}})2. (boxed{text{No solution}})But I'm not sure if the second part is supposed to be in a box. The original problem says \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\". Maybe both parts in separate boxes.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the simplified expression and then the relation between x and y, but since that leads to a contradiction, maybe just stating no solution.I think the best way is to present both answers as above.**Final Answer**1. The simplified expression is (boxed{3xsqrt{2y} + 5ysqrt{2x}}).2. There is no solution with (x neq 0) and (y neq 0), so the solution is (boxed{text{No solution}})."},{"question":"As a newly hired junior product manager, you are tasked with analyzing the demand for a new product in the market.

Determine the price ( p ) at which the demand for the product is maximized. 2. You are also asked to ensure the demand stays above 35 units. Find the range of prices ( p ) that keeps the demand above 35 units.","answer":"Alright, so I just got this problem about analyzing the demand for a new product. It's a quadratic equation, which I remember from algebra class. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, the problem says that the demand D(p) is given by the equation D(p) = -3p² + 12p + 20. I need to find the price p that maximizes the demand. Hmm, okay. Since it's a quadratic equation, and the coefficient of p² is negative (-3), I know the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola is the maximum point. So, the vertex will give me the price where the demand is the highest.I remember there's a formula to find the vertex of a parabola. For a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is at -b/(2a). In this case, a is -3 and b is 12. Let me plug those values into the formula.So, p = -b/(2a) = -12/(2*(-3)) = -12/(-6) = 2. So, the price p that maximizes the demand is 2. That seems straightforward. Let me just double-check my calculation. -12 divided by (2 times -3) is indeed 2. Yep, that looks right.Now, moving on to the second part. I need to find the range of prices p that keeps the demand above 35 units. So, I have to solve the inequality D(p) > 35. Let me write that out:-3p² + 12p + 20 > 35First, I'll subtract 35 from both sides to bring everything to one side:-3p² + 12p + 20 - 35 > 0Simplifying that, 20 - 35 is -15, so:-3p² + 12p - 15 > 0Hmm, okay. So, I have a quadratic inequality here. Let me write it as:-3p² + 12p - 15 > 0It might be easier if I factor out a negative sign to make the coefficient of p² positive. Let me factor out -3:-3(p² - 4p + 5) > 0Wait, hold on. If I factor out -3, the inequality sign will flip because I'm multiplying both sides by a negative number. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I should just divide both sides by -3, remembering to flip the inequality sign.So, starting again:-3p² + 12p - 15 > 0Divide both sides by -3 (and reverse the inequality):p² - 4p + 5 < 0Hmm, now I have p² - 4p + 5 < 0. Let me see if this quadratic can be factored or if I need to find its roots.Looking at p² - 4p + 5, I can try to compute the discriminant to see if it has real roots. The discriminant is b² - 4ac = (-4)² - 4*1*5 = 16 - 20 = -4. Since the discriminant is negative, this quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis and doesn't have real roots. That means p² - 4p + 5 is always positive because the coefficient of p² is positive. So, p² - 4p + 5 is always greater than 0, which means the inequality p² - 4p + 5 < 0 has no solution.Wait, that can't be right because the original inequality was D(p) > 35, which should have some solutions. Maybe I made a mistake in my algebra.Let me go back. The original inequality was:-3p² + 12p + 20 > 35Subtract 35:-3p² + 12p - 15 > 0Instead of factoring out -3, maybe I should just solve the quadratic equation -3p² + 12p - 15 = 0 to find the critical points.Let me write that equation:-3p² + 12p - 15 = 0I can multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:3p² - 12p + 15 = 0Now, let's compute the discriminant for this equation:D = (-12)² - 4*3*15 = 144 - 180 = -36Again, the discriminant is negative, which means there are no real roots. So, the quadratic 3p² - 12p + 15 is always positive because the coefficient of p² is positive. Therefore, 3p² - 12p + 15 > 0 for all real p, which implies that -3p² + 12p - 15 < 0 for all real p.Wait, so going back to the inequality -3p² + 12p - 15 > 0, since the quadratic is always negative, this inequality is never true. That would mean there's no price p where the demand is above 35 units. But that doesn't make sense because when p=2, the demand is maximized. Let me compute D(2):D(2) = -3*(2)^2 + 12*2 + 20 = -12 + 24 + 20 = 32 units.Hmm, so the maximum demand is 32 units, which is less than 35. So, actually, the demand never exceeds 35 units. Therefore, there is no range of prices where the demand stays above 35 units. That's why the inequality has no solution.But wait, let me double-check my calculation for D(2). Maybe I made a mistake there.D(2) = -3*(4) + 24 + 20 = -12 + 24 + 20 = 32. Yeah, that's correct. So, the maximum demand is 32, which is below 35. Therefore, the demand can never be above 35 units, regardless of the price. So, the range of prices p that keeps the demand above 35 units is empty.But the problem says, \\"ensure the demand stays above 35 units.\\" If it's impossible, then maybe there's a mistake in my approach. Let me check my steps again.Starting from D(p) > 35:-3p² + 12p + 20 > 35Subtract 35:-3p² + 12p - 15 > 0Multiply both sides by -1 (and reverse inequality):3p² - 12p + 15 < 0Compute discriminant:D = 144 - 180 = -36Since discriminant is negative, 3p² - 12p + 15 is always positive, so 3p² - 12p + 15 < 0 has no solution. Therefore, the original inequality -3p² + 12p - 15 > 0 has no solution. So, indeed, the demand never exceeds 35 units. Therefore, there's no price range where demand stays above 35.But wait, maybe I should check the maximum demand again. If the maximum demand is 32, as I calculated, then it's impossible for the demand to be above 35. So, the answer to part 2 is that there is no such range of prices.Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the original equation again. It says D(p) = -3p² + 12p + 20. Yes, that's correct. So, plugging p=2, D(2)=32. So, the maximum demand is 32, which is below 35. Therefore, the demand can never be above 35. So, the range is empty.But perhaps the problem expects me to find where D(p) >= 35, but even then, it's still impossible. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra when solving the inequality.Wait, let me try solving the inequality again without flipping the inequality sign.Starting with:-3p² + 12p + 20 > 35Subtract 35:-3p² + 12p - 15 > 0Let me factor this quadratic. Let's see if it can be factored.Looking for two numbers that multiply to (-3)*(-15)=45 and add up to 12. Hmm, 15 and 3. But 15 + 3 = 18, which is not 12. Maybe it's not factorable. Alternatively, I can use the quadratic formula to find the roots.Quadratic formula: p = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)Here, a = -3, b = 12, c = -15So,p = [-12 ± sqrt(144 - 4*(-3)*(-15))]/(2*(-3))Compute discriminant:sqrt(144 - 180) = sqrt(-36). Oh, so again, the discriminant is negative, meaning no real roots. So, the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis, and since the coefficient of p² is negative, the quadratic opens downward, meaning it's always negative. Therefore, -3p² + 12p - 15 is always negative, so the inequality -3p² + 12p - 15 > 0 has no solution.Therefore, the demand never exceeds 35 units, so there's no price range where demand stays above 35.Wait, but maybe I should consider that the demand can be above 35 for some p, but since the maximum is 32, it's impossible. So, the answer is that no such prices exist.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check the original equation again. D(p) = -3p² + 12p + 20. Yes, that's correct. So, plugging p=0, D(0)=20. p=1, D(1)= -3 +12 +20=29. p=2, D(2)=32. p=3, D(3)= -27 +36 +20=29. p=4, D(4)= -48 +48 +20=20. So, the demand peaks at p=2 with 32 units, and decreases on either side. So, indeed, the demand never reaches 35.Therefore, the range of prices where demand is above 35 is empty. So, part 2 has no solution.But wait, the problem says \\"ensure the demand stays above 35 units.\\" Maybe I should consider that the demand can be above 35 for some p, but since the maximum is 32, it's impossible. So, the answer is that there is no such range.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to find where D(p) is above 35, but since it's impossible, I should state that no such prices exist.So, to summarize:1. The price p that maximizes demand is 2.2. There is no range of prices where the demand stays above 35 units because the maximum demand is 32 units.But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate D(2):-3*(2)^2 + 12*2 + 20 = -12 + 24 + 20 = 32. Correct.And the quadratic equation when setting D(p)=35:-3p² + 12p + 20 = 35-3p² + 12p -15 =0Multiply by -1: 3p² -12p +15=0Discriminant: 144 - 180 = -36. Correct.So, no real solutions. Therefore, the demand never exceeds 35.So, I think my answers are correct."},{"question":"A respected scholar of literature, known for her keen eye in discovering promising new authors, is organizing a conference where each author will present their work.

Stern. The pavilion's roof is to be a parabolic arch, modeled by the quadratic function ( f(x) = -2x^2 + 8x + 10 ), where ( f(x) ) represents the height of the arch above the ground in feet, and ( x ) is the horizontal distance in feet from one end of the arch.1. Determine the maximum height of the arch and the distance from the starting point of the arch to where this maximum height occurs.2. The professor also wants to ensure that the height of the arch is at least 6 feet across a central span of the pavilion. Find the horizontal distance over which the height of the arch is at least 6 feet.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a parabolic arch modeled by the quadratic function ( f(x) = -2x^2 + 8x + 10 ). There are two parts to the problem. Let me try to tackle them one by one.Starting with the first part: Determine the maximum height of the arch and the distance from the starting point of the arch to where this maximum height occurs.Hmm, since it's a quadratic function, I remember that the graph of a quadratic function is a parabola. The coefficient of ( x^2 ) is -2, which is negative, so the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola is the highest point, which is the maximum height in this case.To find the vertex of a quadratic function in standard form ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ). Then, I can plug this back into the function to find the maximum height.Let me write down the values of a, b, and c from the given function:( a = -2 ), ( b = 8 ), ( c = 10 ).So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:( x = -frac{8}{2*(-2)} = -frac{8}{-4} = 2 ).So, the maximum height occurs at ( x = 2 ) feet from the starting point.Now, to find the maximum height, I substitute ( x = 2 ) back into the function:( f(2) = -2*(2)^2 + 8*(2) + 10 ).Calculating step by step:First, ( (2)^2 = 4 ).Then, ( -2*4 = -8 ).Next, ( 8*2 = 16 ).So, adding them up: ( -8 + 16 + 10 ).( -8 + 16 = 8 ).Then, ( 8 + 10 = 18 ).So, the maximum height is 18 feet.Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me double-check my calculations.( f(2) = -2*(4) + 16 + 10 = -8 + 16 + 10 = 18 ). Yeah, that's correct.So, part 1 is done: maximum height is 18 feet at 2 feet from the starting point.Moving on to part 2: The professor wants the height of the arch to be at least 6 feet across a central span. I need to find the horizontal distance over which the height is at least 6 feet.So, essentially, I need to find the values of x where ( f(x) geq 6 ).That means solving the inequality ( -2x^2 + 8x + 10 geq 6 ).Let me rewrite this inequality:( -2x^2 + 8x + 10 - 6 geq 0 )Simplify:( -2x^2 + 8x + 4 geq 0 )Hmm, so I have a quadratic inequality here. To solve this, I can first find the roots of the equation ( -2x^2 + 8x + 4 = 0 ), and then determine the intervals where the quadratic is positive or negative.Alternatively, I can factor or use the quadratic formula. Let me try the quadratic formula.The quadratic is ( -2x^2 + 8x + 4 = 0 ).Let me write it as ( 2x^2 - 8x - 4 = 0 ) by multiplying both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of ( x^2 ) positive. That might make calculations easier.So, ( 2x^2 - 8x - 4 = 0 ).Divide all terms by 2 to simplify:( x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0 ).Now, using the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ).Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -4 ), ( c = -2 ).So,( x = frac{-(-4) pm sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4*1*(-2)}}{2*1} )Simplify:( x = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 + 8}}{2} )( x = frac{4 pm sqrt{24}}{2} )Simplify ( sqrt{24} ) as ( 2sqrt{6} ), so:( x = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{6}}{2} )Divide numerator and denominator by 2:( x = 2 pm sqrt{6} )So, the roots are ( x = 2 + sqrt{6} ) and ( x = 2 - sqrt{6} ).Since ( sqrt{6} ) is approximately 2.449, so:( x = 2 + 2.449 approx 4.449 )and( x = 2 - 2.449 approx -0.449 )But since x represents the horizontal distance from one end of the arch, it can't be negative. So, we can ignore the negative root.Wait, but the quadratic equation was transformed. Let me think.Originally, the inequality was ( -2x^2 + 8x + 4 geq 0 ). When I multiplied both sides by -1, the inequality sign flips, so it becomes ( 2x^2 - 8x - 4 leq 0 ). But I think I might have confused myself here.Wait, no. Let me clarify.Starting from ( -2x^2 + 8x + 4 geq 0 ).I can factor out a -2:( -2(x^2 - 4x - 2) geq 0 ).Divide both sides by -2, remembering to flip the inequality sign:( x^2 - 4x - 2 leq 0 ).So, the inequality is ( x^2 - 4x - 2 leq 0 ).We found the roots of ( x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0 ) as ( x = 2 pm sqrt{6} ).Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive, the parabola opens upward. So, the quadratic is less than or equal to zero between its roots.Therefore, the solution to ( x^2 - 4x - 2 leq 0 ) is ( x in [2 - sqrt{6}, 2 + sqrt{6}] ).But since ( 2 - sqrt{6} ) is approximately -0.449, which is negative, and x cannot be negative in this context, the relevant interval is from 0 to ( 2 + sqrt{6} ).Wait, hold on. Let me think again.The original quadratic inequality is ( -2x^2 + 8x + 4 geq 0 ). So, the parabola opens downward (since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is negative). Therefore, the graph is a downward opening parabola, which is above the x-axis (i.e., ( f(x) geq 0 )) between its two roots.So, the roots are at ( x = 2 - sqrt{6} ) and ( x = 2 + sqrt{6} ). Since the parabola opens downward, the inequality ( -2x^2 + 8x + 4 geq 0 ) holds between these two roots.But ( 2 - sqrt{6} ) is approximately -0.449, which is negative, so in the context of the problem, x starts at 0. Therefore, the interval where the height is at least 6 feet is from x = 0 to x = ( 2 + sqrt{6} ).Wait, but hold on. Let me verify.If I plug in x = 0 into the original function, ( f(0) = -2*(0)^2 + 8*(0) + 10 = 10 ), which is greater than 6. So, the arch starts at 10 feet high, goes up to 18 feet at x = 2, and then comes back down.So, the height is above 6 feet from x = 0 up to some point where it crosses 6 feet again.But when I solved the equation ( f(x) = 6 ), I found roots at approximately x = -0.449 and x = 4.449. But since x cannot be negative, the relevant crossing point is at x ≈ 4.449.Therefore, the arch is above 6 feet from x = 0 to x ≈ 4.449.But wait, the problem says \\"across a central span\\". Hmm, maybe I need to find the interval where the height is at least 6 feet, which is symmetric around the vertex?Wait, no, the parabola isn't symmetric in terms of the starting point. Since the vertex is at x = 2, the arch is 18 feet high there, and it goes down on both sides.But since x starts at 0, the arch is 10 feet high at x = 0, goes up to 18 at x = 2, then comes back down to 6 feet at x ≈ 4.449.So, the span where the height is at least 6 feet is from x = 0 to x ≈ 4.449, which is a distance of approximately 4.449 feet.But wait, that's not symmetric. Wait, but the quadratic is symmetric around x = 2, so the distance from x = 2 to x ≈ 4.449 is the same as from x = 2 to x ≈ -0.449. But since x can't be negative, the span is only from x = 0 to x ≈ 4.449.But the problem says \\"across a central span\\". Maybe it's referring to the central part where the height is above 6 feet, which would be from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6). But since x can't be negative, the actual span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). So, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) - 0 = 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me think again. If the professor wants the height to be at least 6 feet across a central span, it's likely referring to the region around the vertex where the height is above 6 feet. But since the arch starts at x = 0, the region where it's above 6 feet is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). So, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But wait, sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, so 2 + sqrt(6) is approximately 4.449 feet. So, the span is about 4.449 feet.But let me verify by plugging in x = 4.449 into the original function:( f(4.449) = -2*(4.449)^2 + 8*(4.449) + 10 ).Calculating:First, ( (4.449)^2 ≈ 19.8 ).Then, ( -2*19.8 ≈ -39.6 ).Next, ( 8*4.449 ≈ 35.592 ).Adding up: ( -39.6 + 35.592 + 10 ≈ (-39.6 + 35.592) + 10 ≈ (-4.008) + 10 ≈ 5.992 ), which is approximately 6 feet. So, that checks out.Similarly, at x = 0, f(0) = 10, which is above 6.So, the height is at least 6 feet from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). Therefore, the horizontal distance over which the height is at least 6 feet is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But wait, the question says \\"the horizontal distance over which the height of the arch is at least 6 feet.\\" So, is it the length from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet? Or is it the distance between the two points where f(x) = 6, which would be from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), but since x can't be negative, the span is from 0 to 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Alternatively, if the professor is considering the entire span where the height is above 6 feet, regardless of starting point, it would be from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), but since x can't be negative, the actual span is 2 + sqrt(6) - 0 = 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Wait, but the problem says \\"across a central span\\". So, maybe it's referring to the central part where the height is above 6 feet, which would be symmetric around the vertex. But since the arch starts at x = 0, the central span can't extend beyond x = 0. So, the central span where the height is above 6 feet is from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), but since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). Therefore, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me think again. If I consider the entire parabola, without considering the starting point, the height is above 6 feet from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6). However, since the arch starts at x = 0, the portion from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6) is where the height is above 6 feet. Therefore, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Alternatively, if the professor is considering the entire span where the height is above 6 feet, regardless of the starting point, it would be from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), but since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). So, the distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Wait, but the problem says \\"across a central span\\". So, maybe it's referring to the span around the vertex where the height is above 6 feet, which would be from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6). But since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). So, the distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Alternatively, perhaps the professor wants the span where the height is above 6 feet, which is the entire region from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). So, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me calculate 2 + sqrt(6) exactly. sqrt(6) is irrational, so we can leave it as is or approximate it.But the problem might expect an exact value, so 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Wait, but let me think again about the inequality.We had ( -2x^2 + 8x + 10 geq 6 ), which simplifies to ( -2x^2 + 8x + 4 geq 0 ).We found the roots at x = 2 ± sqrt(6). So, the parabola is above 6 feet between these two roots. But since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6).Therefore, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me confirm by plugging in x = 2 + sqrt(6) into the original function:( f(2 + sqrt(6)) = -2*(2 + sqrt(6))^2 + 8*(2 + sqrt(6)) + 10 ).First, expand ( (2 + sqrt(6))^2 = 4 + 4*sqrt(6) + 6 = 10 + 4*sqrt(6) ).So,( f(2 + sqrt(6)) = -2*(10 + 4*sqrt(6)) + 16 + 8*sqrt(6) + 10 ).Calculate term by term:-2*10 = -20-2*4*sqrt(6) = -8*sqrt(6)Then, +16, +8*sqrt(6), +10.So, adding all together:-20 -8*sqrt(6) +16 +8*sqrt(6) +10.Simplify:(-20 +16 +10) + (-8*sqrt(6) +8*sqrt(6)).Which is:6 + 0 = 6.So, yes, at x = 2 + sqrt(6), the height is exactly 6 feet.Therefore, the height is at least 6 feet from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). So, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But wait, the problem says \\"the horizontal distance over which the height of the arch is at least 6 feet.\\" So, is it the length from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet? Or is it the distance between the two points where f(x) = 6, which would be 2*sqrt(6) feet?Wait, no. The distance between x = 2 - sqrt(6) and x = 2 + sqrt(6) is 2*sqrt(6). But since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me think again. If the professor is considering the entire span where the height is above 6 feet, regardless of the starting point, it would be from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is a distance of 2*sqrt(6) feet. However, since the arch starts at x = 0, the portion from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6) is where the height is above 6 feet, which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But the problem says \\"across a central span\\". So, maybe it's referring to the central part where the height is above 6 feet, which would be symmetric around the vertex. But since the arch starts at x = 0, the central span can't extend beyond x = 0. So, the central span where the height is above 6 feet is from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), but since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). Therefore, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Alternatively, perhaps the professor is considering the entire span where the height is above 6 feet, which would be from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), but since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). So, the distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me think about the wording again: \\"the horizontal distance over which the height of the arch is at least 6 feet.\\" So, it's the total distance where the height is above 6 feet. Since the arch starts at x = 0, and the height is above 6 feet until x = 2 + sqrt(6), the total distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Alternatively, if we consider the entire parabola, the height is above 6 feet from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is a distance of 2*sqrt(6) feet. But since the arch starts at x = 0, the span where the height is above 6 feet is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Wait, but 2*sqrt(6) is approximately 4.899, which is more than 4.449. Wait, no, 2*sqrt(6) is approximately 4.899, but 2 + sqrt(6) is approximately 4.449. Wait, that can't be. Wait, sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, so 2 + sqrt(6) is approximately 4.449, and 2*sqrt(6) is approximately 4.899.Wait, so if the span is from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), that's a distance of 2*sqrt(6), which is about 4.899 feet. But since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is about 4.449 feet.But the problem says \\"across a central span\\". So, maybe it's referring to the central part where the height is above 6 feet, which would be symmetric around the vertex. But since the arch starts at x = 0, the central span can't extend beyond x = 0. So, the central span where the height is above 6 feet is from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), but since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). Therefore, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Alternatively, perhaps the professor is considering the entire span where the height is above 6 feet, which would be from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), but since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). So, the distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But wait, let me think about the definition of \\"span\\". In architecture, a span is typically the distance between two supports. In this case, the arch starts at x = 0, and the other end would be where the arch meets the ground, which is when f(x) = 0.Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the other end. It just says the arch is modeled by this quadratic function, starting at x = 0. So, the arch starts at x = 0, goes up to the vertex at x = 2, and then comes back down. But where does it meet the ground again? Let me find the roots of the original function.Set f(x) = 0:( -2x^2 + 8x + 10 = 0 ).Multiply both sides by -1:( 2x^2 - 8x - 10 = 0 ).Divide by 2:( x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0 ).Using quadratic formula:( x = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 20)] / 2 = [4 ± sqrt(36)] / 2 = [4 ± 6]/2.So, roots are:( x = (4 + 6)/2 = 10/2 = 5 ),and( x = (4 - 6)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1 ).So, the arch meets the ground at x = -1 and x = 5. But since x can't be negative, the arch spans from x = 0 to x = 5 feet.Therefore, the total span of the arch is 5 feet.But the problem is asking for the horizontal distance over which the height is at least 6 feet. So, from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is approximately 4.449 feet. So, the distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But wait, the total span is 5 feet, so the distance where the height is at least 6 feet is 2 + sqrt(6) feet, which is approximately 4.449 feet, leaving a small portion near x = 5 where the height is below 6 feet.Therefore, the answer is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me write that in exact terms.So, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Alternatively, if the problem expects the distance between the two points where f(x) = 6, which are x = 2 - sqrt(6) and x = 2 + sqrt(6), the distance would be 2*sqrt(6). But since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But wait, 2*sqrt(6) is approximately 4.899, which is more than 4.449, which is 2 + sqrt(6). So, that can't be. Wait, no, 2*sqrt(6) is approximately 4.899, but 2 + sqrt(6) is approximately 4.449. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2*sqrt(6) is larger than 2 + sqrt(6). Wait, no, sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, so 2*sqrt(6) is approximately 4.899, and 2 + sqrt(6) is approximately 4.449. So, 2*sqrt(6) is larger.But in our case, the span where the height is above 6 feet is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 4.449 feet. So, the distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Wait, but if we consider the entire parabola, the span where the height is above 6 feet is from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2*sqrt(6) feet. But since the arch starts at x = 0, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.So, the answer is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me think again. The problem says \\"the horizontal distance over which the height of the arch is at least 6 feet.\\" So, it's the length of the interval where f(x) >= 6. Since f(x) >= 6 from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), but since x can't be negative, the interval is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). Therefore, the distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Alternatively, if the problem is considering the entire span where the height is above 6 feet, regardless of the starting point, it would be 2*sqrt(6) feet. But since the arch starts at x = 0, the span is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Wait, but 2*sqrt(6) is approximately 4.899, which is more than the total span of the arch, which is 5 feet. So, that can't be. Wait, no, the total span is 5 feet, so 2*sqrt(6) is about 4.899, which is less than 5. So, it's possible.Wait, but the arch is from x = 0 to x = 5. The height is above 6 feet from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6) ≈ 4.449, and from x = 2 - sqrt(6) ≈ -0.449 to x = 2 + sqrt(6) ≈ 4.449. But since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x ≈ 4.449.Therefore, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me think about the exact wording: \\"the horizontal distance over which the height of the arch is at least 6 feet.\\" So, it's the length of the interval where f(x) >= 6. Since the arch starts at x = 0, and the height is above 6 feet until x = 2 + sqrt(6), the distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Alternatively, if the problem is considering the entire span where the height is above 6 feet, regardless of the starting point, it would be 2*sqrt(6) feet. But since the arch starts at x = 0, the span is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Wait, but 2*sqrt(6) is approximately 4.899, which is less than the total span of 5 feet. So, the height is above 6 feet for approximately 4.899 feet, but since the arch starts at x = 0, the span is from x = 0 to x ≈ 4.449, which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:The quadratic equation f(x) = 6 has roots at x = 2 ± sqrt(6). So, the parabola is above 6 feet between these two roots. Since the arch starts at x = 0, the span where the height is above 6 feet is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). Therefore, the distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Yes, that makes sense. So, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Therefore, the answers are:1. Maximum height is 18 feet at x = 2 feet.2. The horizontal distance over which the height is at least 6 feet is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me write the exact values without approximating.So, for part 2, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But wait, let me check if the problem expects the distance between the two points where f(x) = 6, which would be 2*sqrt(6). But since the arch starts at x = 0, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Alternatively, if the problem is considering the central span, it might be referring to the distance between the two points where f(x) = 6, which is 2*sqrt(6) feet. But since the arch starts at x = 0, the central span where the height is above 6 feet is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Wait, but the central span would be symmetric around the vertex. So, the distance from the vertex to each side where f(x) = 6 is sqrt(6). So, the total span is 2*sqrt(6). But since the arch starts at x = 0, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.I think the correct interpretation is that the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet because the arch starts at x = 0, and the height is above 6 feet from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6).Therefore, the answers are:1. Maximum height: 18 feet at x = 2 feet.2. Horizontal distance: 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me write the exact values.So, for part 2, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.But let me think again. If I consider the entire span where the height is above 6 feet, it's from x = 2 - sqrt(6) to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2*sqrt(6) feet. But since the arch starts at x = 0, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6), which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Wait, but 2*sqrt(6) is approximately 4.899, which is less than the total span of 5 feet. So, the height is above 6 feet for approximately 4.899 feet, but since the arch starts at x = 0, the span is from x = 0 to x ≈ 4.449, which is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me just stick with the mathematical solution.The inequality ( -2x^2 + 8x + 10 geq 6 ) simplifies to ( -2x^2 + 8x + 4 geq 0 ), which has roots at x = 2 ± sqrt(6). The parabola opens downward, so the inequality holds between the roots. Since x can't be negative, the span is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(6). Therefore, the horizontal distance is 2 + sqrt(6) feet.Yes, that seems correct.So, final answers:1. Maximum height is 18 feet at 2 feet from the starting point.2. The horizontal distance over which the height is at least 6 feet is 2 + sqrt(6) feet."},{"question":"In the 1980s, a Zimbabwean athlete was known for her impressive speed on the track. During one of her international races, she competed in the 400-meter dash, finishing with a time that could be modeled by a quadratic equation based on her acceleration and initial speed.1. If her speed ( v(t) ) in meters per second at time ( t ) seconds can be described by the quadratic function ( v(t) = -0.5t^2 + 4t + 3 ), find the time ( t ) in seconds when her speed was exactly 6 meters per second. Solve the quadratic equation to find ( t ).2. The athlete's coach also measured her speed at different intervals and noticed that her speed could be expressed as a rational expression: ( s(t) = frac{3t + 12}{t + 2} ). Simplify the expression for ( s(t) ) and determine any restrictions on the variable ( t ).","answer":"Okay, so I have these two math problems about a Zimbabwean athlete from the 1980s. Let me try to figure them out step by step.Starting with the first problem: Her speed ( v(t) ) is given by the quadratic function ( v(t) = -0.5t^2 + 4t + 3 ). I need to find the time ( t ) when her speed was exactly 6 meters per second. Hmm, so I guess I set ( v(t) = 6 ) and solve for ( t ).Let me write that equation down:( -0.5t^2 + 4t + 3 = 6 )Hmm, okay, so I can subtract 6 from both sides to set the equation to zero:( -0.5t^2 + 4t + 3 - 6 = 0 )Simplifying that:( -0.5t^2 + 4t - 3 = 0 )Hmm, quadratic equations can sometimes be tricky, especially with the decimal coefficient. Maybe I can eliminate the decimal by multiplying the entire equation by 2. Let's try that:Multiplying each term by 2:( -1t^2 + 8t - 6 = 0 )So that simplifies to:( -t^2 + 8t - 6 = 0 )Alternatively, I can write it as:( t^2 - 8t + 6 = 0 )Wait, because if I multiply both sides by -1, the signs will flip. Let me check:Original equation after multiplying by 2: ( -t^2 + 8t - 6 = 0 )Multiplying by -1: ( t^2 - 8t + 6 = 0 ). Yeah, that seems right.Now, I can use the quadratic formula to solve for ( t ). The quadratic formula is:( t = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )In this equation, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -8 ), and ( c = 6 ).Plugging those values in:( t = frac{-(-8) pm sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(1)(6)}}{2(1)} )Simplify step by step:First, compute the numerator:- The first term is ( -(-8) = 8 )- The discriminant ( b^2 - 4ac ) is ( 64 - 24 = 40 )- So the square root of 40 is ( sqrt{40} ). Let me simplify that: ( sqrt{40} = sqrt{4 times 10} = 2sqrt{10} )So putting it all together:( t = frac{8 pm 2sqrt{10}}{2} )I can factor out a 2 in the numerator:( t = frac{2(4 pm sqrt{10})}{2} )Cancel out the 2:( t = 4 pm sqrt{10} )So, the solutions are ( t = 4 + sqrt{10} ) and ( t = 4 - sqrt{10} ).Now, let me compute the numerical values to see if they make sense.First, ( sqrt{10} ) is approximately 3.1623.So, ( 4 + 3.1623 = 7.1623 ) seconds.And ( 4 - 3.1623 = 0.8377 ) seconds.Hmm, so the times when her speed was exactly 6 m/s are approximately 0.84 seconds and 7.16 seconds.But wait, in a 400-meter dash, the race duration is usually around 40-50 seconds for professional athletes. So, 7 seconds seems too short for a 400m dash. Maybe I made a mistake?Wait, no, the quadratic function models her speed over time, not the position. So, her speed could be 6 m/s at two different times: once when she's accelerating and once when she's decelerating. But in a 400m dash, she would accelerate initially, reach a maximum speed, then maybe slow down towards the end.But 7 seconds seems too short for a 400m race. Wait, maybe the function is only modeling a portion of the race? Or perhaps it's a 400-meter dash, but the function is for a different event? Hmm, maybe I don't need to worry about the real-world context here, just solve the math.So, mathematically, the solutions are ( t = 4 + sqrt{10} ) and ( t = 4 - sqrt{10} ). Both are positive times, so they are valid.Wait, ( 4 - sqrt{10} ) is approximately 0.8377 seconds, which is positive, so that's okay.So, I think that's the answer for the first part.Moving on to the second problem: The coach measured her speed as a rational expression ( s(t) = frac{3t + 12}{t + 2} ). I need to simplify this expression and determine any restrictions on ( t ).Alright, so let's see. The expression is ( frac{3t + 12}{t + 2} ). Maybe I can factor the numerator.Looking at the numerator: 3t + 12. I can factor out a 3:( 3(t + 4) )So, the expression becomes:( frac{3(t + 4)}{t + 2} )Hmm, can I cancel anything? The denominator is ( t + 2 ), and the numerator has ( t + 4 ). They don't have common factors, so I don't think I can simplify it further algebraically.Wait, unless I perform polynomial division or something. Let me try that.Divide ( 3t + 12 ) by ( t + 2 ).How many times does ( t + 2 ) go into ( 3t + 12 )?Well, ( t + 2 ) goes into ( 3t ) exactly 3 times, because 3*(t + 2) = 3t + 6.Subtracting that from the numerator:( (3t + 12) - (3t + 6) = 6 )So, the division gives 3 with a remainder of 6. Therefore, the expression can be written as:( 3 + frac{6}{t + 2} )So, ( s(t) = 3 + frac{6}{t + 2} )Is that a simpler form? Maybe, depending on what's required. But perhaps the original factored form is sufficient.But the problem says to simplify the expression, so maybe both forms are acceptable, but perhaps the polynomial plus a fraction is considered simpler.Additionally, I need to determine any restrictions on ( t ).In the original expression ( frac{3t + 12}{t + 2} ), the denominator cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined.So, ( t + 2 neq 0 ) implies ( t neq -2 ).So, the restriction is ( t neq -2 ).But in the context of the problem, ( t ) represents time in seconds. Time cannot be negative, so ( t ) must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, ( t = -2 ) is already outside the domain of the problem, so maybe it's not necessary to mention it as a restriction in the context, but mathematically, it's still a restriction.So, summarizing, the simplified expression is ( frac{3(t + 4)}{t + 2} ) or ( 3 + frac{6}{t + 2} ), with the restriction that ( t neq -2 ).But since time can't be negative, in the context of the problem, the only relevant restriction is ( t geq 0 ). However, mathematically, ( t ) cannot be -2 regardless.Wait, but the problem says \\"determine any restrictions on the variable ( t )\\", so I think it's expecting the mathematical restriction, which is ( t neq -2 ).So, putting it all together, the simplified expression is ( frac{3(t + 4)}{t + 2} ) with ( t neq -2 ).Alternatively, as ( 3 + frac{6}{t + 2} ), same restriction.I think either form is acceptable, but perhaps the factored form is preferable.So, to recap:1. For the first problem, solving ( -0.5t^2 + 4t + 3 = 6 ) leads to ( t = 4 pm sqrt{10} ), approximately 0.84 seconds and 7.16 seconds.2. For the second problem, simplifying ( frac{3t + 12}{t + 2} ) gives ( frac{3(t + 4)}{t + 2} ) with the restriction ( t neq -2 ).I think that covers both problems.**Final Answer**1. The times when her speed was exactly 6 meters per second are (boxed{4 - sqrt{10}}) seconds and (boxed{4 + sqrt{10}}) seconds.2. The simplified expression is (boxed{frac{3(t + 4)}{t + 2}}) with the restriction that ( t neq -2 )."},{"question":"As an art enthusiast inspired by Claude Monet's love for gardens, you decide to create a garden that emulates the beauty of Monet's famous Water Lilies series. You plan to design a rectangular water lily pond surrounded by a garden path of uniform width. The area of the pond alone is 96 square meters. The total area of the pond and the surrounding garden path is 180 square meters.1. If the length of the pond is 4 meters longer than its width, set up and solve a quadratic equation to determine the dimensions of the pond.2. Given that the garden path has a uniform width, find the width of the path by setting up and solving an appropriate equation.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about designing a garden inspired by Claude Monet. It involves a rectangular pond with water lilies and a surrounding garden path. The pond's area is 96 square meters, and the total area including the path is 180 square meters. The pond's length is 4 meters longer than its width. I need to find the dimensions of the pond and then the width of the path.Starting with part 1: finding the dimensions of the pond. Let me denote the width of the pond as ( w ) meters. Since the length is 4 meters longer than the width, the length would be ( w + 4 ) meters. The area of the pond is given by length multiplied by width, so that's ( w times (w + 4) = 96 ).Let me write that equation out:( w(w + 4) = 96 )Expanding this, it becomes:( w^2 + 4w = 96 )To form a quadratic equation, I need to bring all terms to one side:( w^2 + 4w - 96 = 0 )Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation. I can use the quadratic formula, which is ( w = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = 1 ), ( b = 4 ), and ( c = -96 ).Calculating the discriminant first:( b^2 - 4ac = 16 - 4(1)(-96) = 16 + 384 = 400 )So, the square root of 400 is 20. Plugging back into the quadratic formula:( w = frac{-4 pm 20}{2} )This gives two solutions:1. ( w = frac{-4 + 20}{2} = frac{16}{2} = 8 )2. ( w = frac{-4 - 20}{2} = frac{-24}{2} = -12 )Since width can't be negative, we discard -12. So, the width is 8 meters. Then, the length is ( 8 + 4 = 12 ) meters.Wait, let me double-check that. If width is 8, length is 12, area is 8*12=96. Yep, that's correct.Moving on to part 2: finding the width of the garden path. The total area including the path is 180 square meters. The pond is surrounded by a path of uniform width, let's denote this width as ( x ) meters.So, the total area would be the area of the pond plus the area of the path. But actually, it's easier to think of the total area as a larger rectangle that includes both the pond and the path. The dimensions of this larger rectangle would be the pond's dimensions plus twice the width of the path (since the path is on both sides).Therefore, the length of the larger rectangle is ( 12 + 2x ) meters, and the width is ( 8 + 2x ) meters. The area of this larger rectangle is 180 square meters.So, the equation is:( (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) = 180 )Let me expand this:First, multiply 12 by 8: 96Then, 12 by 2x: 24xThen, 2x by 8: 16xThen, 2x by 2x: 4x²So, adding all these together:96 + 24x + 16x + 4x² = 180Combine like terms:96 + 40x + 4x² = 180Bring all terms to one side:4x² + 40x + 96 - 180 = 0Simplify:4x² + 40x - 84 = 0I can divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:x² + 10x - 21 = 0Now, solving this quadratic equation. Again, using the quadratic formula, where ( a = 1 ), ( b = 10 ), ( c = -21 ).Discriminant:( b^2 - 4ac = 100 - 4(1)(-21) = 100 + 84 = 184 )Wait, 10 squared is 100, 4*1*21 is 84, so 100 + 84 is 184. Hmm, 184 is not a perfect square. Let me see if I can factor this equation.Looking for two numbers that multiply to -21 and add to 10. Hmm, 14 and -3? 14 * (-3) = -42, not -21. Wait, 7 and -3: 7*(-3)=-21, and 7 + (-3)=4, not 10. Hmm, maybe it doesn't factor nicely. So, I'll have to use the quadratic formula.So, ( x = frac{-10 pm sqrt{184}}{2} )Simplify sqrt(184). Let's see, 184 divided by 4 is 46, so sqrt(4*46)=2*sqrt(46). So, sqrt(184)=2*sqrt(46).Therefore, ( x = frac{-10 pm 2sqrt{46}}{2} ) which simplifies to ( x = -5 pm sqrt{46} ).Since width can't be negative, we take the positive solution:( x = -5 + sqrt{46} )Calculating sqrt(46) is approximately 6.782, so ( x ≈ -5 + 6.782 ≈ 1.782 ) meters.Wait, that seems a bit large for a garden path. Let me check my calculations again.Wait, when I set up the equation, I had (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) = 180. Let me verify that.Yes, because the path is on both sides, so each dimension increases by 2x. So, that part is correct.Expanding: 12*8=96, 12*2x=24x, 8*2x=16x, 2x*2x=4x². So, 96 + 40x + 4x²=180. Then, 4x² +40x -84=0, divide by 4: x² +10x -21=0. Correct.Quadratic formula: x = [-10 ± sqrt(100 +84)]/2 = [-10 ± sqrt(184)]/2. Correct.sqrt(184)=sqrt(4*46)=2*sqrt(46). So, x=(-10 + 2sqrt(46))/2= -5 + sqrt(46). Approximately, sqrt(46)=6.782, so 6.782-5=1.782 meters. So, about 1.78 meters.Is that reasonable? A path of almost 1.8 meters. Maybe, but let me think if I made a mistake in setting up the equation.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the area of the path separately. The total area is 180, the pond is 96, so the path area is 180 - 96 = 84 square meters.Alternatively, the area of the path can be calculated as the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the pond. So, (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) - 96 = 84.Wait, that's the same as before, because (12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) = 180, which is 96 + 84. So, same equation.Alternatively, maybe I can express the area of the path as the perimeter of the pond times the width of the path plus the area of the four corners, which are squares of x by x. Wait, that might be another way to calculate it.Let me try that approach.The area of the path can be calculated as:Area of path = (Perimeter of pond) * x + 4x²Because the path around the pond has a width of x, so the area is like the perimeter times x, but then the four corners where the paths overlap are counted twice, so we need to add 4x².Wait, actually, no. When you have a path around a rectangle, the area is (length + 2x)(width + 2x) - length*width. Which is the same as what I did before.But another way to think about it is:Area of path = 2*(length + width)*x + 4x²Which is the same as (perimeter)*x + 4x².So, let's compute that:Perimeter of pond = 2*(12 + 8) = 40 meters.So, area of path = 40x + 4x².We know the area of the path is 84 square meters.So, 4x² + 40x = 84Which simplifies to 4x² + 40x - 84 = 0, same as before. So, same equation.So, x² +10x -21=0, same quadratic.So, same solution: x = [-10 ± sqrt(100 +84)]/2 = [-10 ± sqrt(184)]/2.So, same result. So, x ≈1.782 meters.Hmm, so that seems consistent. Maybe it's correct. Although 1.78 meters is quite wide for a garden path, but perhaps in Monet's style, it's acceptable.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\\"The total area of the pond and the surrounding garden path is 180 square meters.\\"So, yes, that's the total area, which is the pond plus the path. So, my setup is correct.Alternatively, maybe the path is only on one side? But the problem says \\"surrounding garden path of uniform width,\\" which implies it's on all sides.So, I think my approach is correct.Therefore, the width of the path is sqrt(46) -5 meters, approximately 1.782 meters.But let me see if sqrt(46) is exact. Since 46 is 2*23, which doesn't have a square factor, so sqrt(46) is irrational, so the exact value is sqrt(46)-5.Alternatively, maybe I can write it as sqrt(46)-5, but perhaps the problem expects an exact value or a simplified radical form.So, sqrt(46) is already simplified, so the exact width is sqrt(46) -5 meters.Alternatively, maybe I can write it as (sqrt(46) -5) meters.But let me check if I can factor the quadratic equation x² +10x -21=0.Looking for two numbers that multiply to -21 and add to 10. Hmm, 14 and -3: 14*(-3)=-42, not -21. 7 and -3: 7*(-3)=-21, and 7 + (-3)=4, not 10. 21 and -1: 21*(-1)=-21, 21 + (-1)=20, not 10. So, it doesn't factor nicely, so quadratic formula is the way to go.Therefore, the width of the path is sqrt(46) -5 meters, approximately 1.782 meters.Wait, sqrt(46) is about 6.782, so 6.782 -5=1.782. So, yes.Alternatively, maybe I can rationalize or present it differently, but I think that's the simplest form.So, summarizing:1. The pond has width 8 meters and length 12 meters.2. The garden path has a width of sqrt(46) -5 meters, approximately 1.78 meters.I think that's the solution."},{"question":"A piano instructor is teaching a soprano about the relationships between different musical notes and frequencies. The instructor explains that if the frequency of a note is ( f ), the frequency of the note one octave higher is ( 2f ).1. Suppose the instructor gives the soprano a polynomial equation that represents the relationship between the fundamental frequency ( f ) and several harmonics: ( f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x ). If the soprano's target frequency for a certain piece is 440 Hz (the frequency of the A4 note), solve the equation ( f(x) = 440 ) for ( x ).2. The soprano also wants to ensure that her sight-reading skills stay sharp. The instructor suggests she practices reading music for a certain amount of time each day. If the instructor tells her that she should practice for a minimum of ( 20 ) minutes daily and no more than ( 60 ) minutes, express this requirement as an inequality and solve it for ( x ) where ( x ) represents the number of minutes she practices each day.","answer":"Alright, so I've got these two math problems to solve, both related to music and piano instruction. Let me take them one at a time and think through each step carefully.Starting with the first problem: The instructor gave a polynomial equation representing the relationship between the fundamental frequency ( f ) and several harmonics. The equation is ( f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x ). The soprano's target frequency is 440 Hz, which is the A4 note. I need to solve the equation ( f(x) = 440 ) for ( x ).Hmm, okay. So, essentially, I need to find the value(s) of ( x ) such that when I plug them into the polynomial ( x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x ), the result is 440. That means I have to solve the equation:( x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x = 440 )Let me rewrite this equation to set it equal to zero, which is the standard form for solving polynomials. So, subtract 440 from both sides:( x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 440 = 0 )Now, I have a cubic equation: ( x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 440 = 0 ). Solving cubic equations can be a bit tricky, but maybe I can factor this or use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible roots.The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction ( frac{p}{q} ), where ( p ) is a factor of the constant term and ( q ) is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -440, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are the factors of -440.Factors of 440 include: ±1, ±2, ±4, ±5, ±8, ±10, ±11, ±20, ±22, ±40, ±44, ±55, ±88, ±110, ±220, ±440.That's a lot of possible roots, but maybe I can test some of them to see if they satisfy the equation.Let me start by testing ( x = 10 ) because 10 is a nice round number and 440 is a multiple of 10.Plugging ( x = 10 ) into the equation:( 10^3 - 3(10)^2 + 2(10) - 440 = 1000 - 300 + 20 - 440 = (1000 - 300) + (20 - 440) = 700 - 420 = 280 ). Hmm, that's not zero. So, 10 is not a root.How about ( x = 8 )? Let's try that.( 8^3 - 3(8)^2 + 2(8) - 440 = 512 - 192 + 16 - 440 = (512 - 192) + (16 - 440) = 320 - 424 = -104 ). Still not zero, but closer.Next, ( x = 11 ):( 11^3 - 3(11)^2 + 2(11) - 440 = 1331 - 363 + 22 - 440 = (1331 - 363) + (22 - 440) = 968 - 418 = 550 ). That's way too high.How about ( x = 5 ):( 5^3 - 3(5)^2 + 2(5) - 440 = 125 - 75 + 10 - 440 = (125 - 75) + (10 - 440) = 50 - 430 = -380 ). Not zero either.Maybe ( x = 7 ):( 7^3 - 3(7)^2 + 2(7) - 440 = 343 - 147 + 14 - 440 = (343 - 147) + (14 - 440) = 196 - 426 = -230 ). Still negative.Wait, let's try ( x = 12 ):( 12^3 - 3(12)^2 + 2(12) - 440 = 1728 - 432 + 24 - 440 = (1728 - 432) + (24 - 440) = 1296 - 416 = 880 ). That's too high.Hmm, maybe ( x = 9 ):( 9^3 - 3(9)^2 + 2(9) - 440 = 729 - 243 + 18 - 440 = (729 - 243) + (18 - 440) = 486 - 422 = 64 ). Closer, but still not zero.Wait, so at ( x = 8 ), the value was -104, and at ( x = 9 ), it's 64. So, somewhere between 8 and 9, the function crosses zero. That suggests there's a real root between 8 and 9. But since we're dealing with a polynomial, there could be multiple roots.But maybe I should check if there's an integer root. Let me try ( x = 10 ) again, but that gave 280. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.Wait, let me recalculate ( x = 10 ):( 10^3 = 1000 )( 3x^2 = 3*(10)^2 = 3*100 = 300 )( 2x = 20 )So, ( 1000 - 300 + 20 - 440 = 1000 - 300 = 700; 700 + 20 = 720; 720 - 440 = 280 ). Yeah, that's correct. So, 10 is not a root.Wait, maybe I should try ( x = 14 ):( 14^3 = 2744 )( 3x^2 = 3*196 = 588 )( 2x = 28 )So, ( 2744 - 588 + 28 - 440 = 2744 - 588 = 2156; 2156 + 28 = 2184; 2184 - 440 = 1744 ). That's way too high.Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Perhaps I should factor the polynomial first before trying to find roots.Looking at ( f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x ), I can factor out an x:( f(x) = x(x^2 - 3x + 2) )Then, factor the quadratic:( x^2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 2) )So, the polynomial factors as:( f(x) = x(x - 1)(x - 2) )Ah, that's much simpler! So, the original equation is ( f(x) = x(x - 1)(x - 2) ). Therefore, setting ( f(x) = 440 ):( x(x - 1)(x - 2) = 440 )So, we have ( x(x - 1)(x - 2) = 440 ). Hmm, this is a cubic equation, and we need to find x such that the product of three consecutive integers (since x, x-1, x-2 are consecutive) is 440.Wait, but 440 is not a product of three consecutive integers. Let me check:Let me compute the product for x=8: 8*7*6=336x=9: 9*8*7=504So, 336 and 504. 440 is between them, so x must be between 8 and 9.But since x is between 8 and 9, it's not an integer. So, perhaps we need to solve it numerically.Alternatively, maybe I can write the equation as:( x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 440 = 0 )Since we know it's a cubic, it will have at least one real root. Let's try to approximate it.We can use methods like the Newton-Raphson method or trial and error.From earlier, at x=8: f(x)=-104At x=9: f(x)=64So, the root is between 8 and 9.Let me try x=8.5:( 8.5^3 = 614.125 )( 3x^2 = 3*(72.25) = 216.75 )( 2x = 17 )So, f(8.5) = 614.125 - 216.75 + 17 - 440 = 614.125 - 216.75 = 397.375; 397.375 +17=414.375; 414.375 -440= -25.625So, f(8.5)= -25.625We need f(x)=0. So, between 8.5 and 9.At x=8.5: -25.625At x=9: 64Let me try x=8.75:( 8.75^3 = 8.75*8.75*8.75 )First, 8.75*8.75=76.5625Then, 76.5625*8.75:Let me compute 76.5625*8=612.576.5625*0.75=57.421875So, total is 612.5 +57.421875=669.921875So, ( x^3=669.921875 )( 3x^2=3*(76.5625)=229.6875 )( 2x=17.5 )So, f(8.75)=669.921875 -229.6875 +17.5 -440Compute step by step:669.921875 -229.6875=440.234375440.234375 +17.5=457.734375457.734375 -440=17.734375So, f(8.75)=17.734375So, at x=8.75, f(x)=17.73We have:x=8.5: f=-25.625x=8.75: f=17.73We need to find x where f(x)=0 between 8.5 and 8.75.Let me use linear approximation.The change from x=8.5 to x=8.75 is 0.25, and the function changes from -25.625 to +17.73, which is a change of 17.73 - (-25.625)=43.355 over 0.25 interval.We need to find delta_x such that f(x)=0.From x=8.5, f=-25.625. We need to cover 25.625 to reach zero.So, delta_x= (25.625 /43.355)*0.25≈(0.591)*0.25≈0.1478So, approximate root at x=8.5 +0.1478≈8.6478Let me test x=8.65:Compute f(8.65):First, x=8.65x^3=8.65^3Compute 8^3=5120.65^3=0.274625But that's not helpful. Alternatively, compute step by step:8.65^2=74.8225Then, 8.65*74.8225Compute 8*74.8225=598.580.65*74.8225≈48.634625So, total≈598.58 +48.634625≈647.214625So, x^3≈647.2146253x^2=3*74.8225≈224.46752x=17.3So, f(x)=647.214625 -224.4675 +17.3 -440Compute step by step:647.214625 -224.4675≈422.747125422.747125 +17.3≈440.047125440.047125 -440≈0.047125So, f(8.65)≈0.047125, which is very close to zero.So, x≈8.65 is a root.To get a better approximation, let's do one more iteration.We have at x=8.65, f≈0.047At x=8.64:Compute x=8.64x^3=8.64^3First, 8.64^2=74.6496Then, 8.64*74.6496≈Compute 8*74.6496=597.19680.64*74.6496≈47.727744Total≈597.1968 +47.727744≈644.9245443x^2=3*74.6496≈223.94882x=17.28So, f(x)=644.924544 -223.9488 +17.28 -440Compute step by step:644.924544 -223.9488≈420.975744420.975744 +17.28≈438.255744438.255744 -440≈-1.744256So, f(8.64)≈-1.744So, between x=8.64 and x=8.65, f(x) goes from -1.744 to +0.047. So, the root is approximately at x=8.64 + (0 - (-1.744))/(0.047 - (-1.744)) * (8.65 -8.64)Compute the fraction: 1.744 / (0.047 +1.744)=1.744/1.791≈0.973So, delta_x≈0.973*0.01≈0.00973Thus, x≈8.64 +0.00973≈8.6497So, approximately x≈8.65Therefore, the real root is approximately 8.65.But wait, cubic equations can have up to three real roots. So, are there other roots?Given that the polynomial is ( x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x -440 =0 ), and we've found one real root near 8.65, let's factor this out to find the other roots.Using polynomial division or synthetic division.Let me use synthetic division with x≈8.65, but that might be messy. Alternatively, since we know one root is approximately 8.65, we can write the polynomial as (x - 8.65)(quadratic)=0But perhaps it's better to use the fact that we have one real root and factor it out.Alternatively, since the original polynomial is ( x(x -1)(x -2) =440 ), and we found x≈8.65, but perhaps there are other roots.Wait, but 440 is positive, and the product x(x-1)(x-2) is positive when x>2, since all three terms are positive. For x between 1 and 2, the product is negative, and for x<1, it's negative as well (since x is negative, x-1 is negative, x-2 is negative; product of three negatives is negative). So, the only real root is x≈8.65, because for x>2, the function increases to infinity, and since at x=8.65, it crosses 440, and beyond that, it keeps increasing.Therefore, the only real solution is x≈8.65.But let me check if there are other roots.Wait, the original equation is ( x^3 -3x^2 +2x -440=0 ). The derivative is ( 3x^2 -6x +2 ). Let's find critical points.Set derivative to zero:( 3x^2 -6x +2=0 )Using quadratic formula:x=(6±sqrt(36 -24))/6=(6±sqrt(12))/6=(6±2*sqrt(3))/6=1±(sqrt(3)/3)So, approximately, sqrt(3)=1.732, so sqrt(3)/3≈0.577Thus, critical points at x≈1.577 and x≈0.423.So, the function has a local maximum at x≈0.423 and a local minimum at x≈1.577.Let me compute the function at these points to see if there are other real roots.At x≈0.423:f(x)=0.423^3 -3*(0.423)^2 +2*(0.423) -440Compute:0.423^3≈0.07563*(0.423)^2≈3*0.1789≈0.53672*0.423≈0.846So, f(x)=0.0756 -0.5367 +0.846 -440≈(0.0756 -0.5367)= -0.4611; (-0.4611 +0.846)=0.3849; 0.3849 -440≈-439.615So, f(x)≈-439.615 at x≈0.423At x≈1.577:f(x)=1.577^3 -3*(1.577)^2 +2*(1.577) -440Compute:1.577^3≈3.9233*(1.577)^2≈3*(2.487)≈7.4612*1.577≈3.154So, f(x)=3.923 -7.461 +3.154 -440≈(3.923 -7.461)= -3.538; (-3.538 +3.154)= -0.384; (-0.384 -440)= -440.384So, f(x)≈-440.384 at x≈1.577So, the function has a local maximum at x≈0.423 of ≈-439.615 and a local minimum at x≈1.577 of ≈-440.384. Both are very close to -440, but slightly above and below.Wait, but our target is f(x)=440, which is positive. So, the function only crosses 440 once, at x≈8.65, because beyond that, it goes to infinity.Therefore, the only real solution is x≈8.65.But to express it more accurately, perhaps we can write it as a decimal or a fraction.Alternatively, maybe the equation can be solved exactly, but I don't think so because 440 is not a product of three consecutive integers, and the cubic doesn't factor nicely.So, the solution is approximately x≈8.65.But let me check if there's an exact solution. Maybe using the cubic formula, but that's quite involved.Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be rewritten as:( x^3 -3x^2 +2x -440=0 )Let me try to see if it can be factored as (x - a)(x^2 + bx + c)=0Expanding: x^3 + (b -a)x^2 + (c -ab)x -ac=0Comparing coefficients:b - a = -3c - ab = 2-ac = -440 => ac=440So, we have:1. b = a -32. c = ab +23. ac=440Substitute b from equation 1 into equation 2:c = a(a -3) +2 = a^2 -3a +2Then, from equation 3: a*(a^2 -3a +2)=440So, a^3 -3a^2 +2a -440=0Wait, that's the same as the original equation. So, this approach doesn't help.Therefore, it's not factorable by rational roots, so we have to rely on numerical methods.Thus, the solution is approximately x≈8.65.But let me check if 8.65 is accurate enough.Wait, earlier at x=8.65, f(x)=≈0.047, which is very close to zero. So, x≈8.65 is a good approximation.Alternatively, using more precise calculation:Let me use Newton-Raphson method starting from x0=8.65f(x)=x^3 -3x^2 +2x -440f'(x)=3x^2 -6x +2Compute f(8.65):As before,≈0.047f'(8.65)=3*(8.65)^2 -6*(8.65)+2Compute 8.65^2=74.8225So, 3*74.8225=224.46756*8.65=51.9So, f'(8.65)=224.4675 -51.9 +2=224.4675 -51.9=172.5675 +2=174.5675So, Newton-Raphson update:x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0)=8.65 - 0.047/174.5675≈8.65 -0.00027≈8.64973So, x≈8.64973Compute f(8.64973):x=8.64973x^3≈8.64973^3Compute 8.64973^2≈74.8225 (same as 8.65^2)Then, 8.64973*74.8225≈8*74.8225=598.58; 0.64973*74.8225≈48.6346Total≈598.58 +48.6346≈647.21463x^2≈3*74.8225≈224.46752x≈17.29946So, f(x)=647.2146 -224.4675 +17.29946 -440≈647.2146 -224.4675=422.7471; 422.7471 +17.29946≈440.04656; 440.04656 -440≈0.04656Wait, that's still about 0.04656, which is similar to before. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, actually, when I compute x=8.64973, it's very close to 8.65, so the function value is still approximately 0.04656, which is close to zero but not exactly zero. So, perhaps another iteration is needed.Compute f(8.64973)=≈0.04656f'(8.64973)=3*(8.64973)^2 -6*(8.64973)+2Compute (8.64973)^2≈74.82253*74.8225≈224.46756*8.64973≈51.8984So, f'(x)=224.4675 -51.8984 +2≈224.4675 -51.8984=172.5691 +2=174.5691Thus, x1=8.64973 -0.04656/174.5691≈8.64973 -0.000266≈8.649464Compute f(8.649464):x=8.649464x^3≈8.649464^3Again, x^2≈74.8225x^3≈8.649464*74.8225≈8*74.8225=598.58; 0.649464*74.8225≈48.6346Total≈598.58 +48.6346≈647.2146Same as before.Wait, but actually, since x is slightly less than 8.65, x^3 will be slightly less than 647.2146.But the difference is negligible for our purposes. So, perhaps we can accept x≈8.65 as the approximate solution.Therefore, the solution to the equation ( f(x)=440 ) is approximately x≈8.65.Moving on to the second problem: The soprano wants to ensure her sight-reading skills stay sharp. The instructor suggests she practices reading music for a certain amount of time each day. The requirement is a minimum of 20 minutes and a maximum of 60 minutes. Express this as an inequality and solve it for x, where x is the number of minutes she practices each day.So, the requirement is that x is at least 20 minutes and at most 60 minutes. In inequality terms, this is:20 ≤ x ≤ 60So, the inequality is 20 ≤ x ≤ 60.But the problem says to \\"solve it for x.\\" Since this is already solved for x, perhaps it's just expressing the range of x.Alternatively, if we consider it as an inequality to solve, it's already in the solved form, indicating that x must be between 20 and 60, inclusive.So, the solution is all real numbers x such that 20 ≤ x ≤ 60.But maybe the problem expects it to be written in interval notation or something else, but since it's specified as an inequality, 20 ≤ x ≤ 60 is sufficient.So, summarizing:1. The solution to ( f(x)=440 ) is approximately x≈8.65.2. The inequality representing the practice time is 20 ≤ x ≤ 60.**Final Answer**1. The solution is boxed{8.65}.2. The requirement is expressed as boxed{20 leq x leq 60}."},{"question":"A product designer is working on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface for a new mobile application.

Since S(x) is a polynomial, its derivative will be defined everywhere, so I just need to find where the derivative equals zero.First, let me compute the derivative of S(x). The derivative of -2x³ is -6x², the derivative of 9x² is 18x, the derivative of -12x is -12, and the derivative of the constant 5 is 0. So, putting it all together, S'(x) = -6x² + 18x - 12.Now, I need to find the values of x where S'(x) = 0. So, I set up the equation:-6x² + 18x - 12 = 0.Hmm, this is a quadratic equation. Maybe I can simplify it before solving. Let me factor out a common factor first. All the coefficients are divisible by -6, so let's factor that out:-6(x² - 3x + 2) = 0.Dividing both sides by -6 (which doesn't change the equality), we get:x² - 3x + 2 = 0.Now, I can factor this quadratic. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 2 and add to -3. Those numbers are -1 and -2. So, factoring:(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0.Setting each factor equal to zero gives x = 1 and x = 2. So, the critical points are at x = 1 and x = 2.Now, I need to determine which of these critical points is a maximum. Since the original function is a cubic polynomial with a negative leading coefficient (-2), it will tend to negative infinity as x approaches positive infinity and positive infinity as x approaches negative infinity. So, the graph of S(x) will have a local maximum and a local minimum.To figure out which critical point is which, I can use the second derivative test. Let's compute the second derivative S''(x).The first derivative was S'(x) = -6x² + 18x - 12. Taking the derivative of that, S''(x) = -12x + 18.Now, evaluate S''(x) at each critical point.First, at x = 1:S''(1) = -12(1) + 18 = -12 + 18 = 6. Since this is positive, the function is concave up at x = 1, which means it's a local minimum.Next, at x = 2:S''(2) = -12(2) + 18 = -24 + 18 = -6. Since this is negative, the function is concave down at x = 2, which means it's a local maximum.Therefore, the user satisfaction score is maximized at x = 2. So, the designer should include 2 interface elements to maximize satisfaction.Wait, hold on. That seems a bit low. Two interface elements? Let me double-check my calculations.Starting from the derivative: S'(x) = -6x² + 18x - 12. Setting that equal to zero:-6x² + 18x - 12 = 0.Divide both sides by -6: x² - 3x + 2 = 0. Factored as (x - 1)(x - 2) = 0, so x = 1 and x = 2. That seems correct.Second derivative: S''(x) = -12x + 18. At x = 1: 6, positive, so local min. At x = 2: -6, negative, so local max. So, x = 2 is indeed the local maximum. So, the function reaches its peak at x = 2.But let me think about the behavior of the function. Since it's a cubic with a negative leading coefficient, it goes from positive infinity to negative infinity. So, the local maximum at x = 2 is the highest point before the function starts decreasing towards negative infinity.But let me also check the value of S(x) at x = 2 to ensure it's a reasonable maximum.Calculating S(2):S(2) = -2(2)³ + 9(2)² - 12(2) + 5.Compute each term:-2*(8) = -16,9*(4) = 36,-12*(2) = -24,+5.So, adding them up: -16 + 36 = 20; 20 -24 = -4; -4 +5 = 1.So, S(2) = 1.Wait, that seems low. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.Wait, let's compute S(2) again:-2*(2)^3 = -2*8 = -16,9*(2)^2 = 9*4 = 36,-12*(2) = -24,+5.So, -16 + 36 is 20; 20 -24 is -4; -4 +5 is 1. So, yes, S(2) = 1.Hmm, that seems low. Maybe I should check S(1) as well.S(1) = -2(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 -12(1) +5 = -2 + 9 -12 +5.Compute step by step:-2 +9 = 7,7 -12 = -5,-5 +5 = 0.So, S(1) = 0.Wait, so at x = 1, S(x) is 0, and at x = 2, it's 1. So, the function is increasing from x = 1 to x = 2, but since it's a cubic, after x = 2, it starts decreasing.But if the maximum is at x = 2 with S(x) = 1, which is higher than S(1) = 0, but is that the global maximum?Wait, but considering the behavior of the cubic, as x approaches negative infinity, S(x) approaches positive infinity, and as x approaches positive infinity, it approaches negative infinity. So, the local maximum at x = 2 is actually the only local maximum, and it's the highest point on the graph.But in the context of the problem, x represents the number of interface elements, which can't be negative. So, x must be a positive integer, right? Or at least a positive real number, but in the context, it's probably an integer.So, if x is 2, that's the maximum. But let me check S(0) as well, just to see.S(0) = -2(0)^3 + 9(0)^2 -12(0) +5 = 5.So, at x = 0, S(x) is 5. Then it goes down to 0 at x =1, up to 1 at x =2, and then continues to decrease.Wait, so S(0) is 5, which is higher than S(2) =1. So, actually, the function starts at 5 when x=0, goes down to 0 at x=1, then up to 1 at x=2, and then continues to decrease from there.So, in that case, the maximum user satisfaction score is at x=0 with S(x)=5, but that's not practical because you can't have zero interface elements in a mobile app. So, the next point is x=1, but S(1)=0, which is worse. So, maybe the maximum within the practical range is at x=2 with S(x)=1, but that's still lower than S(0)=5.Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.Wait, the function is S(x) = -2x³ + 9x² -12x +5. Let me plot this function mentally.At x=0, S=5.At x=1, S=0.At x=2, S=1.At x=3, S= -2(27) + 9(9) -12(3) +5 = -54 +81 -36 +5 = (-54 +81)=27; (27 -36)= -9; (-9 +5)= -4.At x=4, S= -2(64) +9(16) -12(4)+5= -128 +144 -48 +5= (-128 +144)=16; (16 -48)= -32; (-32 +5)= -27.So, it's decreasing after x=2.Wait, so the function peaks at x=0 with S=5, then goes down to x=1 (S=0), then up to x=2 (S=1), then down again.So, in terms of critical points, x=1 is a local minimum, x=2 is a local maximum. But the local maximum at x=2 is still lower than the value at x=0.So, in terms of maximizing user satisfaction, the maximum is at x=0, but that's not practical because you can't have zero interface elements.So, the next best is x=2, which is a local maximum, but it's still lower than S(0). So, perhaps the function is designed such that adding more elements beyond a certain point decreases satisfaction, but the maximum satisfaction is actually at x=0, which is not practical.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing S(2). Let me recalculate S(2):-2*(2)^3 = -2*8 = -16,9*(2)^2 = 9*4 = 36,-12*(2) = -24,+5.So, -16 +36 = 20,20 -24 = -4,-4 +5 = 1.Yes, that's correct. So, S(2)=1.Wait, but that seems odd because the function starts at 5, goes down to 0 at x=1, up to 1 at x=2, then down again. So, the maximum satisfaction is at x=0, but that's not feasible.So, perhaps the designer needs to consider that the function is only valid for x >=1, since x=0 is not practical. In that case, the maximum would be at x=2, even though it's lower than S(0).Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to have a maximum at x=2, but it's just that S(0)=5 is higher. Maybe the function is only defined for x >=1.Wait, the problem says x represents the number of interface elements, so x must be a positive integer, probably starting from 1. So, x=1,2,3,...In that case, the maximum would be at x=2, since S(2)=1 is higher than S(1)=0 and S(3)=-4, etc.But S(2)=1 is still lower than S(0)=5, but since x=0 is not practical, x=2 is the best.Wait, but maybe I should check if there's a higher value somewhere else. Let's check x=1.5, which is halfway between 1 and 2.S(1.5) = -2*(1.5)^3 +9*(1.5)^2 -12*(1.5) +5.Compute each term:(1.5)^3 = 3.375,-2*3.375 = -6.75,(1.5)^2 = 2.25,9*2.25 = 20.25,-12*1.5 = -18,+5.So, adding up:-6.75 +20.25 =13.5,13.5 -18 = -4.5,-4.5 +5 =0.5.So, S(1.5)=0.5, which is less than S(2)=1.What about x=2.5?S(2.5) = -2*(15.625) +9*(6.25) -12*(2.5) +5.Compute each term:-2*15.625 = -31.25,9*6.25 =56.25,-12*2.5 =-30,+5.Adding up:-31.25 +56.25=25,25 -30= -5,-5 +5=0.So, S(2.5)=0.So, between x=2 and x=3, the function goes from 1 to -4, passing through 0 at x=2.5.So, the function is indeed decreasing after x=2.So, in the context of the problem, the maximum user satisfaction within the practical range (x >=1) is at x=2, even though it's lower than S(0)=5.Therefore, the answer to part 1 is x=2.Now, moving on to part 2: solving the inequality S(x) >5.So, we need to find the values of x for which -2x³ +9x² -12x +5 >5.First, let's subtract 5 from both sides to set the inequality to zero:-2x³ +9x² -12x +5 -5 >0,Simplify:-2x³ +9x² -12x >0.So, the inequality is -2x³ +9x² -12x >0.Let me factor this expression.First, factor out a common factor. All terms have a factor of -x, but let's see:-2x³ +9x² -12x = x(-2x² +9x -12).Alternatively, factor out a negative sign:= -x(2x² -9x +12).But let's see if 2x² -9x +12 can be factored.Looking for two numbers that multiply to 24 (2*12) and add to -9.Wait, 2x² -9x +12.Discriminant D = 81 - 96 = -15, which is negative, so it doesn't factor nicely. So, we can't factor it further with real numbers.Alternatively, let's factor out a -x:-2x³ +9x² -12x = -x(2x² -9x +12).So, the inequality becomes:-x(2x² -9x +12) >0.Let me write it as:(-x)(2x² -9x +12) >0.Now, to solve this inequality, we can analyze the sign of each factor.First, let's find the roots of the quadratic 2x² -9x +12.Using the quadratic formula:x = [9 ± sqrt(81 - 96)] /4 = [9 ± sqrt(-15)] /4.So, the quadratic has no real roots, which means it doesn't cross the x-axis. Since the coefficient of x² is positive (2), the quadratic is always positive.Therefore, 2x² -9x +12 >0 for all real x.So, the sign of the entire expression (-x)(positive) depends on the sign of -x.So, (-x)(positive) >0 is equivalent to -x >0, which is x <0.But x represents the number of interface elements, which must be a non-negative integer (or at least non-negative real number). So, x >=0.Therefore, the inequality (-x)(positive) >0 is only true when x <0, but since x >=0, there are no solutions in the domain of x.Wait, that can't be right because at x=0, S(x)=5, and the inequality is S(x) >5. So, S(0)=5, which is not greater than 5. So, the inequality S(x) >5 would require x such that S(x) >5.But according to our previous analysis, the function S(x) starts at 5 when x=0, then decreases to 0 at x=1, increases to 1 at x=2, then decreases again.So, the function never exceeds 5 except at x=0, where it's equal to 5. So, there are no x where S(x) >5.But let me double-check.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the inequality setup.Original inequality: S(x) >5.So, -2x³ +9x² -12x +5 >5.Subtract 5: -2x³ +9x² -12x >0.Factor: -x(2x² -9x +12) >0.Since 2x² -9x +12 is always positive, the sign of the expression depends on -x.So, -x >0 implies x <0.But x must be >=0, so no solution.Therefore, there is no x >=0 where S(x) >5.But wait, at x=0, S(x)=5, which is equal to 5, not greater. So, indeed, there are no x where S(x) >5.But that seems odd because the problem says the designer wants to limit the number of interface elements such that the user satisfaction score stays above 5. But according to this, it's impossible because S(x) never exceeds 5.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivative or the critical points.Wait, let me re-examine the function S(x) = -2x³ +9x² -12x +5.At x=0, S=5.At x=1, S=0.At x=2, S=1.At x=3, S=-4.So, the function peaks at x=0, then decreases, then increases a bit, then decreases again.So, the maximum value of S(x) is 5 at x=0, which is the highest point.Therefore, S(x) never exceeds 5. So, the inequality S(x) >5 has no solution.But the problem says the designer wants to limit the number of interface elements such that the user satisfaction score stays above 5. So, perhaps the designer wants to keep S(x) >=5, but in that case, x=0 is the only point where S(x)=5, but x=0 is not practical.Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have a different function where S(x) does exceed 5 somewhere.Wait, let me check the function again: S(x) = -2x³ +9x² -12x +5.Yes, that's correct.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivative.Wait, S'(x) = -6x² +18x -12, which we factored as -6(x² -3x +2) = -6(x-1)(x-2). So, critical points at x=1 and x=2.Second derivative: S''(x) = -12x +18.At x=1, S''(1)=6>0, so local min.At x=2, S''(2)=-6<0, so local max.So, S(2)=1, which is correct.So, the function indeed peaks at x=0 with S=5, then goes down, up a bit, then down again.Therefore, S(x) >5 has no solution because the function never exceeds 5.But the problem says the designer wants to limit the number of interface elements such that the user satisfaction score stays above 5. So, perhaps the designer needs to keep x=0, but that's not practical.Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to have a maximum above 5, but in this case, it doesn't.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing S(x) at x=0. Let me check:S(0) = -2(0)^3 +9(0)^2 -12(0) +5 = 5. Correct.So, the function starts at 5, goes down, then up a bit, then down again.Therefore, the inequality S(x) >5 has no solution.But the problem is asking to solve the inequality S(x) >5, so perhaps the answer is no solution.But let me think again. Maybe I misapplied the inequality.Wait, the inequality is S(x) >5, which is equivalent to -2x³ +9x² -12x +5 >5.Subtract 5: -2x³ +9x² -12x >0.Factor: -x(2x² -9x +12) >0.Since 2x² -9x +12 is always positive, the inequality reduces to -x >0, which is x <0.But x cannot be negative, so no solution.Therefore, the range of acceptable values for x is empty.But that seems odd because the problem is asking to find the range, implying there is a range.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in factoring.Let me try another approach.Let me write the inequality again:-2x³ +9x² -12x >0.Multiply both sides by -1 (remembering to reverse the inequality):2x³ -9x² +12x <0.Factor:x(2x² -9x +12) <0.Now, 2x² -9x +12 has discriminant D=81 -96= -15, so no real roots, and since the coefficient of x² is positive, 2x² -9x +12 >0 for all x.Therefore, the expression x(positive) <0.So, x <0.But x >=0, so no solution.Therefore, the inequality S(x) >5 has no solution.So, the designer cannot have any number of interface elements x >=0 where S(x) >5, except at x=0, where S(x)=5.Therefore, the acceptable range is empty.But that seems contradictory to the problem statement, which says the designer wants to limit the number of interface elements such that the satisfaction score stays above 5.Wait, maybe the problem is intended to have a different function, but as per the given function, this is the case.Alternatively, perhaps the inequality is S(x) >=5, in which case x=0 is the only solution, but x=0 is not practical.Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to have a maximum above 5, but in this case, it doesn't.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing S(x) at x=0. Let me check again:S(0) = -2(0)^3 +9(0)^2 -12(0) +5 = 5. Correct.So, the function starts at 5, goes down, then up a bit, then down again.Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no x >=0 where S(x) >5.Therefore, the answer to part 2 is that there are no solutions, or the range is empty.But the problem says \\"solve the inequality S(x) >5 to find the range of acceptable values for x.\\"So, perhaps the answer is no solution.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects complex solutions, but since x represents the number of interface elements, it must be a real number, and likely an integer.Therefore, the acceptable range is empty.But that seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake in the derivative or the critical points.Wait, let me check the derivative again.S(x) = -2x³ +9x² -12x +5.S'(x) = -6x² +18x -12.Set to zero: -6x² +18x -12=0.Divide by -6: x² -3x +2=0.Factor: (x-1)(x-2)=0, so x=1 and x=2.Second derivative: S''(x) = -12x +18.At x=1: 6>0, local min.At x=2: -6<0, local max.So, S(2)=1, which is correct.Therefore, the function peaks at x=0 with S=5, then decreases to x=1 (S=0), increases to x=2 (S=1), then decreases again.So, indeed, S(x) never exceeds 5.Therefore, the inequality S(x) >5 has no solution.So, the answer to part 2 is that there are no values of x for which S(x) >5.But the problem says \\"solve the inequality S(x) >5 to find the range of acceptable values for x.\\"So, perhaps the answer is no solution, or x ∈ ∅.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects x to be less than 0, but x cannot be negative.Therefore, the range is empty.So, summarizing:1. The number of interface elements that maximizes user satisfaction is x=2.2. There are no values of x for which S(x) >5, so the range is empty.But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the inequality setup.Wait, the inequality is S(x) >5, which is -2x³ +9x² -12x +5 >5.Subtract 5: -2x³ +9x² -12x >0.Factor: -x(2x² -9x +12) >0.Since 2x² -9x +12 is always positive, the inequality reduces to -x >0, which is x <0.But x cannot be negative, so no solution.Therefore, the answer is no solution.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects x to be in a certain interval, but given the function, it's not possible.Therefore, the final answers are:1. x=2.2. No solution.But let me check if the function could be S(x) = -2x³ +9x² -12x +5, and perhaps I made a mistake in computing S(x) at x=0.Wait, S(0)=5, correct.At x=0.5, let's compute S(0.5):-2*(0.125) +9*(0.25) -12*(0.5) +5.Compute each term:-2*0.125 = -0.25,9*0.25 =2.25,-12*0.5 =-6,+5.Adding up:-0.25 +2.25 =2,2 -6 =-4,-4 +5=1.So, S(0.5)=1.Wait, so at x=0.5, S(x)=1, which is less than 5.So, the function is decreasing from x=0 to x=1, then increasing to x=2, then decreasing again.Therefore, the function never exceeds 5 except at x=0.Therefore, the inequality S(x) >5 has no solution.So, the answer is:1. x=2.2. No solution.But the problem says \\"solve the inequality S(x) >5 to find the range of acceptable values for x.\\"So, perhaps the answer is no solution, or x ∈ ∅.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects complex solutions, but since x is the number of interface elements, it must be a real number, and likely an integer.Therefore, the acceptable range is empty.So, I think that's the conclusion."},{"question":"A local government official is devising a plan to promote the machine tool industry in China.

Determine the number of years, ( t ), after the start of the initiative when the demand for machine tools will be at its maximum. What is the maximum demand?2. The official wants to ensure that the demand stays above 30,000 units for as many years as possible. Find the range of years ( t ) when the demand is at least 30,000 units.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a local government official promoting the machine tool industry in China. They've given me a quadratic model for the demand, D(t) = -2t² + 12t + 20, where D(t) is in thousands of units and t is the number of years since the initiative started. There are two parts to this problem. Let me tackle them one by one.Starting with part 1: Determine the number of years, t, after the start of the initiative when the demand for machine tools will be at its maximum. What is the maximum demand?Hmm, okay. So, since this is a quadratic equation, and the coefficient of t² is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola is the maximum point. So, the vertex will give me both the time t when the demand is maximum and the maximum demand itself.I remember that for a quadratic equation in the form D(t) = at² + bt + c, the vertex occurs at t = -b/(2a). Let me write that down.Given D(t) = -2t² + 12t + 20, so a = -2, b = 12, c = 20.So, t = -b/(2a) = -12/(2*(-2)) = -12/(-4) = 3. So, t = 3 years.So, the maximum demand occurs at t = 3 years. Now, to find the maximum demand, I need to plug t = 3 back into the equation.Calculating D(3):D(3) = -2*(3)² + 12*(3) + 20.First, 3 squared is 9. So, -2*9 = -18.Then, 12*3 = 36.So, putting it all together: -18 + 36 + 20.Calculating step by step: -18 + 36 is 18, and 18 + 20 is 38.So, D(3) = 38, which is in thousands of units. So, the maximum demand is 38,000 units.Wait, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.D(3) = -2*(9) + 36 + 20.Yes, that's -18 + 36 + 20.-18 + 36 is indeed 18, and 18 + 20 is 38. So, that seems correct.Okay, so part 1 is done. The maximum demand occurs at 3 years, and it's 38,000 units.Moving on to part 2: The official wants to ensure that the demand stays above 30,000 units for as many years as possible. Find the range of years t when the demand is at least 30,000 units.Alright, so D(t) needs to be at least 30,000 units. Since D(t) is in thousands, that translates to D(t) ≥ 30.So, we need to solve the inequality: -2t² + 12t + 20 ≥ 30.Let me write that down:-2t² + 12t + 20 ≥ 30.First, let's subtract 30 from both sides to bring everything to one side:-2t² + 12t + 20 - 30 ≥ 0.Simplify that:-2t² + 12t - 10 ≥ 0.Hmm, okay. So, we have a quadratic inequality: -2t² + 12t - 10 ≥ 0.I think it's easier to work with positive coefficients, so maybe I can multiply both sides by -1. But wait, when I multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips.So, multiplying both sides by -1:2t² - 12t + 10 ≤ 0.So, now the inequality is 2t² - 12t + 10 ≤ 0.Now, let's try to solve this quadratic inequality. First, let's find the roots of the quadratic equation 2t² - 12t + 10 = 0.Using the quadratic formula: t = [12 ± sqrt( (-12)^2 - 4*2*10 )]/(2*2).Calculating discriminant:D = (-12)^2 - 4*2*10 = 144 - 80 = 64.So, sqrt(64) = 8.Thus, t = [12 ± 8]/4.So, two solutions:t = (12 + 8)/4 = 20/4 = 5.t = (12 - 8)/4 = 4/4 = 1.So, the roots are t = 1 and t = 5.Since the quadratic opens upwards (because the coefficient of t² is positive), the quadratic expression 2t² - 12t + 10 is ≤ 0 between its roots.So, the solution to 2t² - 12t + 10 ≤ 0 is t ∈ [1, 5].Therefore, the original inequality -2t² + 12t - 10 ≥ 0 is satisfied for t between 1 and 5, inclusive.So, the demand is at least 30,000 units from year 1 to year 5.But wait, let me double-check that.We started with D(t) ≥ 30, which is -2t² + 12t + 20 ≥ 30.Subtracting 30: -2t² + 12t -10 ≥ 0.Multiply by -1: 2t² -12t +10 ≤ 0.Quadratic opens upwards, so it's ≤ 0 between the roots t=1 and t=5.So, yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the range of years t is from 1 to 5 years.But just to make sure, let's test a value in each interval.The critical points are t=1 and t=5.So, intervals are:t < 1, say t=0:D(0) = -2*0 +12*0 +20 = 20, which is 20,000 units, which is less than 30,000. So, not in the solution.Between t=1 and t=5, say t=3:D(3) = 38,000 units, which is above 30,000. So, that's good.For t >5, say t=6:D(6) = -2*(36) +12*6 +20 = -72 +72 +20 = 20, which is again 20,000 units, below 30,000.So, yes, the demand is above 30,000 only between t=1 and t=5.Therefore, the range is t ∈ [1,5].So, summarizing:1. The maximum demand occurs at t=3 years, with a demand of 38,000 units.2. The demand stays above 30,000 units from year 1 to year 5.I think that's all. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.For part 1, since it's a quadratic with a negative leading coefficient, the vertex is the maximum. Calculated t=3, plugged back in, got 38. That seems solid.For part 2, set D(t) ≥30, converted it into an inequality, solved for t, found the roots at 1 and 5, tested intervals, confirmed the solution is between 1 and 5. That seems correct.I don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me just recheck the quadratic formula part.Original equation after moving 30: -2t² +12t -10 ≥0.Multiply by -1: 2t² -12t +10 ≤0.Quadratic formula: t = [12 ± sqrt(144 - 80)]/4 = [12 ±8]/4.So, 12+8=20, 20/4=5; 12-8=4, 4/4=1. Correct.So, roots at 1 and 5, quadratic opens upwards, so it's ≤0 between 1 and 5. Correct.Alright, I think I'm confident with these answers.**Final Answer**1. The maximum demand occurs at boxed{3} years, with a demand of boxed{38000} units.2. The demand is at least 30,000 units from year boxed{1} to year boxed{5}."},{"question":"A rival Ecuadorian politician is analyzing the economic impact of Raffo's proposed policy changes on the country's budget. Raffo claims that his policies will lead to a 10% increase in annual revenue, which the rival is skeptical about. The politician decides to model the situation using a quadratic equation to project future revenue growth.1. If the current revenue is represented by the variable ( R ), and the projected revenue according to Raffo's policy is given by the equation ( R(t) = R(1 + 0.1t - 0.005t^2) ), where ( t ) is the number of years after the implementation of the policy, find the value of ( t ) when the revenue is maximized. What is the maximum projected revenue in terms of ( R )?2. The politician believes that Raffo's policies will actually result in a linear revenue increase by only 5% per year. Write a linear equation to model this scenario, and determine the revenue after 5 years using this model.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about modeling revenue growth based on a politician's policy changes. It's split into two parts. Let me tackle them one by one.Starting with part 1: The revenue is modeled by the quadratic equation ( R(t) = R(1 + 0.1t - 0.005t^2) ). I need to find the value of ( t ) when the revenue is maximized and also determine the maximum projected revenue in terms of ( R ).Hmm, okay. Quadratic equations have the form ( at^2 + bt + c ), and their graphs are parabolas. Since the coefficient of ( t^2 ) here is negative (-0.005), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point. So, the vertex will give me the time ( t ) when the revenue is maximized.The general formula for the vertex of a parabola ( at^2 + bt + c ) is at ( t = -frac{b}{2a} ). Let me identify ( a ) and ( b ) from the equation.Looking at ( R(t) = R(1 + 0.1t - 0.005t^2) ), if I expand this, it's ( R + 0.1Rt - 0.005Rt^2 ). So, in terms of ( t ), the quadratic part is ( -0.005Rt^2 + 0.1Rt + R ). Therefore, ( a = -0.005R ) and ( b = 0.1R ).Wait, but actually, since we're looking for ( t ), maybe I should factor out ( R ) first. Let me rewrite the equation:( R(t) = R(1 + 0.1t - 0.005t^2) )So, the quadratic part inside the parentheses is ( 1 + 0.1t - 0.005t^2 ). So, in terms of ( t ), the quadratic is ( -0.005t^2 + 0.1t + 1 ). So, ( a = -0.005 ), ( b = 0.1 ), and ( c = 1 ).Therefore, the time ( t ) when revenue is maximized is at ( t = -frac{b}{2a} ).Plugging in the values:( t = -frac{0.1}{2 times -0.005} )Calculating the denominator first: ( 2 times -0.005 = -0.01 )So, ( t = -frac{0.1}{-0.01} )Dividing 0.1 by 0.01 gives 10, and the negatives cancel out, so ( t = 10 ).So, the revenue is maximized at ( t = 10 ) years.Now, to find the maximum projected revenue, I need to plug ( t = 10 ) back into the equation ( R(t) = R(1 + 0.1t - 0.005t^2) ).Calculating each term:First, ( 0.1t = 0.1 times 10 = 1 ).Second, ( 0.005t^2 = 0.005 times 100 = 0.5 ).So, plugging back in:( R(t) = R(1 + 1 - 0.5) = R(1.5) ).Therefore, the maximum revenue is ( 1.5R ), which is 50% higher than the current revenue ( R ).Wait, that seems quite high. Let me double-check my calculations.Starting with the quadratic equation:( R(t) = R(1 + 0.1t - 0.005t^2) )At ( t = 10 ):( 1 + 0.1(10) - 0.005(10)^2 = 1 + 1 - 0.5 = 1.5 )Yes, that's correct. So, the maximum revenue is indeed 1.5 times the current revenue ( R ).Alright, moving on to part 2. The rival politician believes the revenue increase is only 5% per year, which is linear. I need to write a linear equation for this and determine the revenue after 5 years.A linear model for revenue growth would be of the form ( R(t) = R + R times text{growth rate} times t ).Given that the growth rate is 5% per year, which is 0.05 in decimal.So, the equation would be:( R(t) = R + 0.05Rt )Simplifying, that's ( R(t) = R(1 + 0.05t) ).To find the revenue after 5 years, plug ( t = 5 ) into the equation:( R(5) = R(1 + 0.05 times 5) = R(1 + 0.25) = 1.25R ).So, after 5 years, the revenue would be 1.25 times the current revenue ( R ).Wait, let me just make sure I didn't confuse linear with exponential. But no, since it's a linear increase, it's additive each year, not multiplicative. So, each year, revenue increases by 5% of the original ( R ), not 5% of the previous year's revenue. So, yes, the linear model is correct.Alternatively, if it were exponential, it would be ( R(t) = R(1 + 0.05)^t ), but since the problem specifies a linear increase, it's additive.So, after 5 years, the revenue is 1.25R.Let me summarize:1. The revenue is maximized at ( t = 10 ) years, with a maximum revenue of ( 1.5R ).2. The linear model gives a revenue of ( 1.25R ) after 5 years.I think that covers both parts. I should probably write the final answers clearly.**Final Answer**1. The revenue is maximized after boxed{10} years, with a maximum projected revenue of boxed{1.5R}.2. The revenue after 5 years using the linear model is boxed{1.25R}."},{"question":"A renowned critic, famous for their disdain towards hero worship, is analyzing the impact of a popular hero-themed movie on its audience's perceptions. They decide to model the relationship between the amount of hero worship (denoted as ( H )) and the number of critical articles published about the movie (denoted as ( A )). The critic believes that the hero worship grows quadratically with time, following the model ( H(t) = at^2 + bt + c ), where ( t ) is the number of weeks since the movie's release, and ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are constants. Additionally, the critic notices that the number of critical articles published decreases linearly with the amount of hero worship, following the model ( A(H) = -mH + k ), where ( m ) and ( k ) are positive constants.1. If the critic observes that three weeks after the release, the hero worship level is 27, and six weeks after the release, it is 54, while initially (at ( t = 0 )), the hero worship level was 3, determine the quadratic function ( H(t) ).2. Assuming that initially, 50 critical articles were published, and the number of articles drops to 20 when the hero worship level reaches 60, find the linear function ( A(H) ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about modeling hero worship and critical articles. Let me try to figure this out step by step. First, part 1 is about finding the quadratic function ( H(t) = at^2 + bt + c ). They gave me some specific points: at ( t = 0 ), ( H = 3 ); at ( t = 3 ), ( H = 27 ); and at ( t = 6 ), ( H = 54 ). Alright, so since it's a quadratic function, I can plug these points into the equation to form a system of equations. Let's start with ( t = 0 ). Plugging that in, we get:( H(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = c = 3 ). So, ( c = 3 ). That was straightforward.Next, at ( t = 3 ), ( H = 27 ). Plugging that in:( 27 = a(3)^2 + b(3) + 3 ). Simplifying, that's ( 27 = 9a + 3b + 3 ). Subtract 3 from both sides: ( 24 = 9a + 3b ). Let me write that as equation (1): ( 9a + 3b = 24 ).Then, at ( t = 6 ), ( H = 54 ). Plugging that in:( 54 = a(6)^2 + b(6) + 3 ). Simplifying, ( 54 = 36a + 6b + 3 ). Subtract 3: ( 51 = 36a + 6b ). Let's call that equation (2): ( 36a + 6b = 51 ).Now, I have two equations:1. ( 9a + 3b = 24 )2. ( 36a + 6b = 51 )I can solve this system of equations. Let me try to simplify equation (1) first. If I divide equation (1) by 3, I get:( 3a + b = 8 ). Let's call this equation (1a): ( 3a + b = 8 ).Similarly, equation (2) can be simplified. If I divide equation (2) by 3, I get:( 12a + 2b = 17 ). Let's call this equation (2a): ( 12a + 2b = 17 ).Now, I can use equation (1a) to express ( b ) in terms of ( a ). From equation (1a):( b = 8 - 3a ).Now, substitute this into equation (2a):( 12a + 2(8 - 3a) = 17 ).Let me expand that:( 12a + 16 - 6a = 17 ).Combine like terms:( (12a - 6a) + 16 = 17 )  ( 6a + 16 = 17 ).Subtract 16 from both sides:( 6a = 1 ).So, ( a = frac{1}{6} ).Now, plug this back into equation (1a) to find ( b ):( 3*(1/6) + b = 8 )  ( 0.5 + b = 8 )  ( b = 8 - 0.5 )  ( b = 7.5 ) or ( frac{15}{2} ).So, now we have ( a = frac{1}{6} ), ( b = frac{15}{2} ), and ( c = 3 ). Therefore, the quadratic function is:( H(t) = frac{1}{6}t^2 + frac{15}{2}t + 3 ).Let me double-check these values with the given points.At ( t = 0 ):  ( H(0) = 0 + 0 + 3 = 3 ). Correct.At ( t = 3 ):  ( H(3) = frac{1}{6}(9) + frac{15}{2}(3) + 3 )  ( = 1.5 + 22.5 + 3 = 27 ). Correct.At ( t = 6 ):  ( H(6) = frac{1}{6}(36) + frac{15}{2}(6) + 3 )  ( = 6 + 45 + 3 = 54 ). Correct.Great, so part 1 seems solid.Moving on to part 2: finding the linear function ( A(H) = -mH + k ). They told us that initially, when ( H = 3 ), ( A = 50 ). And when ( H = 60 ), ( A = 20 ).So, we have two points: (3, 50) and (60, 20). Let me write them as:1. When ( H = 3 ), ( A = 50 ): ( 50 = -m*3 + k ).2. When ( H = 60 ), ( A = 20 ): ( 20 = -m*60 + k ).So, we can set up two equations:1. ( -3m + k = 50 ) (Equation 3)2. ( -60m + k = 20 ) (Equation 4)Now, subtract equation 3 from equation 4 to eliminate ( k ):( (-60m + k) - (-3m + k) = 20 - 50 )  ( (-60m + k + 3m - k) = -30 )  ( (-57m) = -30 ).So, ( -57m = -30 )  Divide both sides by -57:  ( m = frac{-30}{-57} = frac{30}{57} ).Simplify ( frac{30}{57} ): both are divisible by 3.  ( frac{10}{19} ).So, ( m = frac{10}{19} ).Now, plug this back into equation 3 to find ( k ):( -3*(10/19) + k = 50 )  ( -30/19 + k = 50 )  ( k = 50 + 30/19 ).Convert 50 to nineteenths:  50 = ( frac{950}{19} ).So, ( k = frac{950}{19} + frac{30}{19} = frac{980}{19} ).Simplify ( frac{980}{19} ):  19*51 = 969, so 980 - 969 = 11.  So, ( frac{980}{19} = 51 + frac{11}{19} ). But maybe it's better to leave it as ( frac{980}{19} ).So, the linear function is:( A(H) = -frac{10}{19}H + frac{980}{19} ).Let me verify this with the given points.At ( H = 3 ):  ( A = -frac{10}{19}*3 + frac{980}{19} )  ( = -frac{30}{19} + frac{980}{19} )  ( = frac{950}{19} = 50 ). Correct.At ( H = 60 ):  ( A = -frac{10}{19}*60 + frac{980}{19} )  ( = -frac{600}{19} + frac{980}{19} )  ( = frac{380}{19} = 20 ). Correct.Looks good. So, I think I've got both parts figured out.**Final Answer**1. The quadratic function is (boxed{H(t) = dfrac{1}{6}t^2 + dfrac{15}{2}t + 3}).2. The linear function is (boxed{A(H) = -dfrac{10}{19}H + dfrac{980}{19}})."},{"question":"As a court reporter in the British judiciary system, you need to transcribe and summarize court sessions that vary in length and complexity.

The owner has observed that the delivery time, ( t ), in hours, for their packages depends on the distance, ( d ), in miles, using the polynomial function ( t(d) = 0.05d^2 - 0.3d + 5 ). To minimize delivery time, the company is considering implementing a new delivery route.1. Find the distance ( d ) at which the delivery time is minimized by determining the vertex of the polynomial function ( t(d) ).2. Once the optimal distance is found, calculate the delivery time ( t ) for that distance.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where an e-commerce company wants to optimize their delivery time. They've given me a polynomial function that relates delivery time, t, in hours, to the distance, d, in miles. The function is t(d) = 0.05d² - 0.3d + 5. I need to find the distance d that minimizes the delivery time by determining the vertex of this function. Then, once I find that optimal distance, I have to calculate the corresponding delivery time t.Hmm, let me think. I remember that for quadratic functions, which are in the form of ax² + bx + c, the vertex can be found using the formula d = -b/(2a). Since this function is quadratic, I can apply that formula here. The vertex will give me the minimum or maximum point of the parabola. In this case, since the coefficient of d² is positive (0.05), the parabola opens upwards, meaning the vertex will be the minimum point. So, that should give me the distance where delivery time is minimized.Alright, let's identify the coefficients a, b, and c from the given function. The function is t(d) = 0.05d² - 0.3d + 5. So, a is 0.05, b is -0.3, and c is 5. Now, applying the vertex formula: d = -b/(2a). Plugging in the values, that would be d = -(-0.3)/(2*0.05). Let me compute that step by step. First, the numerator is -(-0.3), which is 0.3. The denominator is 2*0.05, which is 0.1. So, d = 0.3 / 0.1. That equals 3. So, the distance d at which the delivery time is minimized is 3 miles.Wait, 3 miles? That seems a bit short for a delivery route, but maybe it's correct given the function. Let me double-check my calculations. Starting again: a = 0.05, b = -0.3. So, d = -b/(2a) = -(-0.3)/(2*0.05) = 0.3 / 0.1 = 3. Yep, that's correct. So, 3 miles is where the minimum occurs.Now, moving on to the second part: calculating the delivery time t at this optimal distance. I need to plug d = 3 back into the function t(d).So, t(3) = 0.05*(3)² - 0.3*(3) + 5. Let me compute each term separately.First term: 0.05*(3)². 3 squared is 9, so 0.05*9 = 0.45.Second term: -0.3*(3) = -0.9.Third term: 5, which is just 5.Now, adding them all together: 0.45 - 0.9 + 5. Let me compute 0.45 - 0.9 first. That's -0.45. Then, adding 5: -0.45 + 5 = 4.55.So, the delivery time at 3 miles is 4.55 hours. Hmm, that seems a bit long for a 3-mile delivery, but again, maybe the function is designed that way. Let me verify my substitution.t(3) = 0.05*(9) - 0.3*(3) + 5 = 0.45 - 0.9 + 5. Yes, that's correct. 0.45 - 0.9 is indeed -0.45, and adding 5 gives 4.55 hours. So, that's accurate.Wait, 4.55 hours is like 4 hours and 33 minutes. That does seem quite a long time for a 3-mile delivery. Maybe the function isn't accounting for something, or perhaps it's a simplified model. But since the problem gives this function, I have to go with it.Let me recap: the function is a quadratic, opens upwards, vertex at d = 3 miles, which is the minimum point. Plugging d = 3 into the function gives t = 4.55 hours. So, that's the minimal delivery time.Is there another way to check this? Maybe by completing the square or using calculus? Since this is a quadratic, completing the square might be a good method to confirm.Let me try completing the square for the function t(d) = 0.05d² - 0.3d + 5.First, factor out the coefficient of d² from the first two terms:t(d) = 0.05(d² - 6d) + 5.Wait, because 0.05d² - 0.3d is 0.05(d² - (0.3/0.05)d) = 0.05(d² - 6d). Yes, that's correct.Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses, we take the coefficient of d, which is -6, divide by 2, giving -3, and square it, giving 9. So, we add and subtract 9 inside the parentheses:t(d) = 0.05[(d² - 6d + 9 - 9)] + 5= 0.05[(d - 3)² - 9] + 5= 0.05(d - 3)² - 0.05*9 + 5= 0.05(d - 3)² - 0.45 + 5= 0.05(d - 3)² + 4.55.So, in vertex form, the function is t(d) = 0.05(d - 3)² + 4.55. This confirms that the vertex is at (3, 4.55), which matches my earlier calculations. So, the minimal delivery time is indeed 4.55 hours at a distance of 3 miles.Alternatively, if I use calculus, I can take the derivative of t with respect to d, set it equal to zero, and solve for d. Let me try that as another verification.The function is t(d) = 0.05d² - 0.3d + 5. The derivative dt/dd is 0.1d - 0.3. Setting this equal to zero:0.1d - 0.3 = 00.1d = 0.3d = 0.3 / 0.1d = 3.So, again, we find that the critical point is at d = 3 miles. To ensure this is a minimum, we can check the second derivative. The second derivative of t with respect to d is 0.1, which is positive, confirming that the function is concave upwards and thus this critical point is indeed a minimum.Therefore, all methods—vertex formula, completing the square, and calculus—lead to the same conclusion: the minimal delivery time occurs at 3 miles, with a time of 4.55 hours.I think that's thorough enough. I've checked it multiple ways, so I'm confident in the results. The company should consider implementing a delivery route that minimizes the distance to approximately 3 miles to achieve the shortest possible delivery time of about 4.55 hours.**Final Answer**The optimal distance is boxed{3} miles, and the corresponding minimal delivery time is boxed{4.55} hours."},{"question":"For what smallest natural number ( a ) are there exactly 50 perfect squares in the numerical interval ( (a, 3a) )?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the smallest natural number ( a ) such that there are exactly 50 perfect squares in the interval ( (a, 3a) ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let's clarify what the interval ( (a, 3a) ) means. It's an open interval, so it doesn't include the endpoints ( a ) and ( 3a ). That means we're looking for perfect squares strictly greater than ( a ) and strictly less than ( 3a ).Now, a perfect square is a number of the form ( n^2 ) where ( n ) is a natural number. So, I need to find how many integers ( n ) satisfy ( a < n^2 < 3a ). The number of such ( n ) should be exactly 50.Let me denote ( n ) as the integer such that ( n^2 ) is a perfect square in the interval ( (a, 3a) ). So, the inequality becomes:[ a < n^2 < 3a ]I can rewrite this inequality to find bounds on ( n ). Taking square roots, we get:[ sqrt{a} < n < sqrt{3a} ]Since ( n ) has to be an integer, the number of integers between ( sqrt{a} ) and ( sqrt{3a} ) is 50. So, the number of integers ( n ) satisfying this is:[ lfloor sqrt{3a} - 1 rfloor - lceil sqrt{a} rceil + 1 = 50 ]Wait, let me make sure I have that right. The number of integers between two numbers ( x ) and ( y ) is ( lfloor y rfloor - lceil x rceil + 1 ). So, in this case, ( x = sqrt{a} ) and ( y = sqrt{3a} ). So, the number of integers ( n ) is:[ lfloor sqrt{3a} rfloor - lceil sqrt{a} rceil + 1 = 50 ]Yes, that seems correct. So, I need to find the smallest ( a ) such that this equation holds.Let me denote ( m = lceil sqrt{a} rceil ). Then, the next integer after ( sqrt{a} ) is ( m ), so ( m - 1 leq sqrt{a} < m ). Squaring all parts, we get:[ (m - 1)^2 leq a < m^2 ]Similarly, ( sqrt{3a} ) will be between some integers. Let me denote ( k = lfloor sqrt{3a} rfloor ), so ( k leq sqrt{3a} < k + 1 ). Squaring, we get:[ k^2 leq 3a < (k + 1)^2 ]So, from the number of integers, we have:[ k - m + 1 = 50 ]So, ( k = m + 49 )Therefore, ( k = m + 49 ). So, substituting back, we have:[ (m + 49)^2 leq 3a < (m + 50)^2 ]And:[ (m - 1)^2 leq a < m^2 ]So, combining these inequalities, we can write:[ (m + 49)^2 leq 3a < (m + 50)^2 ]And:[ (m - 1)^2 leq a < m^2 ]So, substituting ( a ) from the second inequality into the first, we get:[ (m + 49)^2 leq 3 times (m^2) ]And:[ 3 times ((m - 1)^2) < (m + 50)^2 ]Wait, let me think. Actually, the first inequality is ( (m + 49)^2 leq 3a ), and since ( a < m^2 ), then ( 3a < 3m^2 ). So, combining these:[ (m + 49)^2 leq 3m^2 ]Similarly, from the second inequality, ( 3a geq (m + 49)^2 ), and ( a geq (m - 1)^2 ), so:[ 3(m - 1)^2 geq (m + 49)^2 ]Wait, no. Let me correct that. The second inequality is ( a geq (m - 1)^2 ), so ( 3a geq 3(m - 1)^2 ). But we also have ( 3a < (m + 50)^2 ). So, combining these:[ 3(m - 1)^2 leq (m + 50)^2 ]So, now we have two inequalities:1. ( (m + 49)^2 leq 3m^2 )2. ( 3(m - 1)^2 leq (m + 50)^2 )These inequalities will help us find the range of ( m ) such that both are satisfied. Let me solve each inequality separately.Starting with the first inequality:[ (m + 49)^2 leq 3m^2 ]Expanding the left side:[ m^2 + 98m + 2401 leq 3m^2 ]Subtract ( m^2 + 98m + 2401 ) from both sides:[ 0 leq 2m^2 - 98m - 2401 ]Let me write this as:[ 2m^2 - 98m - 2401 geq 0 ]Divide both sides by 2:[ m^2 - 49m - 1200.5 geq 0 ]This is a quadratic inequality. Let me find the roots of the quadratic equation ( m^2 - 49m - 1200.5 = 0 ).Using the quadratic formula:[ m = frac{49 pm sqrt{49^2 + 4 times 1200.5}}{2} ]Calculate discriminant:[ D = 2401 + 4802 = 7203 ]Square root of 7203 is approximately 84.876.So, the roots are approximately:[ m = frac{49 pm 84.876}{2} ]Calculating the positive root:[ m = frac{49 + 84.876}{2} approx frac{133.876}{2} approx 66.938 ]And the negative root is negative, which we can ignore since ( m ) is a positive integer.So, the inequality ( m^2 - 49m - 1200.5 geq 0 ) holds when ( m geq 66.938 ). Since ( m ) is an integer, ( m geq 67 ).Now, moving on to the second inequality:[ 3(m - 1)^2 leq (m + 50)^2 ]Expanding both sides:Left side: ( 3(m^2 - 2m + 1) = 3m^2 - 6m + 3 )Right side: ( m^2 + 100m + 2500 )So, the inequality becomes:[ 3m^2 - 6m + 3 leq m^2 + 100m + 2500 ]Subtract ( 3m^2 - 6m + 3 ) from both sides:[ 0 leq -2m^2 + 106m + 2497 ]Multiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality):[ 2m^2 - 106m - 2497 leq 0 ]Again, solving the quadratic equation ( 2m^2 - 106m - 2497 = 0 ).Using the quadratic formula:[ m = frac{106 pm sqrt{106^2 + 4 times 2 times 2497}}{4} ]Calculate discriminant:[ D = 11236 + 19976 = 31212 ]Square root of 31212 is approximately 176.66.So, the roots are approximately:[ m = frac{106 pm 176.66}{4} ]Calculating the positive root:[ m = frac{106 + 176.66}{4} approx frac{282.66}{4} approx 70.665 ]And the negative root is negative, which we can ignore.So, the inequality ( 2m^2 - 106m - 2497 leq 0 ) holds when ( m leq 70.665 ). Since ( m ) is an integer, ( m leq 70 ).Putting both inequalities together, we have ( m geq 67 ) and ( m leq 70 ). So, ( m ) can be 67, 68, 69, or 70.Now, let's consider each possible value of ( m ) and find the corresponding ( a ).Starting with ( m = 67 ):From earlier, ( (m + 49)^2 leq 3a < (m + 50)^2 )So, ( (67 + 49)^2 = 116^2 = 13456 leq 3a < 117^2 = 13689 )Thus, ( 13456 leq 3a < 13689 )Divide by 3:[ 4485.333... leq a < 4563 ]Also, from ( (m - 1)^2 leq a < m^2 ):( (67 - 1)^2 = 66^2 = 4356 leq a < 67^2 = 4489 )So, combining both:[ 4485.333... leq a < 4489 ]But ( a ) must be an integer, so ( a ) can be 4486, 4487, 4488.Wait, but 4485.333... is approximately 4485.333, so the smallest integer ( a ) is 4486.But let's check if ( a = 4486 ) satisfies the original condition.Compute the number of perfect squares in ( (4486, 3 times 4486) = (4486, 13458) ).Compute ( sqrt{4486} ) and ( sqrt{13458} ).Calculating ( sqrt{4486} ):66^2 = 4356, 67^2 = 4489. So, ( sqrt{4486} ) is just less than 67, approximately 66.99.Similarly, ( sqrt{13458} ):116^2 = 13456, 117^2 = 13689. So, ( sqrt{13458} ) is just a bit more than 116, approximately 116.0008.So, the integers ( n ) such that ( n^2 ) is in ( (4486, 13458) ) are from 67 to 116 inclusive.Number of integers from 67 to 116: 116 - 67 + 1 = 50.Perfect, that's exactly 50. So, ( a = 4486 ) works.But wait, let me check if a smaller ( a ) could also work. For ( m = 67 ), the lower bound for ( a ) is approximately 4485.333, so the smallest integer ( a ) is 4486. So, 4486 is the minimal ( a ) for ( m = 67 ).But let's check ( m = 68 ) just in case.For ( m = 68 ):From ( (68 + 49)^2 = 117^2 = 13689 leq 3a < 118^2 = 13924 )Thus, ( 13689 leq 3a < 13924 )Divide by 3:[ 4563 leq a < 4641.333... ]Also, from ( (68 - 1)^2 = 67^2 = 4489 leq a < 68^2 = 4624 )So, combining:[ 4563 leq a < 4624 ]So, ( a ) can be from 4563 to 4623.But since we are looking for the smallest ( a ), 4563 is larger than 4486, so 4486 is still smaller.Similarly, for ( m = 69 ) and ( m = 70 ), the lower bounds for ( a ) will be even higher, so 4486 is still the smallest.Wait, but just to be thorough, let's check ( m = 67 ) and see if ( a = 4486 ) is indeed the minimal.Is there a smaller ( a ) that could satisfy the condition? Let's check ( a = 4485 ).Compute ( sqrt{4485} ) and ( sqrt{3 times 4485} = sqrt{13455} ).( sqrt{4485} ) is slightly less than 67, since 67^2 = 4489. So, ( sqrt{4485} approx 66.99 ).( sqrt{13455} ) is slightly less than 116.0008, as before.So, the perfect squares in ( (4485, 13455) ) would be from 67^2 = 4489 to 116^2 = 13456. But 13456 is not less than 13455, so the upper bound is 116^2 = 13456, which is not included. So, the perfect squares are from 67^2 to 115^2.Wait, 115^2 = 13225, which is less than 13455. So, the integers ( n ) are from 67 to 115 inclusive.Number of integers: 115 - 67 + 1 = 49.So, only 49 perfect squares, which is less than 50. Therefore, ( a = 4485 ) doesn't work.Similarly, ( a = 4486 ) gives exactly 50 perfect squares as we saw earlier.Therefore, ( a = 4486 ) is indeed the minimal natural number satisfying the condition.But just to make sure, let me check ( a = 4486 ) again.Compute ( sqrt{4486} approx 66.99 ), so the next integer is 67.Compute ( sqrt{3 times 4486} = sqrt{13458} approx 116.0008 ), so the integer part is 116.So, perfect squares from ( 67^2 ) to ( 116^2 ). But wait, 116^2 is 13456, which is less than 13458, so it is included. Wait, but the interval is ( (4486, 13458) ), so 116^2 = 13456 is less than 13458, so it is included.Wait, but earlier I thought that ( sqrt{13458} ) is approximately 116.0008, so 116^2 = 13456 is less than 13458, so 116^2 is included.Wait, so the perfect squares are from 67^2 to 116^2. So, the number of perfect squares is 116 - 67 + 1 = 50.Yes, that's correct. So, ( a = 4486 ) gives exactly 50 perfect squares in the interval ( (4486, 13458) ).Therefore, the smallest natural number ( a ) is 4486.**Final Answer**The smallest natural number ( a ) is boxed{4486}."},{"question":"Alina and Masha wanted to create an interesting version of the school tour of the Olympiad.

In the end, there were 10 problems, and initially, 27 problems were proposed. How many more problems did Masha propose compared to Alina?","answer":"First, let's define the variables:- Let ( A ) be the number of problems Alina proposed.- Let ( M ) be the number of problems Masha proposed.From the problem, we know:1. Masha rejected every second problem proposed by Alina, meaning she accepted half of Alina's problems. So, the number of problems accepted from Alina is ( frac{A}{2} ).2. Alina accepted every third problem proposed by Masha, meaning she accepted one-third of Masha's problems. So, the number of problems accepted from Masha is ( frac{M}{3} ).3. The total number of accepted problems is 10.4. The total number of problems proposed initially was 27.We can set up the following equations based on the information:[frac{A}{2} + frac{M}{3} = 10][A + M = 27]To solve these equations, we'll first eliminate the fractions by multiplying the first equation by 6:[3A + 2M = 60]Now, we'll use the second equation ( A + M = 27 ) to express ( A ) in terms of ( M ):[A = 27 - M]Substituting this into the modified first equation:[3(27 - M) + 2M = 60][81 - 3M + 2M = 60][81 - M = 60][M = 21]Now, substituting ( M = 21 ) back into ( A = 27 - M ):[A = 27 - 21 = 6]Finally, to find how many more problems Masha proposed compared to Alina:[M - A = 21 - 6 = 15]"},{"question":"Determine the odd prime number ( p ) such that the sum of digits of the number ( p^{4} - 5p^{2} + 13 ) is the smallest possible.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find an odd prime number ( p ) such that the sum of the digits of ( p^4 - 5p^2 + 13 ) is as small as possible. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.First, since ( p ) is an odd prime, the smallest primes I should consider are 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. I guess I can start by plugging in these small primes into the expression ( p^4 - 5p^2 + 13 ) and then calculate the sum of the digits of the resulting number. The prime that gives me the smallest digit sum is the one I need.Let me write down the expression again: ( p^4 - 5p^2 + 13 ). Maybe I can factor this expression or simplify it somehow to make calculations easier? Let me see.Looking at ( p^4 - 5p^2 + 13 ), I notice that it's a quartic polynomial. Maybe I can factor it into quadratics or something. Let me try:Let me set ( x = p^2 ). Then the expression becomes ( x^2 - 5x + 13 ). Hmm, can I factor this quadratic? Let's check the discriminant: ( b^2 - 4ac = 25 - 52 = -27 ). Since the discriminant is negative, it doesn't factor over the real numbers, so probably not useful for factoring. Okay, maybe I can't factor it, so I'll just compute the value for each prime.Starting with the smallest odd prime, which is 3.For ( p = 3 ):( 3^4 = 81 )( 5 times 3^2 = 5 times 9 = 45 )So, ( 81 - 45 + 13 = 81 - 45 is 36, plus 13 is 49 ).Now, the sum of digits of 49 is 4 + 9 = 13.Okay, that's a digit sum of 13.Next prime is 5.For ( p = 5 ):( 5^4 = 625 )( 5 times 5^2 = 5 times 25 = 125 )So, ( 625 - 125 + 13 = 625 - 125 is 500, plus 13 is 513 ).Sum of digits: 5 + 1 + 3 = 9.Hmm, that's better, only 9.Next prime is 7.For ( p = 7 ):( 7^4 = 2401 )( 5 times 7^2 = 5 times 49 = 245 )So, ( 2401 - 245 + 13 = 2401 - 245 is 2156, plus 13 is 2169 ).Sum of digits: 2 + 1 + 6 + 9 = 18.That's higher than 9, so not better.Next prime is 11.For ( p = 11 ):( 11^4 = 14641 )( 5 times 11^2 = 5 times 121 = 605 )So, ( 14641 - 605 + 13 = 14641 - 605 is 14036, plus 13 is 14049 ).Sum of digits: 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 9 = 18.Still 18, same as for 7.Next prime is 13.For ( p = 13 ):( 13^4 = 28561 )( 5 times 13^2 = 5 times 169 = 845 )So, ( 28561 - 845 + 13 = 28561 - 845 is 27716, plus 13 is 27729 ).Sum of digits: 2 + 7 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 27.That's even higher. Hmm.Wait, maybe I should check the next prime after 5, which is 7, but I already did that. Let me see if there's a prime between 3 and 5? No, 5 is next after 3.Wait, hold on, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13... Maybe I should check 17 as well.For ( p = 17 ):( 17^4 = 83521 )( 5 times 17^2 = 5 times 289 = 1445 )So, ( 83521 - 1445 + 13 = 83521 - 1445 is 82076, plus 13 is 82089 ).Sum of digits: 8 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 27.Same as 13.Wait, so so far, the smallest digit sum is 9 for ( p = 5 ). Maybe I should check if there's a prime smaller than 5? But 3 is the next one, which gave a digit sum of 13, which is higher than 9. So 5 is better.Wait, hold on, is 5 the only prime that gives a digit sum of 9? Let me check the next few primes just to be thorough.Next prime after 17 is 19.For ( p = 19 ):( 19^4 = 130321 )( 5 times 19^2 = 5 times 361 = 1805 )So, ( 130321 - 1805 + 13 = 130321 - 1805 is 128516, plus 13 is 128529 ).Sum of digits: 1 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 9 = 27.Still 27.Next prime is 23.For ( p = 23 ):( 23^4 = 279841 )( 5 times 23^2 = 5 times 529 = 2645 )So, ( 279841 - 2645 + 13 = 279841 - 2645 is 277196, plus 13 is 277209 ).Sum of digits: 2 + 7 + 7 + 2 + 0 + 9 = 27.Same as before.Hmm, seems like as ( p ) increases, the digit sum is either staying the same or increasing. So, 5 is giving the smallest digit sum so far.But wait, let me check ( p = 2 ). Wait, 2 is a prime, but it's even. The problem specifies an odd prime, so 2 is excluded. So, starting from 3.Wait, just to make sure, let me check ( p = 3 ) again.For ( p = 3 ):( 3^4 = 81 )( 5 times 3^2 = 45 )So, ( 81 - 45 + 13 = 49 )Sum of digits: 4 + 9 = 13.Yes, that's correct.So, 5 gives 9, which is smaller than 13.Is there any prime smaller than 5? No, the primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. Since 2 is excluded, 3 is the next, but 3 gives a higher digit sum.Wait, maybe I should check ( p = 5 ) again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error.For ( p = 5 ):( 5^4 = 625 )( 5 times 5^2 = 125 )So, ( 625 - 125 = 500 )Then, ( 500 + 13 = 513 )Sum of digits: 5 + 1 + 3 = 9.Yes, that's correct. So, 513 is a three-digit number with digits 5, 1, 3.Wait, 5 + 1 + 3 is indeed 9. So, that's correct.Is there any other prime that could give a digit sum less than 9? Let me think.The next prime after 5 is 7, which gave a digit sum of 18, which is higher. So, 5 is better.Wait, let me check ( p = 7 ) again.( 7^4 = 2401 )( 5 times 7^2 = 245 )So, ( 2401 - 245 = 2156 )Then, ( 2156 + 13 = 2169 )Sum of digits: 2 + 1 + 6 + 9 = 18.Yes, that's correct.So, 5 is better.Wait, is there a prime between 5 and 7? No, 5 and 7 are consecutive primes.Wait, let me check ( p = 11 ) again.( 11^4 = 14641 )( 5 times 11^2 = 605 )So, ( 14641 - 605 = 14036 )Then, ( 14036 + 13 = 14049 )Sum of digits: 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 9 = 18.Same as 7.So, seems like 5 is the only prime so far that gives a digit sum of 9.Wait, let me check ( p = 7 ) again. Maybe I miscalculated.Wait, 7^4 is 7*7=49, 49*7=343, 343*7=2401. Correct.5*7^2: 7^2=49, 5*49=245. Correct.2401 - 245: Let's do 2401 - 200 = 2201, then subtract 45: 2201 - 45 = 2156. Correct.2156 + 13 = 2169. Correct.Sum of digits: 2 + 1 + 6 + 9 = 18. Correct.So, 5 is still better.Wait, let me check ( p = 13 ) again.13^4: 13*13=169, 169*13=2197, 2197*13=28561. Correct.5*13^2: 13^2=169, 5*169=845. Correct.28561 - 845: Let's compute 28561 - 800 = 27761, then subtract 45: 27761 - 45 = 27716. Correct.27716 + 13 = 27729. Correct.Sum of digits: 2 + 7 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 27. Correct.So, 5 is still the best.Wait, maybe I should check ( p = 7 ) once more, just to be absolutely sure.2401 - 245: 2401 - 200 is 2201, minus 45 is 2156. 2156 + 13 is 2169. Sum is 2+1+6+9=18. Correct.Hmm.Wait, is there a prime smaller than 5? 3, but 3 gives a digit sum of 13, which is higher than 9.Wait, let me check ( p = 5 ) once more.5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. Correct.5*5^2: 5*25=125. Correct.625 - 125 = 500. 500 +13=513. Sum of digits: 5+1+3=9. Correct.So, 5 is the prime that gives the smallest digit sum so far.Wait, let me think if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe instead of plugging in primes, I can analyze the expression ( p^4 - 5p^2 + 13 ) to see if it can be expressed in a way that makes it easier to compute or analyze the digit sum.Let me write the expression again: ( p^4 - 5p^2 + 13 ).Hmm, perhaps I can write it as ( (p^4 - 5p^2) + 13 ). Maybe factor ( p^2 ) out of the first two terms: ( p^2(p^2 - 5) + 13 ). Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the expression modulo 9, since the digit sum is related to the number modulo 9. The digit sum of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9. So, if I can compute ( p^4 - 5p^2 + 13 ) modulo 9, that might give me some insight into the possible digit sums.Let me compute ( p^4 - 5p^2 + 13 ) mod 9.First, since ( p ) is an odd prime, it's not divisible by 3, so ( p ) mod 3 is either 1 or 2.Let me compute ( p^4 - 5p^2 + 13 ) mod 9 for ( p ) mod 3 = 1 and 2.Case 1: ( p equiv 1 mod 3 )Then, ( p equiv 1 mod 3 ), so ( p equiv 1 ) or 4 or 7 mod 9.Compute ( p^2 mod 9 ):If ( p equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 9 ).If ( p equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^2 = 16 equiv 7 mod 9 ).If ( p equiv 7 mod 9 ), ( p^2 = 49 equiv 4 mod 9 ).Similarly, ( p^4 mod 9 ):If ( p equiv 1 mod 9 ), ( p^4 equiv 1 mod 9 ).If ( p equiv 4 mod 9 ), ( p^4 = (p^2)^2 equiv 7^2 = 49 equiv 4 mod 9 ).If ( p equiv 7 mod 9 ), ( p^4 = (p^2)^2 equiv 4^2 = 16 equiv 7 mod 9 ).So, for ( p equiv 1 mod 3 ), ( p^4 - 5p^2 + 13 mod 9 ):Let's take each subcase:Subcase 1a: ( p equiv 1 mod 9 )Then, ( p^4 equiv 1 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 ).So, ( 1 - 5*1 + 13 = 1 -5 +13 = 9 equiv 0 mod 9 ).Subcase 1b: ( p equiv 4 mod 9 )( p^4 equiv 4 ), ( p^2 equiv 7 ).So, ( 4 -5*7 +13 = 4 -35 +13 = (4 +13) -35 = 17 -35 = -18 equiv 0 mod 9 ).Subcase 1c: ( p equiv 7 mod 9 )( p^4 equiv 7 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 ).So, ( 7 -5*4 +13 = 7 -20 +13 = (7 +13) -20 = 20 -20 = 0 mod 9 ).So, in all subcases where ( p equiv 1 mod 3 ), the expression is congruent to 0 mod 9, meaning the digit sum is a multiple of 9.Case 2: ( p equiv 2 mod 3 )Since ( p ) is an odd prime, it can't be 0 mod 3, so it's either 1 or 2 mod 3.So, ( p equiv 2 mod 3 ), which means ( p equiv 2, 5, 8 mod 9 ).Compute ( p^2 mod 9 ):If ( p equiv 2 mod 9 ), ( p^2 = 4 mod 9 ).If ( p equiv 5 mod 9 ), ( p^2 = 25 equiv 7 mod 9 ).If ( p equiv 8 mod 9 ), ( p^2 = 64 equiv 1 mod 9 ).Similarly, ( p^4 mod 9 ):If ( p equiv 2 mod 9 ), ( p^4 = (p^2)^2 = 4^2 = 16 equiv 7 mod 9 ).If ( p equiv 5 mod 9 ), ( p^4 = (p^2)^2 = 7^2 = 49 equiv 4 mod 9 ).If ( p equiv 8 mod 9 ), ( p^4 = (p^2)^2 = 1^2 = 1 mod 9 ).So, for ( p equiv 2 mod 3 ), ( p^4 -5p^2 +13 mod 9 ):Subcase 2a: ( p equiv 2 mod 9 )( p^4 equiv 7 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 ).So, ( 7 -5*4 +13 = 7 -20 +13 = (7 +13) -20 = 20 -20 = 0 mod 9 ).Subcase 2b: ( p equiv 5 mod 9 )( p^4 equiv 4 ), ( p^2 equiv 7 ).So, ( 4 -5*7 +13 = 4 -35 +13 = (4 +13) -35 = 17 -35 = -18 equiv 0 mod 9 ).Subcase 2c: ( p equiv 8 mod 9 )( p^4 equiv 1 ), ( p^2 equiv 1 ).So, ( 1 -5*1 +13 = 1 -5 +13 = 9 equiv 0 mod 9 ).So, in all cases, whether ( p equiv 1 mod 3 ) or ( p equiv 2 mod 3 ), the expression ( p^4 -5p^2 +13 ) is congruent to 0 mod 9. Therefore, the digit sum must be a multiple of 9.Wait, that's interesting. So, the digit sum is always a multiple of 9 for any odd prime ( p ). Therefore, the smallest possible digit sum is 9, as 0 is not possible because the number ( p^4 -5p^2 +13 ) is positive.Therefore, the minimal digit sum is 9, and we need to find the prime ( p ) that gives this digit sum.From my earlier calculations, ( p = 5 ) gives a digit sum of 9, which is the minimal possible. So, 5 is the answer.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if any other prime could also give a digit sum of 9. For example, if ( p^4 -5p^2 +13 ) is 9, 90, 900, etc., but since the digit sum is 9, the number itself must be a multiple of 9, but the digit sum is 9, so the number could be 9, 18, 27, ..., 90, 99, 108, etc.But for ( p = 5 ), the number is 513, which is 513, sum of digits is 9.Is there another prime ( p ) where ( p^4 -5p^2 +13 ) is a number with digit sum 9?Let me check ( p = 7 ). The number was 2169, sum is 18. So, not 9.( p = 3 ): 49, sum is 13.( p = 11 ): 14049, sum is 18.( p = 13 ): 27729, sum is 27.( p = 17 ): 82089, sum is 27.( p = 19 ): 128529, sum is 27.So, seems like only ( p = 5 ) gives a digit sum of 9.Wait, let me check ( p = 7 ) again. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, 7^4 is 2401, 5*7^2 is 245, so 2401 - 245 is 2156, plus 13 is 2169. Sum is 2+1+6+9=18. Correct.Wait, is there a prime ( p ) where ( p^4 -5p^2 +13 ) is a two-digit number with digit sum 9? For example, 18, 27, 36, etc.Let me see:If ( p^4 -5p^2 +13 = 18 ), then ( p^4 -5p^2 = 5 ). Let's see if any prime satisfies this.Try ( p = 2 ): 16 - 20 = -4 ≠5.( p =3 ): 81 - 45 = 36 ≠5.( p =5 ): 625 - 125 = 500 ≠5.So, no.If ( p^4 -5p^2 +13 = 27 ), then ( p^4 -5p^2 =14 ).Check ( p =2 ): 16 -20 = -4 ≠14.( p =3 ): 81 -45=36≠14.( p =5 ):625 -125=500≠14.No.Similarly, for 36: ( p^4 -5p^2 =23 ). Not likely.So, the only way to get a digit sum of 9 is when the number itself is 513, which is for ( p =5 ).Therefore, the answer is ( p =5 ).**Final Answer**The odd prime number ( p ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"On Fridays, the price of a ticket to a museum is 9. On one particular Saturday, there were 200 visitors to the museum, which was twice as many visitors as there were the day before. The total money collected from ticket sales on that particular Saturday was frac{4}{3} as much as the day before. The price of tickets on Saturdays is k. Determine the value of k.","answer":"First, I'll identify the given information. On Fridays, the ticket price is 9. On a particular Saturday, there were 200 visitors, which is twice the number of visitors on Friday. This means there were 100 visitors on Friday.Next, I'll calculate the total money collected on Friday. With 100 visitors paying 9 each, the total is 100 multiplied by 9, which equals 900.The total money collected on Saturday is given as 4/3 of the amount collected on Friday. So, I'll multiply 900 by 4/3 to find the Saturday total, which is 1200.Finally, to find the ticket price on Saturday (k), I'll divide the total money collected on Saturday by the number of visitors. That is, 1200 divided by 200 visitors equals 6. Therefore, the price of a ticket on Saturday is 6."},{"question":"Two sides of an isosceles triangle are 10 inches and 20 inches. If the shortest side of a similar triangle is 50 inches, what is the perimeter of the larger triangle?","answer":"First, I need to determine the sides of the original isosceles triangle. Since it's isosceles, two sides are equal. The given sides are 10 inches and 20 inches. If the two equal sides are 20 inches each, then the third side is 10 inches. This makes the shortest side 10 inches.Next, I know that the shortest side of the similar larger triangle is 50 inches. To find the scale factor, I divide the shortest side of the larger triangle by the shortest side of the original triangle: 50 ÷ 10 = 5.Using this scale factor, I can find the lengths of the other sides of the larger triangle. The two equal sides are 20 inches each in the original triangle, so in the larger triangle, they will be 20 × 5 = 100 inches each.Finally, to find the perimeter of the larger triangle, I add up all its sides: 50 + 100 + 100 = 250 inches."},{"question":"A right triangle has an area of 120 square units, and a leg length of 24 units.

Plugging the known values into the area formula:[frac{1}{2} times 24 times b = 120]Solving for ( b ):[12b = 120 implies b = 10]Now that both legs are known (24 units and 10 units), I'll use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse ( c ):[c = sqrt{24^2 + 10^2} = sqrt{576 + 100} = sqrt{676} = 26]Finally, the perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all its sides:[24 + 10 + 26 = 60]"},{"question":"It is known that the number ( a ) is ( n ) times greater than the number ( b ), and the sum of the numbers ( a ) and ( b ) is ( m ) times greater than their difference. Find the sum of the numbers ( m ) and ( n ), where ( m ) and ( n ) are natural numbers.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of two natural numbers, m and n. The problem states that number a is n times greater than number b, and the sum of a and b is m times greater than their difference. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, let's translate the given information into mathematical equations. The first part says, \\"the number a is n times greater than the number b.\\" I think this means that a is equal to n multiplied by b. So, I can write that as:a = n * bOkay, that seems straightforward. Now, the second part says, \\"the sum of the numbers a and b is m times greater than their difference.\\" So, the sum is a + b, and the difference is a - b. The sum is m times the difference, so:a + b = m * (a - b)Alright, so now I have two equations:1. a = n * b2. a + b = m * (a - b)My goal is to find m + n, where both m and n are natural numbers. Let me see how I can manipulate these equations to find m and n.Since I have a in terms of b from the first equation, maybe I can substitute that into the second equation. Let's try that.Substituting a = n * b into the second equation:(n * b) + b = m * ((n * b) - b)Let me simplify both sides. On the left side, I can factor out b:b(n + 1) = m * (n * b - b)Similarly, on the right side, I can factor out b as well:b(n + 1) = m * b(n - 1)Hmm, okay, so both sides have a factor of b. Assuming that b is not zero (since if b were zero, a would also be zero, and then the sum and difference would both be zero, which might not make sense in the context of being \\"times greater\\"), I can divide both sides by b to simplify:n + 1 = m(n - 1)Alright, now I have an equation without b:n + 1 = m(n - 1)So, this equation relates m and n. I need to find natural numbers m and n such that this equation holds. Let me rearrange this equation to solve for m or n.Let me solve for m:n + 1 = m(n - 1)Divide both sides by (n - 1):m = (n + 1) / (n - 1)Hmm, so m is equal to (n + 1) divided by (n - 1). Since m has to be a natural number, (n + 1) must be divisible by (n - 1). That is, (n - 1) must be a divisor of (n + 1).Let me think about that. So, (n - 1) divides (n + 1). Let me write that as:(n + 1) mod (n - 1) = 0Which means that when (n + 1) is divided by (n - 1), there is no remainder. Let me compute (n + 1) divided by (n - 1):(n + 1) / (n - 1) = 1 + 2 / (n - 1)Wait, how did I get that? Let me do polynomial division or think about it differently. Let's express (n + 1) as (n - 1) + 2. So:(n + 1) = (n - 1) + 2Therefore, (n + 1)/(n - 1) = 1 + 2/(n - 1)So, m = 1 + 2/(n - 1)Since m is a natural number, 2/(n - 1) must also be an integer. Therefore, (n - 1) must be a divisor of 2.What are the divisors of 2? They are 1 and 2, since 2 is a prime number. So, (n - 1) can be either 1 or 2.Let's consider both cases.Case 1: (n - 1) = 1Then, n = 1 + 1 = 2Substituting back into m = (n + 1)/(n - 1):m = (2 + 1)/(2 - 1) = 3/1 = 3So, m = 3 and n = 2Case 2: (n - 1) = 2Then, n = 2 + 1 = 3Substituting back into m = (n + 1)/(n - 1):m = (3 + 1)/(3 - 1) = 4/2 = 2So, m = 2 and n = 3Wait, so we have two possible solutions: (m, n) = (3, 2) and (2, 3). But the problem says m and n are natural numbers, so both are acceptable. However, the question is asking for the sum of m and n. Let me compute that.For the first case: m + n = 3 + 2 = 5For the second case: m + n = 2 + 3 = 5So, in both cases, the sum is 5.Wait, that's interesting. So regardless of which case we take, the sum is the same. So, the sum of m and n is 5.But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with the first case: n = 2, m = 3So, a = n * b = 2bSum: a + b = 2b + b = 3bDifference: a - b = 2b - b = bSo, sum is 3b, which is 3 times the difference (which is b). So, 3b = 3 * b, which is correct. So, that works.Second case: n = 3, m = 2So, a = 3bSum: a + b = 3b + b = 4bDifference: a - b = 3b - b = 2bSo, sum is 4b, which is 2 times the difference (2b). So, 4b = 2 * 2b, which is correct. So, that also works.Therefore, both cases are valid, and in both cases, m + n = 5.So, the answer is 5.I think that's solid. I considered both possible divisors of 2, found the corresponding m and n, checked both cases, and both satisfy the original conditions. Therefore, the sum is 5.**Final Answer**The sum of the numbers ( m ) and ( n ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"A certain number greater than 1000, if increased by 79 becomes a perfect square; if increased by 204, it becomes another perfect square. Find the original number.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: there's a number greater than 1000, and if I add 79 to it, it becomes a perfect square. Then, if I add 204 to the original number, it becomes another perfect square. I need to find the original number. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me denote the original number as ( N ). According to the problem, ( N + 79 ) is a perfect square, and ( N + 204 ) is another perfect square. So, I can write this as:( N + 79 = a^2 )  ( N + 204 = b^2 )where ( a ) and ( b ) are integers, and ( b > a ) because ( 204 > 79 ), so the second perfect square is larger.Now, if I subtract the first equation from the second, I get:( (N + 204) - (N + 79) = b^2 - a^2 )  Simplifying this, the ( N ) terms cancel out:( 204 - 79 = b^2 - a^2 )  ( 125 = b^2 - a^2 )Hmm, so ( b^2 - a^2 = 125 ). I remember that ( b^2 - a^2 ) can be factored as ( (b - a)(b + a) ). So, let's write that:( (b - a)(b + a) = 125 )Now, 125 is a specific number, so I can find pairs of integers that multiply to 125. Since ( b ) and ( a ) are positive integers and ( b > a ), both ( b - a ) and ( b + a ) must be positive integers as well. Also, ( b - a ) must be less than ( b + a ).Let me list the factor pairs of 125:1. ( 1 times 125 )2. ( 5 times 25 )Wait, 125 is ( 5^3 ), so these are the only factor pairs where both factors are positive integers. Let me check if there are any others, but 125 is a prime power, so no, those are the only ones.So, now I can set up two cases based on these factor pairs.**Case 1:**( b - a = 1 )  ( b + a = 125 )If I solve these two equations, I can find ( a ) and ( b ).Adding the two equations:( (b - a) + (b + a) = 1 + 125 )  ( 2b = 126 )  ( b = 63 )Substituting back into ( b - a = 1 ):( 63 - a = 1 )  ( a = 62 )So, in this case, ( a = 62 ) and ( b = 63 ).**Case 2:**( b - a = 5 )  ( b + a = 25 )Again, adding the two equations:( (b - a) + (b + a) = 5 + 25 )  ( 2b = 30 )  ( b = 15 )Substituting back into ( b - a = 5 ):( 15 - a = 5 )  ( a = 10 )So, in this case, ( a = 10 ) and ( b = 15 ).Now, I have two possible pairs for ( a ) and ( b ): (62, 63) and (10, 15). Let me check both cases to see which one gives a valid ( N ) greater than 1000.Starting with **Case 1**:We have ( N + 79 = a^2 = 62^2 ).Calculating ( 62^2 ):( 62 times 62 = 3844 )So, ( N = 3844 - 79 = 3844 - 79 ).Let me compute that:( 3844 - 70 = 3774 )  ( 3774 - 9 = 3765 )So, ( N = 3765 ).Now, let's check if ( N + 204 ) is a perfect square:( 3765 + 204 = 3969 )Is 3969 a perfect square? Let me check:I know that ( 63^2 = 3969 ), because ( 60^2 = 3600 ) and ( 63^2 = (60 + 3)^2 = 60^2 + 2 times 60 times 3 + 3^2 = 3600 + 360 + 9 = 3969 ). So yes, it is a perfect square.So, in Case 1, we get ( N = 3765 ), which is greater than 1000, so that's a valid solution.Now, let's check **Case 2**:We have ( N + 79 = a^2 = 10^2 = 100 ).So, ( N = 100 - 79 = 21 ).But the problem states that the number is greater than 1000, so 21 is too small. Therefore, Case 2 is invalid.Therefore, the only valid solution is ( N = 3765 ).Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify.First, ( N = 3765 ).Adding 79: ( 3765 + 79 = 3844 ). Is 3844 a perfect square? Yes, because ( 62^2 = 3844 ).Adding 204: ( 3765 + 204 = 3969 ). Is 3969 a perfect square? Yes, because ( 63^2 = 3969 ).So, both conditions are satisfied, and ( N = 3765 ) is indeed greater than 1000. Therefore, I think this is the correct answer.I don't think there are any other factor pairs for 125 because 125 is ( 5^3 ), so the only positive integer factor pairs are (1,125) and (5,25). So, I think I've covered all possible cases.Just to recap:1. Let ( N + 79 = a^2 ) and ( N + 204 = b^2 ).2. Subtracting gives ( b^2 - a^2 = 125 ).3. Factor into ( (b - a)(b + a) = 125 ).4. Find factor pairs: (1,125) and (5,25).5. Solve for ( a ) and ( b ) in each case.6. Check which ( N ) is greater than 1000.Everything seems to check out. So, I feel confident that 3765 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The original number is boxed{3765}."},{"question":"Vinny wrote down all the single-digit base-b numbers and added them in base b, getting 34_b.What is b?","answer":"Okay, so Vinny wrote down all the single-digit base-b numbers and added them in base-b, getting 34_b. I need to find what b is. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I should recall what single-digit numbers in base-b look like. In any base-b system, the digits range from 0 up to b-1. So, single-digit numbers in base-b are 0, 1, 2, ..., up to b-1. But wait, when Vinny wrote down all the single-digit numbers, did he include 0? Because if he did, then the sum would include 0, which doesn't affect the sum, but if he didn't, then the sum would be from 1 to b-1. The problem says \\"all the single-digit base-b numbers,\\" which typically includes 0, right? So, I think 0 is included.But just to be safe, maybe I should consider both cases: one where 0 is included and one where it's not. Let's see.If 0 is included, then the numbers are 0, 1, 2, ..., b-1. The sum of these numbers is the sum from 0 to b-1, which is (b-1)*b/2. If 0 is not included, then the sum is from 1 to b-1, which is also (b-1)*b/2. Wait, that's the same! So, whether 0 is included or not, the sum is (b-1)*b/2. Interesting, so maybe it doesn't matter.But wait, in base-b, when we write numbers, 0 is a digit, but when we talk about single-digit numbers, sometimes people consider 0 as a digit but not as a \\"number\\" in the sense of counting numbers. So, maybe Vinny didn't include 0. Hmm, but the problem says \\"all the single-digit base-b numbers,\\" which should include 0 because 0 is a single-digit number in base-b. So, maybe I should include 0.But since the sum is the same whether I include 0 or not, maybe it doesn't matter. So, moving on.The sum of all single-digit base-b numbers is (b-1)*b/2. But Vinny added them in base-b and got 34_b. So, 34_b is equal to (b-1)*b/2 in base-10.Wait, let me write that down:Sum in base-10: (b-1)*b/2Sum in base-b: 34_bSo, 34_b in base-10 is equal to 3*b + 4.Therefore, we have the equation:(b-1)*b/2 = 3*b + 4So, let's write that equation:(b-1)*b / 2 = 3b + 4Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:(b-1)*b = 6b + 8Expand the left side:b^2 - b = 6b + 8Bring all terms to one side:b^2 - b - 6b - 8 = 0Simplify:b^2 -7b -8 = 0So, now we have a quadratic equation: b^2 -7b -8 = 0Let's solve for b. We can use the quadratic formula:b = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 32)] / 2Because the quadratic is b^2 -7b -8, so a=1, b=-7, c=-8.Wait, actually, the quadratic formula is (-b ± sqrt(b^2 -4ac)) / 2a.So, plugging in:b = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 32)] / 2Wait, discriminant is (-7)^2 -4*1*(-8) = 49 +32=81.So, sqrt(81)=9.Thus, b = [7 ±9]/2So, two solutions:b = (7 +9)/2 = 16/2=8b = (7 -9)/2 = (-2)/2=-1But base cannot be negative, so b=8.So, the base is 8.Wait, let me verify this.If b=8, then single-digit numbers are 0 through 7.Sum is 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28.In base-8, 28 in base-10 is equal to 34_8?Let me check: 3*8 +4=24+4=28. Yes, that's correct.So, 34_8 is 28 in base-10, which is the sum of digits from 0 to7.Therefore, b=8 is correct.But just to make sure, let's think again.Wait, the problem says Vinny wrote down all the single-digit base-b numbers and added them in base-b, getting 34_b.So, he added them in base-b, meaning he performed the addition in base-b, not converting to base-10 first.But wait, the sum he got was 34_b, which is in base-b. So, if he added the numbers in base-b, the result is 34_b.But whether he added them in base-b or converted each number to base-10 and added, the result should be the same, right? Because addition is consistent across bases.Wait, no, actually, the process is different. If he adds them in base-b, he might have carries, but the final result is 34_b, which is equal to 3b +4 in base-10.But the sum of the numbers from 0 to b-1 is (b-1)*b/2 in base-10.So, equating that to 3b +4, we get the equation as before, leading to b=8.So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, if he added them in base-b, the sum is 34_b, which is 3b +4 in base-10, which is equal to the sum of 0+1+2+...+(b-1)= (b-1)*b/2.So, same equation, same result.Therefore, b=8.I think that's solid.**Final Answer**The base ( b ) is boxed{8}."},{"question":"Faruq subtracted 5 from a number and then divided by 4.

It looks like each term is a product of two consecutive numbers, starting from 1×2, then 2×3, 3×4, and so on, up to 2001×2002. But the signs alternate: the first term is positive, the second is negative, the third is positive, and so on.So, the series alternates between addition and subtraction of these products. Let me write out the first few terms to see the pattern clearly:1×2 - 2×3 + 3×4 - 4×5 + 5×6 - ... + 2001×2002Yes, that's right.

Let me see:Wait, for n=1: 1n=2: 2n=3: 4n=4: 6n=5: 9Wait, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9: These are the numbers of the form k(k+1)/2 where k is 1,2,3,4,5: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15. No, that's not matching.Alternatively, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9: Let's see the differences between them:From 1 to 2: +12 to 4: +24 to 6: +26 to 9: +3So, the differences are 1,2,2,3. Hmm, not a clear pattern.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of n. Let me try to express S_n in terms of n.Looking at the results:n | S_n1 | 22 | -43 | 84 | -125 | 18Wait, let's see if S_n can be expressed as (-1)^{n+1} × something.For n=1: 2 = 2n=2: -4 = -4n=3: 8 = 8n=4: -12 = -12n=5: 18 = 18So, S_n = (-1)^{n+1} × 2 × something.Looking at the absolute values: 2,4,8,12,18,...Wait, 2 = 2×14 = 2×28 = 2×412 = 2×618 = 2×9So, 1,2,4,6,9: These are 1, 2, 4, 6, 9. Wait, these are the triangular numbers but shifted or something.Wait, 1 is T1, 3 is T2, 6 is T3, 10 is T4, 15 is T5. So, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 are not triangular numbers.Wait, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9: Let me see:1 = 12 = 1 + 14 = 1 + 1 + 26 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 29 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3Hmm, that's interesting. It seems like each term is adding the next integer, but sometimes repeating.Wait, maybe it's the sum of floor((k+1)/2) for k from 1 to n.Wait, let me compute floor((k+1)/2) for k=1 to 5:k=1: floor(2/2)=1k=2: floor(3/2)=1k=3: floor(4/2)=2k=4: floor(5/2)=2k=5: floor(6/2)=3So, summing these: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 9, which is the value for n=5. Hmm, that's matching.Wait, so for n=1: floor((1+1)/2)=1, sum=1But S_1=2, which is 2×1n=2: floor((1+1)/2)=1, floor((2+1)/2)=1, sum=2, S_2=-4= -2×2n=3: sum=1+1+2=4, S_3=8=2×4n=4: sum=1+1+2+2=6, S_4=-12= -2×6n=5: sum=1+1+2+2+3=9, S_5=18=2×9So, it seems that S_n = (-1)^{n+1} × 2 × sum_{k=1}^{n} floor((k+1)/2)Hmm, that's an interesting pattern. So, if I can find a formula for sum_{k=1}^{n} floor((k+1)/2), then I can express S_n in terms of that.Let me try to find a formula for sum_{k=1}^{n} floor((k+1)/2).Let me denote m = floor((k+1)/2). Let's see what m is for different k:For k=1: floor(2/2)=1k=2: floor(3/2)=1k=3: floor(4/2)=2k=4: floor(5/2)=2k=5: floor(6/2)=3k=6: floor(7/2)=3So, for k odd: k=2m-1, floor((k+1)/2)=mFor k even: k=2m, floor((k+1)/2)=mSo, for each m, there are two terms contributing m to the sum: one for k=2m-1 and one for k=2m.Therefore, the sum can be expressed as:sum_{m=1}^{floor((n+1)/2)} m × 2, but we have to adjust if n is odd or even.Wait, let's think about it.If n is even, say n=2p, then the sum is:sum_{m=1}^{p} m × 2Because for each m from 1 to p, there are two terms (k=2m-1 and k=2m) contributing m each.So, sum = 2 × sum_{m=1}^{p} m = 2 × (p(p+1))/2 = p(p+1)Similarly, if n is odd, say n=2p+1, then the sum is:sum_{m=1}^{p} m × 2 + (p+1)Because for m=1 to p, we have two terms each, and then an extra term for k=2p+1, which contributes m=p+1.So, sum = 2 × sum_{m=1}^{p} m + (p+1) = 2 × (p(p+1))/2 + (p+1) = p(p+1) + (p+1) = (p+1)(p +1) = (p+1)^2Therefore, putting it together:If n is even, n=2p, sum = p(p+1)If n is odd, n=2p+1, sum = (p+1)^2So, in terms of n:If n is even:sum = (n/2)(n/2 +1) = (n(n+2))/4If n is odd:sum = ((n+1)/2)^2 = (n+1)^2 /4So, combining both cases, we can write sum = floor((n+1)/2) × ceil((n+1)/2)Wait, because for even n=2p, floor((n+1)/2)=p, ceil((n+1)/2)=p+1, so product is p(p+1)For odd n=2p+1, floor((n+1)/2)=p+1, ceil((n+1)/2)=p+1, so product is (p+1)^2Therefore, sum = floor((n+1)/2) × ceil((n+1)/2) = floor((n+1)/2) × ceil((n+1)/2)Alternatively, sum = floor((n+1)^2 /4). Wait, let's check:For n=1: floor((1+1)^2 /4)=floor(4/4)=1, which matches.n=2: floor((2+1)^2 /4)=floor(9/4)=2, which matches.n=3: floor((3+1)^2 /4)=floor(16/4)=4, which matches.n=4: floor((4+1)^2 /4)=floor(25/4)=6, which matches.n=5: floor((5+1)^2 /4)=floor(36/4)=9, which matches.Yes, so sum_{k=1}^{n} floor((k+1)/2) = floor((n+1)^2 /4)Therefore, S_n = (-1)^{n+1} × 2 × floor((n+1)^2 /4)But wait, let me confirm:For n=1: floor((2)^2 /4)=1, 2×1=2, S_1=2, correct.n=2: floor(9/4)=2, 2×2=4, S_2=-4, correct.n=3: floor(16/4)=4, 2×4=8, S_3=8, correct.n=4: floor(25/4)=6, 2×6=12, S_4=-12, correct.n=5: floor(36/4)=9, 2×9=18, S_5=18, correct.Perfect, so the formula holds.Therefore, S_n = (-1)^{n+1} × 2 × floor( (n+1)^2 /4 )But in our problem, n=2001. So, let's compute S_{2001}.First, compute (2001 +1)^2 /4 = (2002)^2 /4Compute 2002 squared:2002 × 2002: Let's compute this.2002 × 2002:First, note that 2000² = 4,000,000Then, 2002² = (2000 + 2)² = 2000² + 2×2000×2 + 2² = 4,000,000 + 8,000 + 4 = 4,008,004So, 2002² = 4,008,004Divide by 4: 4,008,004 /4 = 1,002,001So, floor( (2002)^2 /4 ) = floor(1,002,001) = 1,002,001Therefore, S_{2001} = (-1)^{2001+1} × 2 × 1,002,001Simplify the exponent:2001 +1 = 2002, which is even, so (-1)^{2002}=1Therefore, S_{2001}=1 × 2 × 1,002,001 = 2,004,002Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, I found that S_n = (-1)^{n+1} × 2 × floor( (n+1)^2 /4 )Then, for n=2001, compute (2001 +1)^2 /4 = 2002² /4 = 4,008,004 /4 = 1,002,001Then, S_{2001}= (-1)^{2002} × 2 × 1,002,001 = 1 × 2 × 1,002,001 = 2,004,002Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again: is there another way to compute this sum?Alternatively, maybe I can express each term as a difference of two terms, so that the series telescopes.Let me consider the general term:(-1)^{k+1} × k × (k+1) = (-1)^{k+1} × (k² +k)So, the sum becomes:sum_{k=1}^{2001} (-1)^{k+1} × (k² +k) = sum_{k=1}^{2001} (-1)^{k+1} k² + sum_{k=1}^{2001} (-1)^{k+1} kSo, S = S1 + S2, where S1 is the sum of (-1)^{k+1} k² and S2 is the sum of (-1)^{k+1} kMaybe computing S1 and S2 separately can help.Let me compute S2 first, since it's the alternating sum of the first n natural numbers.S2 = sum_{k=1}^{2001} (-1)^{k+1} kThis is a well-known alternating series. The sum of the first n terms of the alternating series 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... + (-1)^{n+1} n is given by:If n is even: S2 = -n/2If n is odd: S2 = (n+1)/2Since 2001 is odd, S2 = (2001 +1)/2 = 2002 /2 = 1001So, S2 = 1001Now, let's compute S1 = sum_{k=1}^{2001} (-1)^{k+1} k²This is the alternating sum of squares. I need a formula for this.I recall that the sum of the first n terms of the alternating series 1 - 4 + 9 - 16 + ... + (-1)^{n+1} n² can be expressed as:If n is even: S1 = -n(n+1)/2If n is odd: S1 = (n+1)^2 /2Wait, let me verify this with small n.For n=1: 1 = 1, formula: (1+1)^2 /2 = 4/2=2. Hmm, not matching.Wait, maybe I'm misremembering.Let me compute S1 for small n:n=1: 1, sum=1n=2: 1 - 4 = -3n=3: 1 -4 +9=6n=4:1 -4 +9 -16= -10n=5:1 -4 +9 -16 +25=15Looking for a pattern:n | S11 |12 |-33 |64 |-105 |15Hmm, 1, -3, 6, -10, 15,...These are the triangular numbers with alternating signs.Triangular numbers: T1=1, T2=3, T3=6, T4=10, T5=15,...So, S1 for n=1: T1=1n=2: -T2=-3n=3: T3=6n=4: -T4=-10n=5: T5=15So, S1 = (-1)^{n+1} × T_n, where T_n is the nth triangular number.Triangular number T_n = n(n+1)/2So, S1 = (-1)^{n+1} × n(n+1)/2Wait, let's check:For n=1: (-1)^2 ×1×2/2=1×1=1, correct.n=2: (-1)^3 ×2×3/2= -1×3= -3, correct.n=3: (-1)^4 ×3×4/2=1×6=6, correct.n=4: (-1)^5 ×4×5/2= -1×10= -10, correct.n=5: (-1)^6 ×5×6/2=1×15=15, correct.Perfect, so S1 = (-1)^{n+1} × n(n+1)/2Therefore, for n=2001:S1 = (-1)^{2002} × 2001×2002 /2Since 2002 is even, (-1)^{2002}=1So, S1=1 × (2001×2002)/2 = (2001×2002)/2Compute 2001×2002:2001×2002: Let's compute this.2001×2002 = 2001×(2000 +2) = 2001×2000 + 2001×2 = 4,002,000 + 4,002 = 4,006,002Then, divide by 2: 4,006,002 /2 = 2,003,001So, S1=2,003,001Earlier, we found S2=1001Therefore, the total sum S = S1 + S2 = 2,003,001 + 1001 = 2,004,002Which matches the result we got earlier using the other method. So, that's reassuring.Therefore, the value of the series is 2,004,002.But just to make sure, let me recap the steps:1. Recognized the series alternates signs and involves products of consecutive integers.2. Expressed the general term as (-1)^{k+1} × k × (k+1).3. Tried to compute partial sums and noticed a pattern, leading to the formula involving floor((n+1)^2 /4).4. Alternatively, split the sum into two parts: sum of (-1)^{k+1} k² and sum of (-1)^{k+1} k.5. Found formulas for both sums, computed them separately, and added to get the total.Both methods led to the same result, so I'm confident that 2,004,002 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of the series is boxed{2004002}."},{"question":"Let m, n in mathbb{R}, i be the imaginary unit. If 1-sqrt{3}i is an imaginary root of the quadratic equation x^{2}+mx+n=0, then m+n=______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: given that (1 - sqrt{3}i) is an imaginary root of the quadratic equation (x^2 + mx + n = 0), where (m) and (n) are real numbers. I need to find (m + n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for polynomials with real coefficients, if there's a complex root, its complex conjugate must also be a root. So, if (1 - sqrt{3}i) is a root, then its conjugate, which is (1 + sqrt{3}i), must also be a root. That makes sense because the coefficients are real, so the imaginary parts have to cancel out somehow.So, the quadratic equation has two roots: (1 - sqrt{3}i) and (1 + sqrt{3}i). Now, since it's a quadratic equation, I can express it in terms of its roots. The standard form is (x^2 - (sum of roots)x + (product of roots) = 0). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.Yes, if the roots are (r_1) and (r_2), then the quadratic can be written as (x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1 r_2 = 0). So, in this case, the sum of the roots is ((1 - sqrt{3}i) + (1 + sqrt{3}i)), and the product is ((1 - sqrt{3}i)(1 + sqrt{3}i)).Let me compute the sum first. Adding the two roots:[(1 - sqrt{3}i) + (1 + sqrt{3}i) = 1 + 1 + (-sqrt{3}i + sqrt{3}i) = 2 + 0i = 2]So, the sum of the roots is 2. That means the coefficient of (x) in the quadratic equation is (-2). But in the given equation, the coefficient is (m). So, comparing (x^2 - (sum)x + (product) = 0) with (x^2 + mx + n = 0), we have:[- (sum) = m implies m = -2]Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. The standard form is (x^2 - (sum)x + (product) = 0), so when we compare to (x^2 + mx + n = 0), we have:[- (sum) = m quad text{and} quad product = n]Yes, that's correct. So, since the sum is 2, (m = -2).Now, let's compute the product of the roots. The product is:[(1 - sqrt{3}i)(1 + sqrt{3}i)]I remember that when you multiply a binomial by its conjugate, it's a difference of squares. So, this should be (1^2 - (sqrt{3}i)^2). Let's compute that:First, (1^2 = 1).Then, ((sqrt{3}i)^2 = (sqrt{3})^2 cdot i^2 = 3 cdot (-1) = -3).So, putting it together:[1 - (-3) = 1 + 3 = 4]Therefore, the product of the roots is 4. Since the product is equal to (n), we have (n = 4).So, now we have (m = -2) and (n = 4). The question asks for (m + n), so let's compute that:[m + n = (-2) + 4 = 2]Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify everything again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Roots are (1 - sqrt{3}i) and (1 + sqrt{3}i).2. Sum of roots: (1 - sqrt{3}i + 1 + sqrt{3}i = 2). So, sum is 2.3. Product: ((1 - sqrt{3}i)(1 + sqrt{3}i) = 1 - ( sqrt{3}i )^2 = 1 - (-3) = 4). So, product is 4.4. Quadratic equation is (x^2 - (sum)x + (product) = x^2 - 2x + 4 = 0).5. Comparing with given equation (x^2 + mx + n = 0), so (m = -2) and (n = 4).6. Therefore, (m + n = -2 + 4 = 2).Everything checks out. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's always good to double-check, especially when dealing with complex numbers because it's easy to mix up signs or forget about the properties of conjugates.Alternatively, another way to approach this is by plugging the root into the equation and solving for (m) and (n). Let me try that method as a verification.Given that (1 - sqrt{3}i) is a root, plugging it into the equation:[(1 - sqrt{3}i)^2 + m(1 - sqrt{3}i) + n = 0]Let me compute each term step by step.First, compute ((1 - sqrt{3}i)^2):[(1)^2 + (-sqrt{3}i)^2 + 2 cdot 1 cdot (-sqrt{3}i) = 1 + (3i^2) - 2sqrt{3}i = 1 + 3(-1) - 2sqrt{3}i = 1 - 3 - 2sqrt{3}i = -2 - 2sqrt{3}i]Wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me compute it again.Actually, ((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2). So, applying that:[(1 - sqrt{3}i)^2 = 1^2 - 2 cdot 1 cdot sqrt{3}i + (sqrt{3}i)^2 = 1 - 2sqrt{3}i + 3i^2]Since (i^2 = -1), this becomes:[1 - 2sqrt{3}i + 3(-1) = 1 - 2sqrt{3}i - 3 = (1 - 3) - 2sqrt{3}i = -2 - 2sqrt{3}i]Yes, that's correct.Now, compute (m(1 - sqrt{3}i)):[m cdot 1 - m cdot sqrt{3}i = m - msqrt{3}i]So, putting it all together into the equation:[(-2 - 2sqrt{3}i) + (m - msqrt{3}i) + n = 0]Combine like terms:Real parts: (-2 + m + n)Imaginary parts: (-2sqrt{3}i - msqrt{3}i)So, the equation becomes:[(-2 + m + n) + (-2sqrt{3} - msqrt{3})i = 0]Since the equation equals zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. Therefore, we have two equations:1. Real part: (-2 + m + n = 0)2. Imaginary part: (-2sqrt{3} - msqrt{3} = 0)Let's solve the imaginary part equation first:[-2sqrt{3} - msqrt{3} = 0]Factor out (sqrt{3}):[sqrt{3}(-2 - m) = 0]Since (sqrt{3} neq 0), we have:[-2 - m = 0 implies -m = 2 implies m = -2]Okay, so (m = -2). Now, plug this into the real part equation:[-2 + (-2) + n = 0 implies -4 + n = 0 implies n = 4]So again, we get (m = -2) and (n = 4), which means (m + n = -2 + 4 = 2). That's consistent with what I found earlier. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.I think I'm confident now that the answer is 2. Just to recap, because the coefficients are real, the complex roots come in conjugate pairs. So, once we know one root, we automatically know the other. Then, using Vieta's formulas, which relate the sum and product of roots to the coefficients, we can find (m) and (n). Alternatively, substituting the root into the equation and separating real and imaginary parts also leads us to the same values for (m) and (n). Both methods are solid, and they agree, so I don't see any issues here.One thing I might have tripped up on is remembering the signs in Vieta's formulas. The sum of the roots is equal to (-b/a) in the quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0). In our case, the equation is (x^2 + mx + n = 0), so (a = 1), (b = m), and (c = n). So, the sum of roots is (-b/a = -m/1 = -m). Wait, hold on, that seems conflicting with what I did earlier.Wait, no, actually, Vieta's formula says that for (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), the sum of roots is (-b/a), and the product is (c/a). So, in our case, sum of roots is (-m/1 = -m), and product is (n/1 = n). So, in the first method, I had:Sum of roots = 2 = -m => m = -2Product of roots = 4 = nSo, that's consistent. So, that's another way to think about it. So, that's why in the first method, m is equal to negative the sum.Therefore, whether I use Vieta's formula directly or substitute the root into the equation, I end up with the same result. So, that's good.I think I've covered all the bases here. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods confirm that (m + n = 2). So, I feel confident that the answer is 2.**Final Answer**The value of (m + n) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Given numbers ( x_{1}, ldots, x_{n} in (0,1) ), find the maximum value of the expressionA = frac{sqrt[4]{1-x_{1}} + ldots + sqrt[4]{1-x_{n}}}{frac{1}{sqrt[4]{x_{1}}} + ldots + frac{1}{sqrt[4]{x_{n}}}}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of the expression A, which is given by the ratio of two sums. The numerator is the sum of the fourth roots of (1 - x_i) for each i from 1 to n, and the denominator is the sum of the reciprocals of the fourth roots of x_i for each i from 1 to n. All the x_i are between 0 and 1. First, I want to understand the structure of this expression. It's a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are sums involving the variables x_i. Since all x_i are in (0,1), their reciprocals will be greater than 1, and the fourth roots will be between 0 and 1 as well. I remember that when dealing with expressions that involve sums and ratios, techniques like the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the AM-GM inequality might be useful. Maybe I can apply one of these inequalities here. Let me think about how.Looking at the numerator, it's the sum of (1 - x_i)^{1/4}, and the denominator is the sum of 1/(x_i)^{1/4}. It seems like there's a reciprocal relationship between the terms in the numerator and denominator. Maybe I can pair each term in the numerator with the corresponding term in the denominator.Let me denote a_i = (1 - x_i)^{1/4} and b_i = 1/(x_i)^{1/4}. Then, the expression A becomes (a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n)/(b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n). Hmm, so A is the ratio of the sum of a_i's to the sum of b_i's. I wonder if there's a way to relate a_i and b_i for each i. Let me express b_i in terms of a_i. From the definition, a_i = (1 - x_i)^{1/4}, so (1 - x_i) = a_i^4. Therefore, x_i = 1 - a_i^4. Then, b_i = 1/(x_i)^{1/4} = 1/(1 - a_i^4)^{1/4}. So, b_i is a function of a_i: b_i = (1 - a_i^4)^{-1/4}. Now, the expression A is (a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n)/(b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n) = (a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n)/[(1 - a_1^4)^{-1/4} + ... + (1 - a_n^4)^{-1/4}]. This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a relationship between a_i and b_i that can help me maximize A. Since A is a ratio, perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the numerator and denominator.The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers, (sum a_i b_i)^2 ≤ (sum a_i^2)(sum b_i^2). But in this case, I have a ratio of sums, not a product. Maybe I can manipulate it differently.Alternatively, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. But I'm not sure how to apply it directly here.Wait, perhaps I can consider each term a_i and b_i separately and find a relationship between them. Let me look at a single term. For each i, I have a_i = (1 - x_i)^{1/4} and b_i = 1/(x_i)^{1/4}. Let me express a_i in terms of b_i. From b_i = 1/(x_i)^{1/4}, we get x_i = 1/(b_i^4). Then, a_i = (1 - x_i)^{1/4} = (1 - 1/(b_i^4))^{1/4}. So, a_i = [ (b_i^4 - 1)/b_i^4 ]^{1/4} = (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} / b_i. Hmm, so a_i = (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} / b_i. I wonder if I can find a maximum value for a_i / b_i or something similar. Let me compute a_i / b_i:a_i / b_i = [ (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} / b_i ] / b_i = (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} / b_i^2.I need to find the maximum of (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} / b_i^2. Let me denote f(b_i) = (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} / b_i^2.To find the maximum of f(b_i), I can take the derivative with respect to b_i and set it to zero.Let me compute f(b_i):f(b_i) = (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} / b_i^2.Let me make a substitution: let t = b_i^4 - 1. Then, t = b_i^4 - 1, so b_i^4 = t + 1, and b_i = (t + 1)^{1/4}. But maybe it's easier to compute the derivative directly. Let me write f(b_i) as (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} * b_i^{-2}.Let me compute the derivative f’(b_i):f’(b_i) = d/db_i [ (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} * b_i^{-2} ].Using the product rule:f’(b_i) = (d/db_i (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4}) * b_i^{-2} + (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} * d/db_i (b_i^{-2}).Compute each derivative separately:First derivative: d/db_i (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} = (1/4)(b_i^4 - 1)^{-3/4} * 4b_i^3 = b_i^3 / (b_i^4 - 1)^{3/4}.Second derivative: d/db_i (b_i^{-2}) = -2b_i^{-3}.So, putting it all together:f’(b_i) = [ b_i^3 / (b_i^4 - 1)^{3/4} ] * b_i^{-2} + (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} * (-2b_i^{-3}).Simplify each term:First term: [ b_i^3 / (b_i^4 - 1)^{3/4} ] * b_i^{-2} = b_i / (b_i^4 - 1)^{3/4}.Second term: (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} * (-2b_i^{-3}) = -2 / [ b_i^3 (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} ].So, f’(b_i) = [ b_i / (b_i^4 - 1)^{3/4} ] - [ 2 / ( b_i^3 (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} ) ].To find critical points, set f’(b_i) = 0:[ b_i / (b_i^4 - 1)^{3/4} ] = [ 2 / ( b_i^3 (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/4} ) ].Multiply both sides by (b_i^4 - 1)^{3/4} * b_i^3:b_i * b_i^3 = 2 (b_i^4 - 1)^{ (3/4 - 1/4) }.Simplify:b_i^4 = 2 (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/2}.Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:(b_i^4)^2 = [ 2 (b_i^4 - 1)^{1/2} ]^2.So,b_i^8 = 4 (b_i^4 - 1).Bring all terms to one side:b_i^8 - 4b_i^4 + 4 = 0.Let me set y = b_i^4, so the equation becomes:y^2 - 4y + 4 = 0.This is a quadratic equation: y^2 - 4y + 4 = 0.Solving for y:y = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 16)] / 2 = [4 ± 0]/2 = 2.So, y = 2. Therefore, b_i^4 = 2, so b_i = 2^{1/4}.Since b_i is positive, we take the positive root.So, the critical point is at b_i = 2^{1/4}.Now, let's check if this is a maximum. Let me compute the second derivative or test the values around this point.Alternatively, since we have only one critical point and the function tends to zero as b_i approaches 1 from above and as b_i approaches infinity, this critical point is likely a maximum.So, the maximum of f(b_i) occurs at b_i = 2^{1/4}, and the maximum value is:f(2^{1/4}) = ( (2^{1/4})^4 - 1 )^{1/4} / (2^{1/4})^2.Simplify:(2 - 1)^{1/4} / 2^{1/2} = 1^{1/4} / sqrt(2) = 1 / sqrt(2).So, the maximum value of a_i / b_i is 1 / sqrt(2).Therefore, for each term, a_i / b_i ≤ 1 / sqrt(2).So, if I sum over all i, I get:Sum_{i=1}^n a_i / Sum_{i=1}^n b_i ≤ Sum_{i=1}^n (1 / sqrt(2)) / Sum_{i=1}^n b_i.Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each a_i / b_i is ≤ 1 / sqrt(2), but the ratio of the sums is not necessarily the sum of the ratios. So, I need a different approach.Wait, perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the numerator and denominator.The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that (sum a_i b_i)^2 ≤ (sum a_i^2)(sum b_i^2). But in our case, we have (sum a_i) / (sum b_i). Maybe I can write it as (sum a_i) / (sum b_i) ≤ something.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio A and try to bound it using the individual maxima.Since each a_i / b_i ≤ 1 / sqrt(2), then sum a_i ≤ (1 / sqrt(2)) sum b_i. Therefore, A = (sum a_i) / (sum b_i) ≤ (1 / sqrt(2)) sum b_i / sum b_i = 1 / sqrt(2).Wait, that seems promising. So, if each a_i ≤ (1 / sqrt(2)) b_i, then sum a_i ≤ (1 / sqrt(2)) sum b_i, which implies A ≤ 1 / sqrt(2).Therefore, the maximum value of A is 1 / sqrt(2), which is approximately 0.7071.But wait, let me verify this. If each a_i ≤ (1 / sqrt(2)) b_i, then sum a_i ≤ (1 / sqrt(2)) sum b_i, so A = sum a_i / sum b_i ≤ 1 / sqrt(2). But does equality hold? For equality to hold in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, all the terms must be proportional. In our case, for each i, a_i = k b_i, where k is a constant. From our earlier analysis, the maximum of a_i / b_i is 1 / sqrt(2), achieved when b_i = 2^{1/4}, which implies x_i = 1 / b_i^4 = 1 / 2. Therefore, if all x_i are equal to 1/2, then each a_i = (1 - 1/2)^{1/4} = (1/2)^{1/4} = 2^{-1/4}, and each b_i = 1 / (1/2)^{1/4} = 2^{1/4}. So, a_i = 2^{-1/4} and b_i = 2^{1/4}, so a_i / b_i = 2^{-1/4} / 2^{1/4} = 2^{-1/2} = 1 / sqrt(2). Therefore, when all x_i = 1/2, each a_i / b_i = 1 / sqrt(2), and hence sum a_i = n * 2^{-1/4}, sum b_i = n * 2^{1/4}, so A = (n * 2^{-1/4}) / (n * 2^{1/4}) ) = 2^{-1/4} / 2^{1/4} = 2^{-1/2} = 1 / sqrt(2). Therefore, the maximum value of A is indeed 1 / sqrt(2), achieved when all x_i = 1/2.Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose n=1, then A = (1 - x_1)^{1/4} / (1 / x_1^{1/4}) = (1 - x_1)^{1/4} * x_1^{1/4} = (x_1(1 - x_1))^{1/4}. To maximize this, we can set the derivative to zero.Let me compute the derivative of f(x) = (x(1 - x))^{1/4}.f'(x) = (1/4)(x(1 - x))^{-3/4} * (1 - 2x).Setting f'(x) = 0, we get 1 - 2x = 0, so x = 1/2. Therefore, the maximum occurs at x = 1/2, and f(1/2) = (1/2 * 1/2)^{1/4} = (1/4)^{1/4} = 2^{-1/2} = 1 / sqrt(2). So, for n=1, the maximum is indeed 1 / sqrt(2).Similarly, for n=2, if we set both x_1 and x_2 to 1/2, then A = [2 * (1/2)^{1/4}] / [2 * (1/2)^{-1/4}] = [2 * 2^{-1/4}] / [2 * 2^{1/4}] = [2^{1 - 1/4}] / [2^{1 + 1/4}] = 2^{3/4} / 2^{5/4} = 2^{-1/2} = 1 / sqrt(2). Therefore, it seems consistent that regardless of n, setting all x_i = 1/2 gives A = 1 / sqrt(2), and this is indeed the maximum.So, putting it all together, the maximum value of A is 1 / sqrt(2), achieved when each x_i = 1/2."},{"question":"Given the family of curves (2(2 sin theta - cos theta + 3) x^{2} - (8 sin theta + cos theta + 1) y = 0), where (theta) is a parameter, find the maximum length of the chord intercepted by these curves on the line (y = 2x).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the maximum length of the chord intercepted by a family of curves on the line ( y = 2x ). The family of curves is given by the equation:[ 2(2 sin theta - cos theta + 3) x^{2} - (8 sin theta + cos theta + 1) y = 0 ]and ( theta ) is a parameter. Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out how this family of curves intersects with the line ( y = 2x ), find the points of intersection, and then determine the length of the chord between these points. After that, I have to find the maximum length of this chord as ( theta ) varies.First, let me try to understand the given equation. It looks like a quadratic equation in ( x ), but it also has a linear term in ( y ). So, it's a parabola or some conic section. But since it's quadratic in ( x ) and linear in ( y ), it's probably a parabola opening either to the right or left, but let me check.Wait, actually, the equation is:[ 2(2 sin theta - cos theta + 3) x^{2} - (8 sin theta + cos theta + 1) y = 0 ]So, solving for ( y ), we get:[ y = frac{2(2 sin theta - cos theta + 3)}{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1} x^{2} ]So, yes, it's a parabola opening upwards or downwards depending on the coefficient. The coefficient is:[ frac{2(2 sin theta - cos theta + 3)}{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1} ]So, the sign of this coefficient will determine the direction. But since we're dealing with a chord on the line ( y = 2x ), maybe the direction isn't as important as the points of intersection.So, to find the points where the parabola intersects the line ( y = 2x ), I can substitute ( y = 2x ) into the equation of the parabola.Let me do that. Substitute ( y = 2x ) into the equation:[ 2(2 sin theta - cos theta + 3) x^{2} - (8 sin theta + cos theta + 1)(2x) = 0 ]Simplify this equation:First, distribute the terms:[ 2(2 sin theta - cos theta + 3) x^{2} - 2(8 sin theta + cos theta + 1) x = 0 ]Factor out a 2x:Wait, let's see. Let me write it step by step.Multiply out the constants:First term: ( 2(2 sin theta - cos theta + 3) x^{2} )Second term: ( - (8 sin theta + cos theta + 1)(2x) = -2(8 sin theta + cos theta + 1) x )So, the equation becomes:[ 2(2 sin theta - cos theta + 3) x^{2} - 2(8 sin theta + cos theta + 1) x = 0 ]Now, factor out 2x:[ 2x left[ (2 sin theta - cos theta + 3) x - (8 sin theta + cos theta + 1) right] = 0 ]So, this gives two solutions:1. ( 2x = 0 ) which implies ( x = 0 )2. ( (2 sin theta - cos theta + 3) x - (8 sin theta + cos theta + 1) = 0 )Let me solve the second equation for x:[ (2 sin theta - cos theta + 3) x = 8 sin theta + cos theta + 1 ]So,[ x = frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} ]Therefore, the two points of intersection are:1. When ( x = 0 ), substituting back into ( y = 2x ), we get ( y = 0 ). So, one point is ( (0, 0) ).2. When ( x = frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} ), then ( y = 2x = frac{2(8 sin theta + cos theta + 1)}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} ). So, the other point is ( left( frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3}, frac{2(8 sin theta + cos theta + 1)}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} right) ).So, the chord is between the origin ( (0, 0) ) and the point ( left( frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3}, frac{2(8 sin theta + cos theta + 1)}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} right) ).Therefore, the length of the chord is the distance between these two points. Since one point is the origin, the distance is just the distance from the origin to the other point.So, the distance ( L ) is:[ L = sqrt{ left( frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} right)^2 + left( frac{2(8 sin theta + cos theta + 1)}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} right)^2 } ]Simplify this expression.First, notice that both terms inside the square root have the same denominator, so let's factor that out:[ L = sqrt{ left( frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} right)^2 left( 1 + 4 right) } ]Because the second term is squared and has a coefficient of 2, so when squared, it becomes 4.So, ( 1 + 4 = 5 ). Therefore,[ L = sqrt{5} cdot left| frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} right| ]Since the denominator is ( 2 sin theta - cos theta + 3 ). Let me check if the denominator can ever be zero.Wait, denominator is ( 2 sin theta - cos theta + 3 ). Let's see, the maximum and minimum of ( 2 sin theta - cos theta ).The amplitude of ( 2 sin theta - cos theta ) is ( sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{5} ). So, the minimum value is ( -sqrt{5} ) and maximum is ( sqrt{5} ). Therefore, the denominator is ( 2 sin theta - cos theta + 3 ), which ranges from ( 3 - sqrt{5} ) to ( 3 + sqrt{5} ). Since ( 3 - sqrt{5} ) is approximately ( 3 - 2.236 = 0.764 ), which is positive. So, the denominator is always positive, so the absolute value can be removed.Thus,[ L = sqrt{5} cdot frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} ]So, now, I need to maximize ( L ) with respect to ( theta ). So, essentially, I need to maximize the function:[ f(theta) = frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} ]Because ( L = sqrt{5} cdot f(theta) ), so maximizing ( f(theta) ) will maximize ( L ).So, let me focus on maximizing ( f(theta) ).Let me denote the numerator as ( N = 8 sin theta + cos theta + 1 ) and the denominator as ( D = 2 sin theta - cos theta + 3 ).So, ( f(theta) = frac{N}{D} ).To find the maximum of ( f(theta) ), I can use calculus. Take the derivative of ( f(theta) ) with respect to ( theta ), set it equal to zero, and solve for ( theta ).Alternatively, since both numerator and denominator are linear combinations of sine and cosine, maybe I can express them in terms of a single sine or cosine function, which might make it easier to find the maximum.Let me try that approach.First, let me express ( N = 8 sin theta + cos theta + 1 ). Let me write ( 8 sin theta + cos theta ) as ( R sin(theta + phi) ) or ( R cos(theta + phi) ). Let's see.Similarly for ( D = 2 sin theta - cos theta + 3 ).Let me compute the amplitude and phase for both numerator and denominator.Starting with ( N = 8 sin theta + cos theta + 1 ).The variable part is ( 8 sin theta + cos theta ). Let me write this as ( R sin(theta + phi) ).Compute ( R = sqrt{8^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{64 + 1} = sqrt{65} ).Then, ( phi = arctanleft( frac{1}{8} right) ). Because in the expression ( R sin(theta + phi) = R sin theta cos phi + R cos theta sin phi ), so comparing coefficients:( 8 = R cos phi )( 1 = R sin phi )So, ( tan phi = frac{1}{8} ), so ( phi = arctanleft( frac{1}{8} right) ).Therefore, ( 8 sin theta + cos theta = sqrt{65} sinleft( theta + arctanleft( frac{1}{8} right) right) ).Similarly, for the denominator ( D = 2 sin theta - cos theta + 3 ).The variable part is ( 2 sin theta - cos theta ). Let me write this as ( S sin(theta - psi) ) or ( S cos(theta + psi) ). Let me use sine.Compute ( S = sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{4 + 1} = sqrt{5} ).Then, ( psi = arctanleft( frac{-1}{2} right) ). Because:( 2 sin theta - cos theta = S sin(theta - psi) )Expanding ( S sin(theta - psi) = S sin theta cos psi - S cos theta sin psi )Comparing coefficients:( 2 = S cos psi )( -1 = -S sin psi ) => ( 1 = S sin psi )So, ( tan psi = frac{1}{2} ), so ( psi = arctanleft( frac{1}{2} right) ).Therefore, ( 2 sin theta - cos theta = sqrt{5} sinleft( theta - arctanleft( frac{1}{2} right) right) ).So, now, substituting back into ( N ) and ( D ):( N = sqrt{65} sinleft( theta + arctanleft( frac{1}{8} right) right) + 1 )( D = sqrt{5} sinleft( theta - arctanleft( frac{1}{2} right) right) + 3 )Hmm, not sure if this helps directly. Maybe another approach is better.Alternatively, perhaps express ( f(theta) ) as:[ f(theta) = frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} ]Let me denote ( A = 8 sin theta + cos theta ) and ( B = 2 sin theta - cos theta ). So, ( f(theta) = frac{A + 1}{B + 3} ).I can write ( A ) and ( B ) as vectors in terms of sine and cosine. Maybe express them as linear combinations.Alternatively, perhaps set ( t = theta ), and write ( f(theta) ) as a function of ( t ), then take derivative.Let me try that.Compute ( f(theta) = frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} )Let me denote ( u = sin theta ), ( v = cos theta ). Then, ( u^2 + v^2 = 1 ).So, ( f(theta) = frac{8u + v + 1}{2u - v + 3} )We can think of this as a function in terms of ( u ) and ( v ), with the constraint ( u^2 + v^2 = 1 ). So, perhaps use Lagrange multipliers to maximize ( f(theta) ).Alternatively, set ( t = theta ), compute derivative ( f'(t) ), set to zero.Let me compute ( f'(t) ):Using the quotient rule:If ( f(t) = frac{N(t)}{D(t)} ), then ( f'(t) = frac{N'(t) D(t) - N(t) D'(t)}{[D(t)]^2} )Compute ( N(t) = 8 sin t + cos t + 1 ), so ( N'(t) = 8 cos t - sin t )Compute ( D(t) = 2 sin t - cos t + 3 ), so ( D'(t) = 2 cos t + sin t )Therefore,[ f'(t) = frac{(8 cos t - sin t)(2 sin t - cos t + 3) - (8 sin t + cos t + 1)(2 cos t + sin t)}{(2 sin t - cos t + 3)^2} ]Set numerator equal to zero:[ (8 cos t - sin t)(2 sin t - cos t + 3) - (8 sin t + cos t + 1)(2 cos t + sin t) = 0 ]This looks complicated, but let me try to expand both products.First, expand ( (8 cos t - sin t)(2 sin t - cos t + 3) ):Multiply term by term:1. ( 8 cos t cdot 2 sin t = 16 cos t sin t )2. ( 8 cos t cdot (-cos t) = -8 cos^2 t )3. ( 8 cos t cdot 3 = 24 cos t )4. ( -sin t cdot 2 sin t = -2 sin^2 t )5. ( -sin t cdot (-cos t) = sin t cos t )6. ( -sin t cdot 3 = -3 sin t )So, combining all these:16 cos t sin t - 8 cos² t + 24 cos t - 2 sin² t + sin t cos t - 3 sin tSimplify:Combine like terms:- ( 16 cos t sin t + sin t cos t = 17 cos t sin t )- ( -8 cos^2 t )- ( 24 cos t )- ( -2 sin^2 t )- ( -3 sin t )So, the first part is:17 cos t sin t - 8 cos² t + 24 cos t - 2 sin² t - 3 sin tNow, expand the second product ( (8 sin t + cos t + 1)(2 cos t + sin t) ):Multiply term by term:1. ( 8 sin t cdot 2 cos t = 16 sin t cos t )2. ( 8 sin t cdot sin t = 8 sin² t )3. ( cos t cdot 2 cos t = 2 cos² t )4. ( cos t cdot sin t = sin t cos t )5. ( 1 cdot 2 cos t = 2 cos t )6. ( 1 cdot sin t = sin t )So, combining these:16 sin t cos t + 8 sin² t + 2 cos² t + sin t cos t + 2 cos t + sin tSimplify:Combine like terms:- ( 16 sin t cos t + sin t cos t = 17 sin t cos t )- ( 8 sin² t )- ( 2 cos² t )- ( 2 cos t )- ( sin t )So, the second part is:17 sin t cos t + 8 sin² t + 2 cos² t + 2 cos t + sin tNow, putting it all together, the numerator is:[First part] - [Second part] = 0So,(17 cos t sin t - 8 cos² t + 24 cos t - 2 sin² t - 3 sin t) - (17 sin t cos t + 8 sin² t + 2 cos² t + 2 cos t + sin t) = 0Simplify term by term:17 cos t sin t - 17 sin t cos t = 0-8 cos² t - 2 cos² t = -10 cos² t24 cos t - 2 cos t = 22 cos t-2 sin² t - 8 sin² t = -10 sin² t-3 sin t - sin t = -4 sin tSo, overall:-10 cos² t + 22 cos t -10 sin² t -4 sin t = 0Factor terms:-10 (cos² t + sin² t) + 22 cos t -4 sin t = 0But ( cos² t + sin² t = 1 ), so:-10(1) + 22 cos t -4 sin t = 0Simplify:-10 + 22 cos t -4 sin t = 0So,22 cos t -4 sin t = 10Let me write this as:22 cos t -4 sin t = 10Hmm, this is an equation of the form ( A cos t + B sin t = C ). I can solve this using the method of expressing it as a single sine or cosine function.Let me write ( 22 cos t -4 sin t = R cos(t + phi) ), where ( R = sqrt{22^2 + (-4)^2} = sqrt{484 + 16} = sqrt{500} = 10 sqrt{5} ).Compute ( phi ):( cos phi = frac{22}{R} = frac{22}{10 sqrt{5}} = frac{11}{5 sqrt{5}} = frac{11 sqrt{5}}{25} )( sin phi = frac{-4}{R} = frac{-4}{10 sqrt{5}} = frac{-2}{5 sqrt{5}} = frac{-2 sqrt{5}}{25} )So, ( phi = arctanleft( frac{-4}{22} right) = arctanleft( frac{-2}{11} right) ). So, it's in the fourth quadrant.Therefore, the equation becomes:( 10 sqrt{5} cos(t + phi) = 10 )Divide both sides by 10:( sqrt{5} cos(t + phi) = 1 )So,( cos(t + phi) = frac{1}{sqrt{5}} )Therefore,( t + phi = pm arccosleft( frac{1}{sqrt{5}} right) + 2pi n ), where ( n ) is integer.So,( t = -phi pm arccosleft( frac{1}{sqrt{5}} right) + 2pi n )But since ( t = theta ) is an angle parameter, we can consider the principal solution.So, ( theta = -phi + arccosleft( frac{1}{sqrt{5}} right) ) or ( theta = -phi - arccosleft( frac{1}{sqrt{5}} right) )But let me compute ( phi ):Earlier, ( phi = arctanleft( frac{-2}{11} right) ). So, ( phi ) is negative, as it's in the fourth quadrant.Alternatively, since ( cos phi = frac{11 sqrt{5}}{25} ) and ( sin phi = frac{-2 sqrt{5}}{25} ), so ( phi ) is in the fourth quadrant.Let me compute ( arccosleft( frac{1}{sqrt{5}} right) ). Let me denote ( alpha = arccosleft( frac{1}{sqrt{5}} right) ). Then, ( sin alpha = sqrt{1 - frac{1}{5}} = sqrt{frac{4}{5}} = frac{2}{sqrt{5}} ).So, now, ( theta = -phi + alpha ) or ( theta = -phi - alpha ).Let me compute ( -phi ):Since ( phi = arctanleft( frac{-2}{11} right) ), ( -phi = arctanleft( frac{2}{11} right) ).So, ( theta = arctanleft( frac{2}{11} right) + alpha ) or ( theta = arctanleft( frac{2}{11} right) - alpha ).Hmm, this is getting a bit involved. Maybe instead of trying to compute ( theta ) explicitly, I can find ( f(theta) ) at these critical points.Alternatively, perhaps express ( f(theta) ) in terms of ( cos(t + phi) ).Wait, another approach: since we have ( 22 cos t -4 sin t = 10 ), which is equivalent to ( sqrt{500} cos(t + phi) = 10 ), so ( cos(t + phi) = frac{10}{sqrt{500}} = frac{10}{10 sqrt{5}} = frac{1}{sqrt{5}} ).So, the solutions are ( t + phi = pm arccosleft( frac{1}{sqrt{5}} right) + 2pi n ).So, ( t = -phi pm arccosleft( frac{1}{sqrt{5}} right) + 2pi n ).Therefore, the critical points are at these ( t ). So, to find the maximum, we can plug these ( t ) back into ( f(t) ) and see which one gives a larger value.Alternatively, maybe express ( f(theta) ) in terms of ( cos(t + phi) ).Wait, perhaps another method. Let me consider ( f(theta) = frac{8 sin theta + cos theta + 1}{2 sin theta - cos theta + 3} ). Let me denote ( u = sin theta ), ( v = cos theta ), so ( u^2 + v^2 = 1 ).So, ( f(theta) = frac{8u + v + 1}{2u - v + 3} ). Let me denote this as ( frac{A}{B} ), where ( A = 8u + v + 1 ), ( B = 2u - v + 3 ).To maximize ( frac{A}{B} ), with the constraint ( u^2 + v^2 = 1 ).This is a constrained optimization problem. So, we can use Lagrange multipliers.Define the function ( F(u, v, lambda) = frac{A}{B} - lambda (u^2 + v^2 - 1) ).Wait, actually, Lagrange multipliers are used for optimizing a function subject to a constraint. So, we can set up the gradient of ( f ) equal to lambda times the gradient of the constraint.But since ( f ) is ( frac{A}{B} ), it's a bit more complicated.Alternatively, perhaps set ( k = frac{A}{B} ), so ( A = kB ). Then, substitute into the constraint.So, ( 8u + v + 1 = k(2u - v + 3) )So,( 8u + v + 1 = 2k u - k v + 3k )Bring all terms to one side:( 8u + v + 1 - 2k u + k v - 3k = 0 )Group like terms:( (8 - 2k)u + (1 + k)v + (1 - 3k) = 0 )So, this is a linear equation in ( u ) and ( v ). Since ( u^2 + v^2 = 1 ), this line must intersect the unit circle.For the maximum ( k ), this line must be tangent to the unit circle. So, the distance from the center (0,0) to the line must be equal to 1.The distance from (0,0) to the line ( (8 - 2k)u + (1 + k)v + (1 - 3k) = 0 ) is:[ frac{|0 + 0 + (1 - 3k)|}{sqrt{(8 - 2k)^2 + (1 + k)^2}} = 1 ]So,[ |1 - 3k| = sqrt{(8 - 2k)^2 + (1 + k)^2} ]Square both sides:[ (1 - 3k)^2 = (8 - 2k)^2 + (1 + k)^2 ]Expand both sides:Left side:( 1 - 6k + 9k^2 )Right side:( (64 - 32k + 4k^2) + (1 + 2k + k^2) = 64 - 32k + 4k^2 + 1 + 2k + k^2 = 65 - 30k + 5k^2 )So, equation:( 1 - 6k + 9k^2 = 65 - 30k + 5k^2 )Bring all terms to left side:( 1 - 6k + 9k^2 - 65 + 30k - 5k^2 = 0 )Simplify:( (9k^2 - 5k^2) + (-6k + 30k) + (1 - 65) = 0 )Which is:( 4k^2 + 24k - 64 = 0 )Divide both sides by 4:( k^2 + 6k - 16 = 0 )Solve for ( k ):Using quadratic formula:( k = frac{ -6 pm sqrt{36 + 64} }{2} = frac{ -6 pm sqrt{100} }{2} = frac{ -6 pm 10 }{2} )So,1. ( k = frac{ -6 + 10 }{2} = frac{4}{2} = 2 )2. ( k = frac{ -6 - 10 }{2} = frac{ -16 }{2} = -8 )So, the possible values of ( k ) are 2 and -8.Since we are looking for the maximum value of ( f(theta) = frac{A}{B} ), which is ( k ), the maximum is 2, and the minimum is -8.Therefore, the maximum value of ( f(theta) ) is 2.Therefore, the maximum length ( L ) is ( sqrt{5} times 2 = 2 sqrt{5} ).So, the maximum length of the chord is ( 2 sqrt{5} ).**Final Answer**The maximum length of the chord is boxed{2sqrt{5}}."},{"question":"There are two two-digit numbers A and B. The frac{2}{7} of number A is equal to the frac{2}{3} of number B. What is the maximum difference between these two two-digit integers?","answer":"First, I need to establish the relationship between the two two-digit numbers A and B. According to the problem, two-sevenths of A is equal to two-thirds of B. This can be written as the equation (2/7)A = (2/3)B.To simplify this equation, I can multiply both sides by 21, which is the least common multiple of 7 and 3, to eliminate the fractions. This gives me 6A = 14B.Next, I'll solve for A in terms of B by dividing both sides of the equation by 6. This results in A = (14/6)B, which simplifies to A = (7/3)B.Since A and B are both two-digit integers, I need to find values of B that make A an integer as well. This means that B must be a multiple of 3. The possible two-digit multiples of 3 are 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, and 99.For each of these values of B, I'll calculate the corresponding A using the equation A = (7/3)B. I'll then check if A is also a two-digit integer.After evaluating all possible values, I find that the valid pairs of (A, B) are:- (70, 30)- (77, 33)- (84, 36)- (91, 39)Finally, to find the maximum difference between A and B, I'll subtract the smallest B from the largest A. The largest A is 91 and the smallest B is 30, so the maximum difference is 91 - 30 = 61."},{"question":"If ( a pm b mathrm{i} ) ( (b neq 0) ) is an imaginary root of the equation ( x^{3} + qx + r = 0 ), where ( a, b, q ), and ( r ) are all real numbers, then ( q ) can be expressed in terms of ( a ) and ( b ) as _______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: If ( a pm bmathrm{i} ) (where ( b neq 0 )) is an imaginary root of the equation ( x^{3} + qx + r = 0 ), and all of ( a, b, q ), and ( r ) are real numbers, then I need to express ( q ) in terms of ( a ) and ( b ). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for polynomials with real coefficients, if there's a complex root, its complex conjugate must also be a root. So in this case, since ( a + bmathrm{i} ) is a root, ( a - bmathrm{i} ) must also be a root. That makes sense because the coefficients are real, so the imaginary parts have to cancel out somehow.Now, the equation given is a cubic: ( x^3 + qx + r = 0 ). Since it's a cubic, there must be three roots in total. We already have two roots: ( a + bmathrm{i} ) and ( a - bmathrm{i} ). That means the third root must be real because the other two are complex conjugates. Let me denote the third root as ( c ), where ( c ) is a real number.So, the three roots of the equation are ( a + bmathrm{i} ), ( a - bmathrm{i} ), and ( c ). Now, I can use Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the sums and products of its roots. Vieta's formulas for a cubic equation ( x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0 ) tell us that:1. The sum of the roots is ( -p ).2. The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is ( q ).3. The product of the roots is ( -r ).But in our equation, the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is 0 because the equation is ( x^3 + qx + r = 0 ). So, ( p = 0 ). That means the sum of the roots is 0.Let me write that down:1. ( (a + bmathrm{i}) + (a - bmathrm{i}) + c = 0 )2. ( (a + bmathrm{i})(a - bmathrm{i}) + (a + bmathrm{i})c + (a - bmathrm{i})c = q )3. ( (a + bmathrm{i})(a - bmathrm{i})c = -r )Starting with the first equation:( (a + bmathrm{i}) + (a - bmathrm{i}) + c = 0 )Simplify this:( a + bmathrm{i} + a - bmathrm{i} + c = 0 )The ( bmathrm{i} ) and ( -bmathrm{i} ) terms cancel out, so we have:( 2a + c = 0 )Therefore, ( c = -2a ). Okay, so the third root is ( -2a ). That's useful.Now, moving on to the second equation, which gives us ( q ):( (a + bmathrm{i})(a - bmathrm{i}) + (a + bmathrm{i})c + (a - bmathrm{i})c = q )Let me compute each term step by step.First, compute ( (a + bmathrm{i})(a - bmathrm{i}) ). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to ( a^2 + b^2 ). So, that term is ( a^2 + b^2 ).Next, compute ( (a + bmathrm{i})c ) and ( (a - bmathrm{i})c ). Let's factor out the ( c ):( c[(a + bmathrm{i}) + (a - bmathrm{i})] )Simplify inside the brackets:( a + bmathrm{i} + a - bmathrm{i} = 2a )So, the expression becomes ( c times 2a ). But we already found that ( c = -2a ), so substituting that in:( (-2a) times 2a = -4a^2 )Therefore, the second equation becomes:( (a^2 + b^2) + (-4a^2) = q )Simplify this:( a^2 + b^2 - 4a^2 = q )Combine like terms:( -3a^2 + b^2 = q )So, ( q = b^2 - 3a^2 ). Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with the roots: ( a + bmathrm{i} ), ( a - bmathrm{i} ), and ( c ). Sum of roots is zero, so ( 2a + c = 0 ) leading to ( c = -2a ). That seems right.Then, for the second Vieta's formula, I calculated the sum of the products two at a time. First term is ( (a + bmathrm{i})(a - bmathrm{i}) = a^2 + b^2 ). Then, the other two terms: ( (a + bmathrm{i})c + (a - bmathrm{i})c ). Factoring out ( c ) gives ( c times 2a ), which is ( -4a^2 ). So, adding ( a^2 + b^2 - 4a^2 ) gives ( -3a^2 + b^2 ). That looks correct.Just to be thorough, let me consider the third Vieta's formula, which is the product of the roots:( (a + bmathrm{i})(a - bmathrm{i})c = -r )We already know ( (a + bmathrm{i})(a - bmathrm{i}) = a^2 + b^2 ), and ( c = -2a ). So, the product is ( (a^2 + b^2)(-2a) = -2a(a^2 + b^2) ). Therefore, ( -2a(a^2 + b^2) = -r ), which implies ( r = 2a(a^2 + b^2) ). That's interesting, but since the question only asks for ( q ), I don't need to worry about ( r ) here.Wait, just to make sure, let me plug the roots back into the equation to see if everything holds. Let's take the root ( a + bmathrm{i} ) and substitute it into the equation ( x^3 + qx + r = 0 ):( (a + bmathrm{i})^3 + q(a + bmathrm{i}) + r = 0 )Let me compute ( (a + bmathrm{i})^3 ). Using the binomial theorem:( (a + bmathrm{i})^3 = a^3 + 3a^2(bmathrm{i}) + 3a(bmathrm{i})^2 + (bmathrm{i})^3 )Compute each term:1. ( a^3 ) is straightforward.2. ( 3a^2(bmathrm{i}) = 3a^2bmathrm{i} )3. ( 3a(bmathrm{i})^2 = 3a(b^2mathrm{i}^2) = 3a(b^2(-1)) = -3ab^2 )4. ( (bmathrm{i})^3 = b^3mathrm{i}^3 = b^3(-mathrm{i}) = -b^3mathrm{i} )So, combining all these:( a^3 + 3a^2bmathrm{i} - 3ab^2 - b^3mathrm{i} )Now, group the real and imaginary parts:Real parts: ( a^3 - 3ab^2 )Imaginary parts: ( 3a^2bmathrm{i} - b^3mathrm{i} = (3a^2b - b^3)mathrm{i} )So, ( (a + bmathrm{i})^3 = (a^3 - 3ab^2) + (3a^2b - b^3)mathrm{i} )Now, adding ( q(a + bmathrm{i}) ):( q(a + bmathrm{i}) = qa + qbmathrm{i} )So, the entire expression becomes:( (a^3 - 3ab^2 + qa) + (3a^2b - b^3 + qb)mathrm{i} + r = 0 )Since this equals zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. So, we have two equations:1. Real part: ( a^3 - 3ab^2 + qa + r = 0 )2. Imaginary part: ( 3a^2b - b^3 + qb = 0 )Let me look at the imaginary part equation:( 3a^2b - b^3 + qb = 0 )Factor out ( b ):( b(3a^2 - b^2 + q) = 0 )Since ( b neq 0 ), we can divide both sides by ( b ):( 3a^2 - b^2 + q = 0 )Therefore, ( q = b^2 - 3a^2 ). Which matches what I found earlier using Vieta's formulas. So that's a good consistency check.Just to be thorough, let me check the real part equation as well:( a^3 - 3ab^2 + qa + r = 0 )We already know ( q = b^2 - 3a^2 ) and from earlier, ( r = 2a(a^2 + b^2) ). Let me substitute these in:( a^3 - 3ab^2 + (b^2 - 3a^2)a + 2a(a^2 + b^2) = 0 )Compute each term:1. ( a^3 )2. ( -3ab^2 )3. ( (b^2 - 3a^2)a = ab^2 - 3a^3 )4. ( 2a(a^2 + b^2) = 2a^3 + 2ab^2 )Now, combine all terms:( a^3 - 3ab^2 + ab^2 - 3a^3 + 2a^3 + 2ab^2 )Let's combine like terms:- ( a^3 - 3a^3 + 2a^3 = (1 - 3 + 2)a^3 = 0a^3 )- ( -3ab^2 + ab^2 + 2ab^2 = (-3 + 1 + 2)ab^2 = 0ab^2 )So, everything cancels out, leaving 0. That's a good sign; it means our expressions for ( q ) and ( r ) are consistent with the original equation.Therefore, after all these checks, I'm confident that ( q = b^2 - 3a^2 ).**Final Answer**The value of ( q ) expressed in terms of ( a ) and ( b ) is boxed{b^2 - 3a^2}."},{"question":"Given two unit vectors overrightarrow {a} and overrightarrow {b} with an angle of 60° between them, calculate the value of (2overrightarrow {a} - overrightarrow {b})cdot overrightarrow {b}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: given two unit vectors a and b, with an angle of 60 degrees between them, I need to calculate the value of (2a - b) · b. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the dot product of two vectors is given by the formula:[overrightarrow{u} cdot overrightarrow{v} = |overrightarrow{u}| |overrightarrow{v}| cos{theta}]where θ is the angle between them. Since a and b are unit vectors, their magnitudes are both 1. That should simplify things a bit.Now, looking at the expression (2a - b) · b, I can use the distributive property of the dot product. That is, for any vectors u, v, w and scalar c, we have:[(u + v) cdot w = u cdot w + v cdot w]and[(cu) cdot v = c(u cdot v)]So, applying this to (2a - b) · b, I can break it down into two separate dot products:[(2a) cdot b - b cdot b]Let me compute each part separately.First, 2a · b. Since a and b are unit vectors, their dot product is just cos(60°). I remember that cos(60°) is 0.5. So, 2a · b would be 2 * (a · b) = 2 * 0.5 = 1.Next, the second term is -b · b. The dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude. Since b is a unit vector, its magnitude is 1, so b · b = 1² = 1. Therefore, -b · b is just -1.Putting it all together, we have:[(2a - b) cdot b = 1 - 1 = 0]Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.1. I expanded the dot product correctly: (2a - b) · b = 2a · b - b · b.2. Calculated 2a · b: Since a · b = cos(60°) = 0.5, multiplying by 2 gives 1.3. Calculated -b · b: Since b is a unit vector, this is -1.Adding them together: 1 - 1 = 0. Hmm, that seems right. Maybe I was overcomplicating it initially, but the steps seem solid.Alternatively, I can think about this geometrically. The vector 2a is just a vector in the direction of a with twice its magnitude. Then, subtracting b from it gives a resultant vector. Taking the dot product of this resultant with b essentially projects it onto b and measures the magnitude in that direction. But since 2a has a component in the direction of b equal to 2*(0.5) = 1, and then we subtract b, which is entirely in the direction of b, so 1 - 1 = 0. That makes sense.Another way to look at it is by using coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to vectors a and b to compute the dot product explicitly.Let’s place vector a along the x-axis for simplicity. So, vector a can be represented as (1, 0). Since the angle between a and b is 60°, vector b can be represented in the plane as (cos(60°), sin(60°)) which is (0.5, √3/2).Now, compute 2a - b. Vector 2a is (2, 0). Vector b is (0.5, √3/2). So, subtracting b from 2a:2a - b = (2 - 0.5, 0 - √3/2) = (1.5, -√3/2)Now, take the dot product of this vector with b:(1.5, -√3/2) · (0.5, √3/2) = (1.5 * 0.5) + (-√3/2 * √3/2)Compute each component:1.5 * 0.5 = 0.75(-√3/2) * (√3/2) = (- (√3 * √3)) / (2 * 2) = (-3)/4 = -0.75Adding them together: 0.75 + (-0.75) = 0So, again, I get 0. That's consistent with my earlier result. It seems that regardless of the method, the answer is 0.Just to make sure, let me try another coordinate system. Suppose I place vector b along the x-axis instead. Then, vector b is (1, 0), and vector a, making a 60° angle with b, would be (cos(60°), sin(60°)) = (0.5, √3/2).Compute 2a - b:2a = (2 * 0.5, 2 * √3/2) = (1, √3)Subtracting b: (1 - 1, √3 - 0) = (0, √3)Now, take the dot product with b, which is (1, 0):(0, √3) · (1, 0) = 0 * 1 + √3 * 0 = 0 + 0 = 0Again, the result is 0. So, regardless of how I set up the coordinate system, the result is consistent.I think I'm confident now that the value is indeed 0. It's interesting because even though 2a and b have components in the direction of b, subtracting b cancels out the projection, leading to a zero result.Just to recap, the steps were:1. Use the distributive property to split the dot product into two terms.2. Compute each term using the properties of dot products and the fact that a and b are unit vectors.3. Combine the results to get the final answer.4. Verify using coordinate geometry by assigning vectors to axes and computing explicitly.This problem reinforces the importance of understanding vector operations and their properties, especially the distributive property of the dot product. It also shows how coordinate systems can be a helpful tool in verifying results.I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all methods point to the same answer. So, I think I'm good here.**Final Answer**The value of (2overrightarrow {a} - overrightarrow {b})cdot overrightarrow {b} is boxed{0}."},{"question":"In the number (2016 * * * * 02 * *), each of the 6 asterisks needs to be replaced with any of the digits (0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9) (digits can repeat) so that the resulting 12-digit number is divisible by 15. How many ways can this be done?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many ways I can replace the six asterisks in the number (2016****02**) with the digits 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9. The catch is that the resulting 12-digit number has to be divisible by 15. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, I remember that a number is divisible by 15 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 5. So, I need to make sure that the number meets the criteria for divisibility by both 3 and 5. Let me tackle each of these one by one.Starting with divisibility by 5. I recall that a number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. Looking at the given number, it's (2016****02**). So, the last two digits are represented by the last two asterisks. That means the last digit is the second-to-last asterisk, right? Wait, actually, no. Let me clarify: the number is 12 digits long, so the structure is:1: 22: 03: 14: 65: *6: *7: *8: *9: 010: 211: *12: *So, the last digit is the 12th position, which is the second asterisk from the end. So, the 12th digit has to be either 0 or 5 for the entire number to be divisible by 5. Got it. So, the last digit is either 0 or 5. That gives me two choices for the last digit.Now, moving on to divisibility by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. So, I need to calculate the sum of all the known digits and then figure out what the sum of the unknown digits needs to be so that the total is divisible by 3.Let me list out the known digits:1: 22: 03: 14: 69: 010: 2So, adding those up: 2 + 0 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 2 = 11.Now, the unknown digits are positions 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12. Each of these can be 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9. Let me denote the sum of the unknown digits as S. Then, the total sum of the number's digits will be 11 + S. For the number to be divisible by 3, 11 + S must be a multiple of 3. So, S must be congruent to (-11) mod 3, which is the same as S ≡ 1 mod 3 because -11 mod 3 is 1 (since 3*4=12, so -11 = -12 +1, so -11 ≡1 mod3).Therefore, the sum of the unknown digits must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. So, S ≡1 mod3.Now, I need to figure out how many ways I can assign digits to the six asterisks such that their sum is congruent to 1 mod3, and also, the last digit (position 12) is either 0 or 5.Wait, so actually, the last digit is part of the unknown digits. So, when considering the sum S, it includes the last digit, which is either 0 or 5. So, perhaps I should handle the last digit separately.Let me think. Let me denote the last digit as D, which can be 0 or 5. Then, the remaining five asterisks (positions 5,6,7,8,11) can be any of the digits 0,2,4,5,7,9. Let me denote their sum as S'. So, the total sum S = S' + D.We have that 11 + S must be divisible by 3, so 11 + S' + D ≡0 mod3. Therefore, S' + D ≡1 mod3, as before.But since D can be either 0 or 5, let me consider both cases.Case 1: D = 0.Then, S' ≡1 mod3.Case 2: D = 5.Then, S' +5 ≡1 mod3 => S' ≡1 -5 mod3 => S' ≡1 -2 mod3 => S' ≡-1 ≡2 mod3.So, depending on whether D is 0 or 5, S' needs to be congruent to 1 or 2 mod3, respectively.Therefore, I can compute the number of ways for each case and add them together.So, let's compute the number of ways for each case.First, let's compute the number of possible assignments for the five asterisks (positions 5,6,7,8,11) such that their sum S' ≡1 mod3, and then the number of assignments where S' ≡2 mod3.But before that, let me note that each of these five positions can be filled with digits from the set {0,2,4,5,7,9}. So, each position has 6 choices, so in total, without any restrictions, there are 6^5 possibilities.But we need to count how many of these have S' ≡1 mod3 and how many have S' ≡2 mod3.To do this, perhaps I can model this as a generating function problem.Each digit contributes its value mod3. Let me consider the generating function for a single digit:Each digit can be 0,2,4,5,7,9.Let me compute each digit mod3:0 mod3 =02 mod3=24 mod3=15 mod3=27 mod3=19 mod3=0So, the digits and their contributions mod3:0: 02:24:15:27:19:0So, for each digit, the possible contributions are 0,1,2.Let me count how many digits contribute each residue:Residue 0: digits 0,9 => 2 digitsResidue1: digits4,7 =>2 digitsResidue2: digits2,5 =>2 digitsSo, each residue has exactly 2 digits contributing to it.Therefore, for each digit, the generating function is:G(x) = 2 + 2x + 2x^2Because for each digit, there are 2 ways to contribute 0, 2 ways to contribute1, and 2 ways to contribute2.Since we have five digits, the generating function for the sum mod3 is [G(x)]^5.We need the coefficients of x^1 and x^2 in [G(x)]^5, which correspond to the number of ways to get a sum ≡1 and ≡2 mod3, respectively.So, let me compute [G(x)]^5 mod (x^3 -1), since we're working modulo3.But perhaps it's easier to compute the number using multinomial coefficients or using roots of unity.Alternatively, since each digit is symmetric in terms of residues, maybe we can find a pattern.Wait, let me think. Since each digit contributes equally to each residue class, the number of ways to get each residue class should be roughly equal, but maybe not exactly because 5 is not a multiple of 3.Wait, let me compute the total number of possibilities: 6^5 = 7776.Since 7776 divided by 3 is 2592, but since 7776 is divisible by 3, the number of ways for each residue class should be equal? Wait, no, that's only true if the number of digits is a multiple of 3, which 5 is not.Wait, actually, no, the number of ways for each residue class can be different because the number of digits isn't a multiple of 3. Hmm, so maybe we need to compute it more carefully.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the generating function is symmetric.Wait, let me compute [G(x)]^5.G(x) = 2 + 2x + 2x^2.So, [G(x)]^5 = (2 + 2x + 2x^2)^5.Let me factor out the 2: 2^5*(1 + x + x^2)^5 = 32*(1 + x + x^2)^5.Now, (1 + x + x^2)^5 is the generating function for the sum of five dice each with faces 0,1,2, where each face is equally likely.But we can compute the coefficients modulo x^3 -1.Alternatively, we can use the roots of unity filter.Let me recall that for a generating function A(x), the sum of coefficients where the exponent ≡k mod3 is (A(1) + A(ω)ω^{-k} + A(ω^2)ω^{-2k}) /3, where ω is a primitive 3rd root of unity.So, let me compute A(x) = (1 + x + x^2)^5.Then, the number of ways to get sum ≡k mod3 is [A(1) + A(ω)ω^{-k} + A(ω^2)ω^{-2k}]/3.But since we have 32*(1 + x + x^2)^5, the number of ways is 32*[A(1) + A(ω)ω^{-k} + A(ω^2)ω^{-2k}]/3.Wait, actually, no. Wait, A(x) is (1 + x + x^2)^5, so our generating function is 32*A(x). So, the number of ways is 32*[A(1) + A(ω)ω^{-k} + A(ω^2)ω^{-2k}]/3.But let me compute A(1), A(ω), and A(ω^2).First, A(1) = (1 +1 +1)^5 = 3^5 = 243.Next, A(ω) = (1 + ω + ω^2)^5. But 1 + ω + ω^2 =0, since ω is a primitive 3rd root of unity. So, A(ω) =0^5=0.Similarly, A(ω^2) = (1 + ω^2 + (ω^2)^2)^5. But (ω^2)^2 = ω^4 = ω^(3+1) = ω^1=ω. So, 1 + ω^2 + ω =0 as well. So, A(ω^2)=0.Therefore, the number of ways for each k is 32*(243 +0 +0)/3 =32*81=2592.Wait, that can't be right because 32*81=2592, but 6^5=7776, and 2592*3=7776, so that would mean each residue class has exactly 2592 ways, which is 7776/3=2592.But that contradicts my earlier thought that since 5 isn't a multiple of 3, the counts might not be equal. Hmm, but according to this, they are equal. So, perhaps my initial intuition was wrong.Wait, let me verify. If each digit contributes equally to each residue, then regardless of the number of digits, the number of ways to get each residue class is equal? That seems counterintuitive, but the math here suggests that.Wait, let me think about a simpler case. Suppose we have one digit: the number of ways to get residue0,1,2 is 2 each, so equal.For two digits: the generating function is (2 + 2x + 2x^2)^2 =4 + 8x + 8x^2 + 8x^3 + 8x^4 +4x^5.But mod3, x^3=1, x^4=x, x^5=x^2.So, the generating function becomes 4 +8x +8x^2 +8*1 +8x +4x^2 = (4+8) + (8+8)x + (8+4)x^2 =12 +16x +12x^2.But 12,16,12 mod3 are 0,1,0. So, the coefficients are 0,1,0. So, number of ways for residue0: (12 +16 +12)/3= (36 +16)/3? Wait, no, wait, the formula is [A(1) + A(ω)ω^{-k} + A(ω^2)ω^{-2k}]/3.Wait, maybe I confused something.Wait, in the two-digit case, A(x) = (1 +x +x^2)^2.Then, A(1)=9, A(ω)=0, A(ω^2)=0.So, the number of ways for each residue is [9 +0 +0]/3=3.But wait, in reality, for two digits, each digit can contribute 0,1,2, so the number of ways to get each residue is as follows:Residue0: 0+0,1+2,2+1: which is 2*2 +2*2 +2*2=12 ways? Wait, no, wait.Wait, each digit has 2 choices for each residue. So, for two digits, the number of ways to get residue0 is:Number of ways where both digits are 0: 2*2=4Plus number of ways where one digit is1 and the other is2: 2*2*2=8So, total 4+8=12.Similarly, for residue1:Number of ways where both digits are1: 2*2=4Plus number of ways where one digit is0 and the other is1: 2*2*2=8Wait, no, wait, if you have two digits, their sum mod3 is1.So, possible combinations:0 +1: 2*2=41 +0: 2*2=42 +2: 2*2=4Wait, 0+1,1+0,2+2: total 4+4+4=12.Similarly, for residue2:0+2,2+0,1+1: same, 12 ways.So, each residue has 12 ways, which is 6^2 /3=12.So, in this case, the number of ways is equal for each residue.Similarly, for three digits, it would be 6^3 /3=72 ways per residue.So, in general, for n digits, each with equal number of residues, the number of ways for each residue is 6^n /3=2*6^{n-1}.Wait, so in our case, n=5, so the number of ways for each residue is 6^5 /3=7776 /3=2592.So, that's why in the generating function approach, we got 2592 for each residue. So, regardless of the number of digits, as long as each digit contributes equally to each residue, the number of ways for each residue is equal.Therefore, in our problem, for the five asterisks, the number of ways where S' ≡0 mod3 is 2592, S'≡1 mod3 is 2592, and S'≡2 mod3 is 2592.Wait, but in our problem, we have two cases:Case1: D=0, so S'≡1 mod3.Number of ways: 2592.Case2: D=5, so S'≡2 mod3.Number of ways:2592.Therefore, total number of ways is 2592 +2592=5184.But wait, hold on. Because D is either 0 or5, each with certain number of ways.Wait, no, actually, D is fixed as either0 or5, so for each case, D is fixed, and the number of ways for S' is 2592.But wait, no, actually, for each case, D is fixed, but D itself is one digit, so for each case, we have 1 choice for D, and 2592 ways for S'.But wait, no, actually, D is either0 or5, so two choices for D, each with 2592 ways for S'.But wait, no, because when D=0, S' must be ≡1 mod3, and when D=5, S' must be≡2 mod3. So, for each D, the number of ways is 2592.Therefore, total number of ways is 2592 (for D=0) +2592 (for D=5)=5184.But wait, hold on, but D is just one digit, so for each D, we have 2592 ways for the other five digits.But actually, no, because D is part of the six asterisks. Wait, no, in the original problem, the six asterisks are positions5,6,7,8,11,12. So, when I separated D as the last digit (position12), the other five asterisks are positions5,6,7,8,11.So, for each case, D is fixed (either0 or5), and the other five asterisks have 2592 ways each.But wait, actually, no, because the number of ways for S' is 2592 for each residue. So, when D=0, S' must be≡1, which is 2592 ways. When D=5, S' must be≡2, which is another2592 ways. So, total is 2592 +2592=5184.But wait, but D is one digit, so for each D, we have 2592 ways for the other five digits. So, total number of ways is 2*2592=5184.But wait, let me think again.Wait, the six asterisks are positions5,6,7,8,11,12. So, when I fix position12 as D=0 or5, the other five positions (5,6,7,8,11) can be filled in 6^5=7776 ways, but we need their sum S' to satisfy S' ≡1 mod3 when D=0, and S'≡2 mod3 when D=5.But as we saw earlier, for each case, the number of ways is 2592. So, for D=0, 2592 ways, for D=5, another2592 ways. So, total is 5184.But wait, but 2592 is the number of ways for the five digits to have a sum ≡1 or2 mod3, each. So, yeah, 2592 each, so total 5184.But wait, hold on, 2592 is 6^5 /3=7776 /3=2592. So, for each residue, it's 2592.Therefore, for each D, which is 0 or5, we have 2592 ways for the other five digits. So, total number of ways is 2*2592=5184.But wait, but D itself is one of two choices, so for each D, we have 2592 ways for the other five digits, so total is 2*2592=5184.Therefore, the total number of ways is5184.But wait, let me cross-verify this.Total number of possible numbers: for the six asterisks, each has6 choices, so 6^6=46656.But we are only counting those numbers where the last digit is0 or5, and the sum of all digits is divisible by3.So, the number of such numbers is equal to the number of ways where last digit is0 or5, and the sum is divisible by3.Alternatively, since the last digit is0 or5, which are two choices, and for each choice, the number of ways the rest of the digits can be chosen so that the total sum is divisible by3.But as we saw, for each D=0 or5, the number of ways is2592, so total is5184.But let me compute the total number of such numbers as follows:Total numbers with last digit0: For the last digit fixed as0, the other five asterisks can be filled in6^5=7776 ways. But only those where the sum of all digits is divisible by3.Similarly, for last digit5: same thing.But as we saw, for each fixed D, the number of ways is2592.Therefore, total is2*2592=5184.So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for the entire number, the last digit is0 or5, which are two choices, and the rest of the digits (positions5,6,7,8,11) can be filled in such a way that the total sum is divisible by3.But since the total sum is11 + S', and S' is the sum of the five asterisks, and D is the last digit.So, 11 + S' + D ≡0 mod3.Which is equivalent to S' + D ≡1 mod3.Which is what we had earlier.So, for D=0, S'≡1 mod3.For D=5, S'≡2 mod3.And since for each D, the number of ways is2592, the total is5184.Therefore, the answer is5184.Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning.Is there another way to compute this?Yes, perhaps using the fact that for each position, the digits are equally likely to contribute each residue, so the total number of ways is roughly total possibilities divided by3, but since we have two choices for D, it's 2*(total possibilities)/3.Wait, total possibilities for the six asterisks is6^6=46656.But we are restricting the last digit to be0 or5, which is2 choices, so total possibilities with last digit0 or5 is2*6^5=2*7776=15552.Then, the number of these where the total sum is divisible by3 is approximately15552 /3=5184.Which matches our earlier result.Therefore, that seems to confirm that the answer is5184.So, I think I can confidently say that the number of ways is5184.**Final Answer**The number of ways is boxed{5184}."},{"question":"Given the system of equations begin{cases} x+2y=k+1  2x+y=1end{cases} whose solution satisfies x+y=3, find the value of k.","answer":"First, I need to solve the system of equations:[begin{cases}x + 2y = k + 1 2x + y = 1end{cases}]And ensure that the solution also satisfies ( x + y = 3 ).I'll start by solving the second equation for ( y ):[2x + y = 1 implies y = 1 - 2x]Next, I'll substitute this expression for ( y ) into the first equation:[x + 2(1 - 2x) = k + 1]Simplifying this:[x + 2 - 4x = k + 1 implies -3x + 2 = k + 1 implies -3x = k - 1]So, ( x = frac{1 - k}{3} ).Now, using the expression for ( y ):[y = 1 - 2left(frac{1 - k}{3}right) = 1 - frac{2 - 2k}{3} = frac{3 - 2 + 2k}{3} = frac{1 + 2k}{3}]With both ( x ) and ( y ) expressed in terms of ( k ), I'll use the condition ( x + y = 3 ):[frac{1 - k}{3} + frac{1 + 2k}{3} = 3]Combining the fractions:[frac{2 + k}{3} = 3 implies 2 + k = 9 implies k = 7]"},{"question":"The time it takes for person A to make 90 parts is the same as the time it takes for person B to make 120 parts. It is also known that A and B together make 35 parts per hour. Determine how many parts per hour A and B each make.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where person A takes the same amount of time to make 90 parts as person B does to make 120 parts. Also, together, they make 35 parts per hour. I need to figure out how many parts per hour A and B each make. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let me try to parse the problem. It says the time it takes for A to make 90 parts is equal to the time it takes for B to make 120 parts. So, if I denote the time as 't', then A makes 90 parts in time t, and B makes 120 parts in the same time t. That means their rates are different because they make different numbers of parts in the same time.I remember that rate is usually calculated as parts per hour, so maybe I can express their rates in terms of t. Let me denote A's rate as 'a' parts per hour and B's rate as 'b' parts per hour. Then, since A makes 90 parts in time t, I can write:a = 90 / tSimilarly, for B:b = 120 / tSo, both A and B have their rates expressed in terms of t. Now, the problem also says that together, they make 35 parts per hour. So, if I add their rates together, it should equal 35. That gives me the equation:a + b = 35Substituting the expressions for a and b from earlier, I get:90/t + 120/t = 35Since both terms on the left have the same denominator, I can combine them:(90 + 120)/t = 35Which simplifies to:210/t = 35Now, I can solve for t. If 210 divided by t equals 35, then t must be 210 divided by 35. Let me compute that:t = 210 / 35 = 6So, the time t is 6 hours. That means A takes 6 hours to make 90 parts, and B takes 6 hours to make 120 parts.Now, I can find their rates. For A:a = 90 parts / 6 hours = 15 parts per hourAnd for B:b = 120 parts / 6 hours = 20 parts per hourLet me check if this makes sense. If A makes 15 parts per hour and B makes 20 parts per hour, together they make 15 + 20 = 35 parts per hour, which matches the given information. Also, in 6 hours, A would make 15 * 6 = 90 parts, and B would make 20 * 6 = 120 parts, which also matches the problem statement. So, that seems consistent.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the steps again.1. Let t be the time in hours for both A and B to make their respective parts.2. A makes 90 parts in t hours, so rate a = 90/t.3. B makes 120 parts in t hours, so rate b = 120/t.4. Together, their combined rate is a + b = 35 parts per hour.5. So, 90/t + 120/t = 35.6. Combine the fractions: (90 + 120)/t = 35 => 210/t = 35.7. Solve for t: t = 210 / 35 = 6 hours.8. Then, a = 90 / 6 = 15 parts per hour.9. And b = 120 / 6 = 20 parts per hour.10. Check: 15 + 20 = 35, which is correct. Also, 15*6=90, 20*6=120, which is correct.Everything seems to add up. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the rates are 15 and 20 parts per hour for A and B, respectively.I guess another way to think about it is by considering their rates. Since A makes 90 parts in the same time B makes 120, their rates are in the ratio of 90:120, which simplifies to 3:4. So, if I let A's rate be 3x and B's rate be 4x, then together they make 7x parts per hour. The problem states that together they make 35 parts per hour, so 7x = 35, which means x = 5. Therefore, A's rate is 3*5=15 and B's rate is 4*5=20. That's another way to approach it, and it gives the same result. So, that reinforces that the answer is correct.Yeah, I think that solidifies the conclusion. So, A makes 15 parts per hour and B makes 20 parts per hour.**Final Answer**Person A makes boxed{15} parts per hour and person B makes boxed{20} parts per hour."},{"question":"A particle starts from the origin in the coordinate plane and moves along the x-axis, jumping 1 unit in either the positive or negative direction each time.

Each jump is 1 unit either positive or negative. I need to figure out how many different ways the particle can move after 5 jumps to land at (3, 0), and similarly after 20 jumps to land at (16, 0). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let's break down the problem. The particle can move either +1 or -1 each time. So, each jump is like a step either to the right or to the left on the x-axis. After a certain number of jumps, the particle's position depends on how many steps it took to the right versus to the left.Let me denote the number of right steps as 'R' and the number of left steps as 'L'. Since each jump is either R or L, the total number of jumps is R + L. In the first case, after 5 jumps, the particle is at (3, 0). So, the total displacement is 3 units to the right.Since each R contributes +1 and each L contributes -1, the net displacement is R - L. We know that R + L = 5 (total jumps) and R - L = 3 (net displacement). So, we can set up these two equations:1. R + L = 52. R - L = 3Let me solve these equations. If I add both equations together, I get:(R + L) + (R - L) = 5 + 32R = 8R = 4Then, substituting back into the first equation:4 + L = 5L = 1So, the particle must have taken 4 steps to the right and 1 step to the left. Now, the question is, how many different ways can this happen? Since each jump is independent, the number of different ways is the number of ways to arrange these steps.In other words, it's the number of permutations of 5 jumps where 4 are R and 1 is L. This is a combinatorial problem, specifically a combination with repetition. The formula for this is:Number of ways = C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!)Where n is the total number of jumps, and k is the number of one type of step (either R or L). In this case, n = 5 and k = 4 (since we have 4 R's). Alternatively, we could use k = 1 for the L's; it should give the same result.Calculating that:C(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * (5 - 4)!) = (120) / (24 * 1) = 5So, there are 5 different ways for the particle to make 5 jumps and end up at (3, 0). That seems straightforward.Now, moving on to the second part: after 20 jumps, the particle is at (16, 0). Let's apply the same reasoning.Let R be the number of right steps and L be the number of left steps. Then:1. R + L = 202. R - L = 16Adding both equations:2R = 36R = 18Substituting back into the first equation:18 + L = 20L = 2So, the particle took 18 steps to the right and 2 steps to the left. The number of different ways is the number of permutations of 20 jumps with 18 R's and 2 L's.Using the combination formula again:Number of ways = C(20, 18) = 20! / (18! * (20 - 18)!) = 20! / (18! * 2!) Calculating this, we can simplify:20! / (18! * 2!) = (20 × 19 × 18!) / (18! × 2 × 1) = (20 × 19) / 2 = (380) / 2 = 190So, there are 190 different ways for the particle to make 20 jumps and end up at (16, 0).Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the first part, 5 jumps with 4 R and 1 L: C(5,4) is indeed 5. That seems correct.For the second part, 20 jumps with 18 R and 2 L: C(20,18) is the same as C(20,2) because C(n,k) = C(n, n - k). So, C(20,2) is 20 × 19 / 2 = 190. Yep, that checks out.I think I got it. So, the number of different ways for the first scenario is 5, and for the second scenario, it's 190.**Final Answer**The total number of different ways after 5 jumps is boxed{5}, and after 20 jumps is boxed{190}."},{"question":"Given the complex numbers (z_{1}, z_{2}) corresponding to points (A, B) on the complex plane, and (left|z_{1}right|=2), (z_{1}^{2}-2z_{1}z_{2}+4z_{2}^{2}=0), with (O) as the origin, find the perimeter of (triangle OAB).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about complex numbers and a triangle's perimeter. Let me try to unpack it step by step. First, the problem says: Given complex numbers ( z_1, z_2 ) corresponding to points ( A, B ) on the complex plane. We know that ( |z_1| = 2 ), and there's this equation ( z_1^2 - 2z_1z_2 + 4z_2^2 = 0 ). We need to find the perimeter of triangle ( OAB ), where ( O ) is the origin.Okay, so let's note down what we know:1. ( |z_1| = 2 ): This means that the point ( A ) is located somewhere on the circle with radius 2 centered at the origin in the complex plane.2. The equation ( z_1^2 - 2z_1z_2 + 4z_2^2 = 0 ): Hmm, this looks like a quadratic equation in terms of ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ). Maybe I can manipulate it to find a relationship between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ).3. The perimeter of triangle ( OAB ): That would be the sum of the lengths ( OA ), ( AB ), and ( BO ). Since ( O ) is the origin, ( OA = |z_1| = 2 ) and ( OB = |z_2| ). So, if I can find ( |z_2| ) and the distance between ( A ) and ( B ), which is ( |z_1 - z_2| ), then I can compute the perimeter.So, the perimeter ( P ) would be:( P = |z_1| + |z_2| + |z_1 - z_2| = 2 + |z_2| + |z_1 - z_2| )So, my goal is to find ( |z_2| ) and ( |z_1 - z_2| ).Looking back at the given equation:( z_1^2 - 2z_1z_2 + 4z_2^2 = 0 )Let me see if I can factor this or express it in terms of ( z_1/z_2 ) or something like that.Let me divide both sides by ( z_2^2 ) (assuming ( z_2 neq 0 ), which I think is safe because if ( z_2 = 0 ), then ( B ) would coincide with ( O ), making the triangle degenerate, which probably isn't the case here).So, dividing by ( z_2^2 ):( left( frac{z_1}{z_2} right)^2 - 2 left( frac{z_1}{z_2} right) + 4 = 0 )Let me set ( w = frac{z_1}{z_2} ). Then the equation becomes:( w^2 - 2w + 4 = 0 )That's a quadratic equation in ( w ). Let's solve for ( w ):Using the quadratic formula:( w = frac{2 pm sqrt{(2)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 4}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 - 16}}{2} = frac{2 pm sqrt{-12}}{2} = frac{2 pm 2isqrt{3}}{2} = 1 pm isqrt{3} )So, ( w = 1 + isqrt{3} ) or ( w = 1 - isqrt{3} ).But ( w = frac{z_1}{z_2} ), so ( z_1 = w z_2 ).So, ( z_1 = (1 + isqrt{3}) z_2 ) or ( z_1 = (1 - isqrt{3}) z_2 ).Hmm, interesting. So, ( z_1 ) is a scalar multiple of ( z_2 ), where the scalar is a complex number with magnitude... Let me compute the magnitude of ( w ).For ( w = 1 + isqrt{3} ), the magnitude is ( |w| = sqrt{1^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = sqrt{4} = 2 ).Similarly, for ( w = 1 - isqrt{3} ), the magnitude is also 2. So, in both cases, ( |w| = 2 ).Therefore, ( |z_1| = |w| |z_2| = 2 |z_2| ). But we know that ( |z_1| = 2 ), so:( 2 |z_2| = 2 ) => ( |z_2| = 1 ).Great, so ( |z_2| = 1 ). That gives us the length ( OB = 1 ).Now, we need to find ( |z_1 - z_2| ) to get the length ( AB ).Since ( z_1 = w z_2 ), where ( |w| = 2 ), let's express ( z_1 - z_2 ):( z_1 - z_2 = w z_2 - z_2 = (w - 1) z_2 )So, ( |z_1 - z_2| = |w - 1| |z_2| )We already know ( |z_2| = 1 ), so we just need ( |w - 1| ).Compute ( |w - 1| ):For ( w = 1 + isqrt{3} ):( |w - 1| = |1 + isqrt{3} - 1| = |isqrt{3}| = sqrt{3} )Similarly, for ( w = 1 - isqrt{3} ):( |w - 1| = |1 - isqrt{3} - 1| = |-isqrt{3}| = sqrt{3} )So, in both cases, ( |z_1 - z_2| = sqrt{3} times 1 = sqrt{3} ).Therefore, the lengths of the sides of triangle ( OAB ) are:- ( OA = 2 )- ( OB = 1 )- ( AB = sqrt{3} )So, the perimeter is ( 2 + 1 + sqrt{3} = 3 + sqrt{3} ).Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes with complex numbers, especially when dealing with magnitudes, things can get tricky.First, I assumed ( z_2 neq 0 ), which is fine because if ( z_2 = 0 ), the equation would become ( z_1^2 = 0 ), which would mean ( z_1 = 0 ), but ( |z_1| = 2 ), so that's impossible. So, ( z_2 ) can't be zero.Then, I divided the equation by ( z_2^2 ) to get a quadratic in ( w = z_1 / z_2 ). That seems okay.Solving for ( w ), I got ( 1 pm isqrt{3} ), which both have magnitude 2. So, ( |z_1| = |w| |z_2| = 2 |z_2| ). Since ( |z_1| = 2 ), ( |z_2| = 1 ). That seems solid.Then, ( |z_1 - z_2| = |w - 1| |z_2| ). Let's verify that:( z_1 - z_2 = w z_2 - z_2 = (w - 1) z_2 ). So, ( |z_1 - z_2| = |w - 1| |z_2| ). Correct.Calculating ( |w - 1| ): For both ( w = 1 + isqrt{3} ) and ( w = 1 - isqrt{3} ), subtracting 1 gives ( isqrt{3} ) and ( -isqrt{3} ), respectively, both of which have magnitude ( sqrt{3} ). So, ( |z_1 - z_2| = sqrt{3} times 1 = sqrt{3} ). That seems right.So, the sides are 2, 1, and ( sqrt{3} ). Adding them up: ( 2 + 1 + sqrt{3} = 3 + sqrt{3} ). So, the perimeter is ( 3 + sqrt{3} ).Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the triangle inequality. The sum of any two sides should be greater than the third.Check:1. ( 2 + 1 = 3 > sqrt{3} ) (approx 1.732). Yes, 3 > 1.732.2. ( 2 + sqrt{3} approx 2 + 1.732 = 3.732 > 1 ). Yes.3. ( 1 + sqrt{3} approx 1 + 1.732 = 2.732 > 2 ). Yes.So, all triangle inequalities are satisfied. That makes sense.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem geometrically. Since ( |z_1| = 2 ), point ( A ) is on the circle with radius 2. The equation ( z_1^2 - 2z_1z_2 + 4z_2^2 = 0 ) can be rewritten as ( (z_1)^2 = 2 z_1 z_2 - 4 z_2^2 ). Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps factor the equation:( z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + 4 z_2^2 = 0 )Looking at it, it's similar to ( (z_1 - z_2)^2 + 3 z_2^2 = 0 ), but let me check:( (z_1 - z_2)^2 = z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 ). So, if I subtract that from the given equation:Given equation: ( z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + 4 z_2^2 = 0 )Subtract ( (z_1 - z_2)^2 = z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 ):Result: ( 3 z_2^2 = 0 ). Hmm, that would imply ( z_2 = 0 ), which contradicts our earlier conclusion. So, that approach might not be helpful.Alternatively, perhaps think of ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) as vectors. The equation ( z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + 4 z_2^2 = 0 ) can be written as ( z_1^2 = 2 z_1 z_2 - 4 z_2^2 ). Maybe express this as ( z_1^2 = 2 z_2 (z_1 - 2 z_2) ). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps think of ( z_1 ) in terms of ( z_2 ). Since we have ( z_1 = w z_2 ), and ( |w| = 2 ), which we already used.Alternatively, maybe express ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) in polar form. Let me try that.Let ( z_1 = 2 e^{i theta} ), since ( |z_1| = 2 ). Let ( z_2 = r e^{i phi} ), where ( r = |z_2| = 1 ) as we found earlier.So, plug into the equation:( (2 e^{i theta})^2 - 2 (2 e^{i theta})(r e^{i phi}) + 4 (r e^{i phi})^2 = 0 )Simplify:( 4 e^{i 2theta} - 4 r e^{i (theta + phi)} + 4 r^2 e^{i 2phi} = 0 )Divide both sides by 4:( e^{i 2theta} - r e^{i (theta + phi)} + r^2 e^{i 2phi} = 0 )But since ( r = 1 ), this simplifies to:( e^{i 2theta} - e^{i (theta + phi)} + e^{i 2phi} = 0 )Hmm, so:( e^{i 2theta} + e^{i 2phi} = e^{i (theta + phi)} )Let me denote ( alpha = theta + phi ) and ( beta = theta - phi ). Then, ( 2theta = alpha + beta ) and ( 2phi = alpha - beta ). So, substituting:( e^{i (alpha + beta)} + e^{i (alpha - beta)} = e^{i alpha} )Using Euler's formula, ( e^{i (alpha + beta)} + e^{i (alpha - beta)} = 2 e^{i alpha} cos beta ). So, the equation becomes:( 2 e^{i alpha} cos beta = e^{i alpha} )Divide both sides by ( e^{i alpha} ) (assuming it's non-zero, which it is since ( e^{i alpha} ) is on the unit circle):( 2 cos beta = 1 )So, ( cos beta = frac{1}{2} ), which implies ( beta = pm frac{pi}{3} + 2pi k ), where ( k ) is an integer.Since ( beta = theta - phi ), this gives ( theta - phi = pm frac{pi}{3} + 2pi k ). Without loss of generality, we can take ( beta = frac{pi}{3} ) or ( beta = -frac{pi}{3} ).So, ( theta = phi pm frac{pi}{3} ).Therefore, the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) is ( frac{pi}{3} ).So, in terms of vectors, ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) have a 60-degree angle between them.Given that ( |z_1| = 2 ) and ( |z_2| = 1 ), the distance between ( A ) and ( B ) can be found using the law of cosines:( |AB|^2 = |OA|^2 + |OB|^2 - 2 |OA| |OB| cos theta )Wait, but actually, in this case, the angle between ( OA ) and ( OB ) is ( theta - phi = pm frac{pi}{3} ), so the angle between them is ( frac{pi}{3} ).Therefore, the distance ( AB ) is:( |AB| = sqrt{|OA|^2 + |OB|^2 - 2 |OA||OB| cos frac{pi}{3}} )Plugging in the values:( |AB| = sqrt{2^2 + 1^2 - 2 times 2 times 1 times cos frac{pi}{3}} )Compute ( cos frac{pi}{3} = frac{1}{2} ), so:( |AB| = sqrt{4 + 1 - 2 times 2 times 1 times frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{5 - 2} = sqrt{3} )Which matches our earlier result. So, that's consistent.Therefore, the perimeter is ( 2 + 1 + sqrt{3} = 3 + sqrt{3} ).Just to recap:1. We started with the given equation and expressed ( z_1 ) in terms of ( z_2 ) using a substitution ( w = z_1 / z_2 ).2. Found that ( |z_2| = 1 ) and ( |z_1 - z_2| = sqrt{3} ).3. Alternatively, by expressing ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) in polar form, we found that the angle between them is ( pi/3 ), leading to the same result for ( |AB| ).4. Checked the triangle inequality to ensure the sides make sense.So, all steps seem consistent and lead to the conclusion that the perimeter is ( 3 + sqrt{3} ).**Final Answer**The perimeter of triangle ( OAB ) is boxed{3 + sqrt{3}}."},{"question":"There are three types of goods, A, B, and C.

From the first purchase, buying 3 units of A, 7 units of B, and 1 unit of C costs 24 yuan, which gives the equation:[ 3a + 7b + c = 24 ]From the second purchase, buying 4 units of A, 10 units of B, and 1 unit of C costs 33 yuan, resulting in the equation:[ 4a + 10b + c = 33 ]To find the cost of one unit of each good, I'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate ( c ):[ (4a + 10b + c) - (3a + 7b + c) = 33 - 24 ][ a + 3b = 9 ]This simplifies to:[ a = 9 - 3b ]Now, I'll substitute ( a = 9 - 3b ) back into the first equation to solve for ( c ):[ 3(9 - 3b) + 7b + c = 24 ][ 27 - 9b + 7b + c = 24 ][ 27 - 2b + c = 24 ][ c = 24 - 27 + 2b ][ c = -3 + 2b ]Finally, to find the total cost of one unit of each good, I'll add ( a + b + c ):[ a + b + c = (9 - 3b) + b + (-3 + 2b) ][ = 9 - 3b + b - 3 + 2b ][ = 6 ]Therefore, the total cost to buy one unit of each good A, B, and C is 6 yuan."},{"question":"Can a triplet of numbers (2, 4, 7) be transformed into a triplet of numbers (2, 6, 9) in any order?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out if I can transform the triplet of numbers (2, 4, 7) into another triplet (2, 6, 9) in any order. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I should probably understand what kind of transformations are allowed. The problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's a general question about whether one triplet can be rearranged or transformed into another. But since it's about numbers, perhaps it's related to arithmetic operations or some kind of number manipulation.Let me consider the simplest possibility: rearrangement. If the order doesn't matter, can I just rearrange the numbers? Well, the original triplet is (2, 4, 7) and the target is (2, 6, 9). So, if I can rearrange the numbers, but in this case, the numbers themselves are different. So, rearrangement alone won't work because the numbers aren't the same.Wait, maybe it's about some operations that can be applied to the numbers to change them. For example, adding or subtracting numbers, or maybe multiplying or dividing. Let me check if there's a way to apply operations to 2, 4, and 7 to get 2, 6, and 9.Looking at the numbers, 2 is common in both triplets. So maybe 2 stays the same, and we need to transform 4 and 7 into 6 and 9. Let's see:- Starting with 4 and 7, can I get 6 and 9?If I add 2 to 4, I get 6. That's good. Then, if I add 2 to 7, I get 9. Perfect! So, if I can add 2 to each of the numbers 4 and 7, I get 6 and 9. But wait, the number 2 is already in the triplet. So, can I use 2 to add to 4 and 7?But hold on, if I add 2 to 4, that's 6, and add 2 to 7, that's 9. But then, what happens to the original 2? If I use 2 to add to 4 and 7, does that mean I can't have 2 anymore? Or is 2 still part of the triplet?Alternatively, maybe I can perform operations that don't consume the numbers. For example, if I can add 2 to 4 to get 6, and add 2 to 7 to get 9, but still keep 2 as part of the triplet. So, the triplet would then be (2, 6, 9). That seems possible if I can add 2 to both 4 and 7 without removing 2.But I need to make sure that the operations are allowed. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe it's assuming that we can perform any arithmetic operations on the numbers, possibly using the numbers themselves as operands.Another thought: perhaps it's about permutations or combinations. Maybe I can rearrange the numbers or combine them in some way. For example, using 2 and 4 to make 6, and using 2 and 7 to make 9. Let's see:- 2 + 4 = 6. That works. So, if I take 2 and 4 and add them, I get 6. But then, what about 7? If I have 7 left, how do I get 9? Maybe I need to add 2 to 7 as well, but then I don't have another 2. Wait, if I used 2 to make 6, I can't use it again unless I can somehow duplicate it.Alternatively, maybe I can subtract. 7 - 4 = 3, which isn't helpful. 7 - 2 = 5, also not helpful. 4 - 2 = 2, which is redundant.Multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8, which isn't 6 or 9. 2 * 7 = 14, which is too big. 4 * 7 = 28, way too big.Division: 4 / 2 = 2, which doesn't help. 7 / 2 = 3.5, which isn't an integer. 4 / 7 is less than 1, not useful.Exponents: 2^4 = 16, too big. 4^2 = 16, same. 2^7 = 128, way too big. 7^2 = 49, also too big.So, maybe addition is the only useful operation here. If I can add 2 to 4 and 7, but without consuming the 2, then it's possible. But if adding 2 consumes it, then I can't have 2 in the final triplet.Wait, maybe the operations can be applied in a way that doesn't remove the original numbers. For example, if I can create new numbers by adding 2 to 4 and 7, but still keep 2, 4, and 7. But that would result in more than three numbers, which isn't allowed.Alternatively, maybe I can replace 4 and 7 with 6 and 9 by adding 2 to each, but then I would lose 4 and 7. But since the original triplet is (2, 4, 7), and the target is (2, 6, 9), I can replace 4 and 7 with 6 and 9, keeping 2 the same. So, in that case, yes, it's possible by adding 2 to 4 and 7.But I need to make sure that the operations are allowed. If I can perform addition on the numbers, then yes. But if I can only rearrange them without changing their values, then no.Another angle: maybe it's about the sum of the numbers. Let's calculate the sum of the original triplet and the target triplet.Original: 2 + 4 + 7 = 13Target: 2 + 6 + 9 = 17So, the sums are different. That might indicate that simple rearrangement isn't possible, but if we can add or subtract numbers, then maybe.Wait, but if we can add numbers, we can increase the total sum. So, if we add 2 to 4 and 7, we're effectively adding 2 twice, which increases the total sum by 4. 13 + 4 = 17, which matches the target sum. So, that seems consistent.So, if we can add 2 to both 4 and 7, keeping 2 the same, then the triplet becomes (2, 6, 9), which is the target. Therefore, it's possible.But I need to make sure that the operations are allowed. The problem doesn't specify any constraints, so I think it's safe to assume that basic arithmetic operations are permitted.Alternatively, maybe it's about permutations with some operations. For example, can I permute the numbers and apply operations to reach the target. But since the numbers are different, permutation alone won't work. So, operations are necessary.Another thought: maybe using the numbers to form equations. For example, 2 + 4 = 6, and 7 + 2 = 9. But that would require using 2 twice, which might not be allowed if we can only use each number once.Wait, in the original triplet, we have 2, 4, 7. If I use 2 to add to 4 to get 6, and then use the same 2 to add to 7 to get 9, but then I don't have 2 anymore. So, the triplet would be (6, 9, something). But we need to keep 2. So, maybe I can't do that.Alternatively, maybe I can perform operations that don't consume the numbers. For example, if I can add 2 to 4 and 7 without removing 2, then it's possible. But in reality, if I add 2 to 4, I get 6, but I still have 2 and 7 left. Wait, no, because if I add 2 to 4, I have 6, but I still have 2 and 7. So, the triplet would be (2, 6, 7). Then, I can add 2 to 7 to get 9, but then I have (2, 6, 9). So, yes, that works.But does that mean I can perform two separate operations: first add 2 to 4 to get 6, then add 2 to 7 to get 9. So, the triplet goes from (2, 4, 7) to (2, 6, 7) to (2, 6, 9). So, yes, that's possible.But I need to make sure that each operation is valid. If I can add 2 to 4, keeping 2, then yes. Similarly, adding 2 to 7, keeping 2. So, it seems feasible.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a transformation where each number can be increased by 2, except for 2 itself. But that would change 2 to 4, which isn't desired. So, that approach doesn't work.Wait, but in the target triplet, 2 remains the same. So, only 4 and 7 are increased by 2. So, if I can selectively add 2 to 4 and 7, leaving 2 unchanged, then it's possible.But how? If I have the numbers 2, 4, 7, can I choose to add 2 only to 4 and 7? Or is the operation applied to all numbers?If the operation is applied to all numbers, then adding 2 to each would result in (4, 6, 9), which is different from the target. So, that's not helpful.Alternatively, if I can choose which numbers to add 2 to, then yes, I can add 2 to 4 and 7, keeping 2 as it is. So, the triplet becomes (2, 6, 9). That seems to be the solution.But again, the problem is whether such selective operations are allowed. Since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's a reasonable assumption that we can perform operations on individual numbers.Another way to look at it is through the lens of permutations and combinations. If we consider that each number can be transformed independently, then yes, adding 2 to 4 and 7 would give us the desired triplet.Alternatively, maybe it's about the possible transformations in a mathematical space, like vector spaces. If we consider the triplet as a vector, can we reach the target vector through some operations. But that might be overcomplicating it.Wait, another thought: maybe it's about the ability to reach the target numbers through some sequence of operations, not necessarily all at once. For example, starting with 2, 4, 7, can I perform a series of operations to get to 2, 6, 9.Let me think step by step:1. Start with (2, 4, 7).2. Maybe add 2 to 4: (2, 6, 7).3. Then add 2 to 7: (2, 6, 9).So, yes, in two steps, I can reach the target triplet.Alternatively, maybe I can do it in one step by adding 2 to both 4 and 7 simultaneously, but that depends on whether simultaneous operations are allowed.But since the problem doesn't specify the number of operations or the way they can be applied, I think it's safe to say that it's possible.Another angle: maybe it's about the parity of the numbers. Let's see:Original triplet: 2 (even), 4 (even), 7 (odd). So, two evens and one odd.Target triplet: 2 (even), 6 (even), 9 (odd). Same structure: two evens and one odd.So, parity-wise, it's possible. If the parity had been different, it might not be possible.Also, the numbers in the target triplet are all greater than or equal to the original triplet except for 2, which remains the same. So, if we can increase numbers, it's possible.Wait, but 7 is being increased to 9, which is a +2, and 4 is increased to 6, also +2. So, consistent increase.Another thought: maybe it's about the differences between the numbers. Let's calculate the differences in the original and target triplets.Original: 2, 4, 7.Differences: 4 - 2 = 2, 7 - 4 = 3, 7 - 2 = 5.Target: 2, 6, 9.Differences: 6 - 2 = 4, 9 - 6 = 3, 9 - 2 = 7.So, the differences are different. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's impossible, just that the spacing between numbers changes.Alternatively, maybe it's about the ability to reach the target numbers through some mathematical relationship. For example, 6 is 2 more than 4, and 9 is 2 more than 7. So, adding 2 to 4 and 7 gives us 6 and 9, keeping 2 the same.So, that seems to be the straightforward solution.But let me think if there's any other way. Maybe using multiplication or other operations.For example, 4 * 2 = 8, which is not 6. 7 * 2 = 14, which is not 9. So, multiplication doesn't help here.Alternatively, maybe combining numbers. For example, 2 + 4 = 6, which is good, but then what about 7? If I have 2 + 4 = 6, I still have 7 left, which needs to become 9. So, 7 + 2 = 9, but I already used 2 to make 6. So, unless I can duplicate 2, which I can't, that doesn't work.Wait, but if I can use 2 in both operations, maybe it's allowed. For example, using 2 as an operand without removing it from the triplet. So, 4 + 2 = 6, and 7 + 2 = 9, while keeping 2 in the triplet. So, the triplet becomes (2, 6, 9). That seems possible if the operations don't consume the numbers.But in reality, if I add 2 to 4, I get 6, but I still have 2 and 7. Then, adding 2 to 7 gives me 9, but I still have 2 and 6. So, the triplet is (2, 6, 9). So, yes, that works.So, in conclusion, it's possible by adding 2 to both 4 and 7, keeping 2 the same. Therefore, the answer is yes."},{"question":"Find the root that the following three polynomials have in common:begin{align*} & x^3+41x^2-49x-2009 & x^3 + 5x^2-49x-245 & x^3 + 39x^2 - 117x - 1435end{align*}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the common root of three cubic polynomials. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:1. ( f(x) = x^3 + 41x^2 - 49x - 2009 )2. ( g(x) = x^3 + 5x^2 - 49x - 245 )3. ( h(x) = x^3 + 39x^2 - 117x - 1435 )Hmm, all three are cubic polynomials, so each can have up to three real roots. Since they are asking for a common root, I need to find a value of ( x ) that satisfies all three equations simultaneously. That means if I plug that ( x ) into each polynomial, the result should be zero for all three.I remember that if a number is a root of a polynomial, then it must satisfy the equation ( f(x) = 0 ). So, if ( r ) is a common root, then ( f(r) = g(r) = h(r) = 0 ).One approach I can think of is to subtract two polynomials from each other to eliminate some terms. Maybe that will help me find a common factor or something. Let me try subtracting ( g(x) ) from ( f(x) ):( f(x) - g(x) = (x^3 + 41x^2 - 49x - 2009) - (x^3 + 5x^2 - 49x - 245) )Let me compute that term by term:- ( x^3 - x^3 = 0 )- ( 41x^2 - 5x^2 = 36x^2 )- ( -49x - (-49x) = 0 )- ( -2009 - (-245) = -2009 + 245 = -1764 )So, ( f(x) - g(x) = 36x^2 - 1764 ). Hmm, that simplifies to ( 36x^2 - 1764 ). I can factor out 36:( 36(x^2 - 49) = 0 )Which is ( 36(x - 7)(x + 7) = 0 ). So, the roots are ( x = 7 ) and ( x = -7 ).Wait, so this means that any common root of ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) must be either 7 or -7. So, if there is a common root among all three polynomials, it must be either 7 or -7. Let me check both possibilities.First, let's test ( x = 7 ):Compute ( f(7) ):( 7^3 + 41*7^2 - 49*7 - 2009 )Calculate each term:- ( 7^3 = 343 )- ( 41*49 = 2009 ) (since ( 7^2 = 49 ))- ( -49*7 = -343 )- ( -2009 )So, adding them up:343 + 2009 - 343 - 2009 = 0. So, ( f(7) = 0 ).Now, check ( g(7) ):( 7^3 + 5*7^2 - 49*7 - 245 )Compute each term:- ( 7^3 = 343 )- ( 5*49 = 245 )- ( -49*7 = -343 )- ( -245 )Adding them up:343 + 245 - 343 - 245 = 0. So, ( g(7) = 0 ).Now, check ( h(7) ):( 7^3 + 39*7^2 - 117*7 - 1435 )Compute each term:- ( 7^3 = 343 )- ( 39*49 = 1911 ) (since ( 7^2 = 49 ))- ( -117*7 = -819 )- ( -1435 )Adding them up:343 + 1911 - 819 - 1435Let me compute step by step:343 + 1911 = 22542254 - 819 = 14351435 - 1435 = 0So, ( h(7) = 0 ) as well. Wow, so 7 is a root for all three polynomials.Just to be thorough, let me check ( x = -7 ) as well, in case there's another common root.Compute ( f(-7) ):( (-7)^3 + 41*(-7)^2 - 49*(-7) - 2009 )Calculate each term:- ( (-7)^3 = -343 )- ( 41*49 = 2009 )- ( -49*(-7) = 343 )- ( -2009 )Adding them up:-343 + 2009 + 343 - 2009 = 0. So, ( f(-7) = 0 ).Check ( g(-7) ):( (-7)^3 + 5*(-7)^2 - 49*(-7) - 245 )Compute each term:- ( (-7)^3 = -343 )- ( 5*49 = 245 )- ( -49*(-7) = 343 )- ( -245 )Adding them up:-343 + 245 + 343 - 245 = 0. So, ( g(-7) = 0 ).Now, check ( h(-7) ):( (-7)^3 + 39*(-7)^2 - 117*(-7) - 1435 )Compute each term:- ( (-7)^3 = -343 )- ( 39*49 = 1911 )- ( -117*(-7) = 819 )- ( -1435 )Adding them up:-343 + 1911 + 819 - 1435Let me compute step by step:-343 + 1911 = 15681568 + 819 = 23872387 - 1435 = 952So, ( h(-7) = 952 ), which is not zero. Therefore, ( x = -7 ) is not a root of ( h(x) ).Therefore, the only common root among all three polynomials is ( x = 7 ).Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake somewhere. Let me double-check ( h(-7) ):( (-7)^3 = -343 )( 39*(-7)^2 = 39*49 = 1911 )( -117*(-7) = 819 )( -1435 )So, adding them: -343 + 1911 = 1568; 1568 + 819 = 2387; 2387 - 1435 = 952. Yep, that's correct. So, definitely, ( x = -7 ) is not a root of ( h(x) ).So, only ( x = 7 ) is the common root. Therefore, the answer is 7.But just to be extra sure, maybe I can factor each polynomial and see if 7 is indeed a factor.Starting with ( f(x) = x^3 + 41x^2 - 49x - 2009 ). If 7 is a root, then ( (x - 7) ) is a factor. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.Using synthetic division for ( f(x) ) divided by ( x - 7 ):Set up coefficients: 1 (x^3), 41 (x^2), -49 (x), -2009 (constant)Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by 7: 7. Add to 41: 48.Multiply 48 by 7: 336. Add to -49: 287.Multiply 287 by 7: 2009. Add to -2009: 0. So, no remainder. Therefore, ( f(x) = (x - 7)(x^2 + 48x + 287) ).Similarly, factor ( g(x) = x^3 + 5x^2 - 49x - 245 ). Let's use synthetic division with 7.Coefficients: 1, 5, -49, -245Bring down 1.Multiply 1 by 7: 7. Add to 5: 12.Multiply 12 by 7: 84. Add to -49: 35.Multiply 35 by 7: 245. Add to -245: 0. So, ( g(x) = (x - 7)(x^2 + 12x + 35) ).Factor ( h(x) = x^3 + 39x^2 - 117x - 1435 ). Let's do synthetic division with 7.Coefficients: 1, 39, -117, -1435Bring down 1.Multiply 1 by 7: 7. Add to 39: 46.Multiply 46 by 7: 322. Add to -117: 205.Multiply 205 by 7: 1435. Add to -1435: 0. So, ( h(x) = (x - 7)(x^2 + 46x + 205) ).So, all three polynomials factor into ( (x - 7) ) times a quadratic. Therefore, 7 is indeed a common root.Just to make sure, let me see if the quadratics have any common roots or something, but since the question only asks for a common root, and we already found 7, which is common, that should be sufficient.But just for my own understanding, let me see if the quadratics have any roots in common. Let's factor them if possible.For ( f(x) ): ( x^2 + 48x + 287 ). Let's see if this factors. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 287 and add to 48. 287 divided by 7 is 41, so 7 and 41. 7 + 41 = 48. So, yes, factors as ( (x + 7)(x + 41) ). So, roots are -7 and -41.For ( g(x) ): ( x^2 + 12x + 35 ). Let's factor. Looking for two numbers multiplying to 35 and adding to 12. 5 and 7: 5*7=35, 5+7=12. So, factors as ( (x + 5)(x + 7) ). So, roots are -5 and -7.For ( h(x) ): ( x^2 + 46x + 205 ). Let's see if this factors. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 205 and add to 46. 205 divided by 5 is 41. 5 and 41: 5*41=205, 5+41=46. So, factors as ( (x + 5)(x + 41) ). So, roots are -5 and -41.So, interestingly, all three quadratics have roots at -5, -7, -41, but each only has two of them. So, the common roots among the quadratics are -5 and -41, but since each quadratic only has two roots, none of the quadratics share both roots. So, the only common root across all three original polynomials is 7.Therefore, I can confidently say that 7 is the common root.**Final Answer**The common root is boxed{7}."},{"question":"In an event, there are 30 people arranged in 6 rows and 5 columns. Now, 3 people are to be selected to perform a ceremony, with the requirement that any two of these 3 people must not be in the same row or column. The number of different ways to select these 3 people is __________ (answer in numerals).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are 30 people arranged in 6 rows and 5 columns. I need to select 3 people such that no two of them are in the same row or column. Hmm, that sounds a bit like a combinatorics problem, maybe similar to permutations or combinations with restrictions. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let me visualize the arrangement. There are 6 rows and 5 columns, so it's like a grid with 6 rows and 5 columns, making 30 people in total. Each person can be identified by their row and column number, like (1,1), (1,2), ..., (6,5). Now, I need to choose 3 people such that no two share the same row or column. So, each selected person must be in a unique row and a unique column.This reminds me of the problem where you have to place objects without overlapping in certain dimensions. Maybe similar to the n-queens problem, where queens can't attack each other, meaning they can't be in the same row, column, or diagonal. But in this case, it's simpler because we don't have to worry about diagonals, just rows and columns.So, how do I count the number of ways to select such 3 people? Let me break it down step by step.First, I can think about selecting 3 rows out of the 6 available. The number of ways to choose 3 rows from 6 is given by the combination formula C(6,3). Similarly, I need to select 3 columns out of the 5 available, which is C(5,3). Once I have the selected rows and columns, I need to assign each selected row to a selected column in such a way that each person is uniquely identified by their row and column.Wait, so after choosing 3 rows and 3 columns, I need to arrange them such that each row is paired with a unique column. That sounds like permutations. For each set of 3 rows and 3 columns, the number of ways to assign them is 3! (which is 6). So, putting it all together, the total number of ways should be C(6,3) multiplied by C(5,3) multiplied by 3!.Let me compute each part step by step.First, C(6,3). The combination formula is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So, C(6,3) = 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720) / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. So, there are 20 ways to choose 3 rows from 6.Next, C(5,3). Using the same formula, C(5,3) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = (120) / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = 10. So, there are 10 ways to choose 3 columns from 5.Now, for each combination of 3 rows and 3 columns, we can arrange the columns among the rows in 3! ways. 3! is 6.So, multiplying all these together: 20 (ways to choose rows) * 10 (ways to choose columns) * 6 (ways to assign columns to rows) = 20 * 10 * 6.Let me compute that: 20 * 10 is 200, and 200 * 6 is 1200. So, is the total number of ways 1200?Wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering permutations directly.Alternatively, I can think of selecting the first person, then the second person, and then the third person, considering the restrictions each time.So, for the first person, there are 30 choices. Once I've selected the first person, the second person cannot be in the same row or column. Since the grid is 6x5, selecting one person removes their row and column, so the remaining grid is 5x4. So, the second person has 5*4 = 20 choices.Wait, but is that correct? Let me see. If I have a 6x5 grid, selecting one person removes their row (which has 5 people) and their column (which has 6 people). But wait, the intersection of the row and column is the person themselves, so the total number of people removed is 5 + 6 - 1 = 10. So, from 30, subtracting 10 gives 20. So, yes, the second person has 20 choices.Now, for the third person, after selecting two people, each in different rows and columns, how many choices are left? Let's see. Each selected person removes their row and column. So, for the third person, we have 6 - 2 = 4 rows remaining and 5 - 2 = 3 columns remaining. So, the grid is 4x3, which is 12 people. So, 12 choices.But wait, hold on. Is that correct? Because when we select the third person, we have to make sure that they are not in the same row or column as either of the first two. So, each previous selection reduces the available rows and columns by one each. So, starting from 6 rows and 5 columns:- After first selection: 5 rows and 4 columns left.- After second selection: 4 rows and 3 columns left.So, the third person has 4*3 = 12 choices.But wait, in the first approach, we considered 30 * 20 * 12, but that would be 30 * 20 * 12 = 7200. But that's way higher than the 1200 I got earlier. So, which one is correct?Ah, I see. The problem is that when I count it as 30 * 20 * 12, I'm considering the order of selection. That is, selecting person A first, then person B, then person C is different from selecting person B first, then person A, then person C. But in the problem, the order doesn't matter; we just need to select 3 people regardless of order.So, in the first approach, where I used combinations and permutations, I got 1200, which is the number of unordered selections. In the second approach, where I considered ordered selections, I got 7200, which is 1200 multiplied by 6 (the number of permutations of 3 people). So, to get the unordered count, I need to divide 7200 by 6, which gives 1200. So, both methods agree.Therefore, the answer should be 1200.But let me double-check my reasoning. Another way to think about this is using permutations. Since we need to select 3 people with no two in the same row or column, it's equivalent to selecting 3 non-attacking rooks on a 6x5 chessboard. The number of ways to place 3 non-attacking rooks on a chessboard is given by the formula:Number of ways = P(m, k) * C(n, k) * k!Wait, no, that might not be the exact formula. Let me recall.Actually, the number of ways to place k non-attacking rooks on an m x n chessboard is C(m, k) * C(n, k) * k!.Yes, that's the formula. So, in this case, m = 6, n = 5, k = 3.So, plugging in the numbers: C(6,3) * C(5,3) * 3! = 20 * 10 * 6 = 1200. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.Alternatively, another way to think about it is:First, choose 3 rows out of 6: C(6,3) = 20.Then, for each of these rows, choose a distinct column. Since we have 5 columns, the number of ways to assign columns to the 3 rows is P(5,3) = 5 * 4 * 3 = 60.So, total number of ways is 20 * 60 = 1200.Yes, that also gives the same result.Wait, so in this case, P(n, k) is the permutation of n things taken k at a time, which is n! / (n - k)!.So, P(5,3) = 5! / (5 - 3)! = 120 / 2 = 60. So, 20 * 60 = 1200.Therefore, regardless of the approach, the number seems to be 1200.But just to ensure I haven't missed anything, let me think about whether there's another perspective.Suppose I model this as a bipartite graph where one set is the rows and the other set is the columns. Each person is an edge between a row and a column. Then, selecting 3 people with no two in the same row or column is equivalent to selecting a matching of size 3 in this bipartite graph.The number of such matchings is equal to the number of ways to choose 3 rows, 3 columns, and a bijection between them, which is exactly what I computed earlier: C(6,3) * C(5,3) * 3!.So, that's another way to see it, and it still gives 1200.Alternatively, thinking in terms of matrices: imagine a 6x5 matrix where each cell represents a person. We need to select 3 cells such that no two are in the same row or column. The number of such selections is the same as the number of 3x3 permutation matrices that can be embedded in the 6x5 matrix.But that might complicate things more, so perhaps it's better to stick with the combinatorial approach.Wait, another thought: sometimes, when dealing with such problems, inclusion-exclusion is used. Maybe I can try that approach to verify.Total number of ways to choose 3 people without any restrictions is C(30,3). Then, subtract the number of ways where at least two are in the same row or column.But that might get complicated because of overlapping cases where two pairs are in the same row or column, etc. So, inclusion-exclusion could work, but it might be more involved.Let me try it.Total number of ways without restrictions: C(30,3) = 4060.Now, subtract the number of ways where at least two are in the same row or same column.First, compute the number of ways where at least two are in the same row.There are 6 rows. For each row, the number of ways to choose 2 people from that row is C(5,2) = 10. Then, the third person can be any of the remaining 25 people (since 30 - 5 = 25). So, for each row, the number of such triplets is 10 * 25 = 250. Since there are 6 rows, total is 6 * 250 = 1500.Similarly, compute the number of ways where at least two are in the same column.There are 5 columns. For each column, the number of ways to choose 2 people from that column is C(6,2) = 15. Then, the third person can be any of the remaining 24 people (since 30 - 6 = 24). So, for each column, the number of such triplets is 15 * 24 = 360. Since there are 5 columns, total is 5 * 360 = 1800.But wait, now if I subtract both of these from the total, I might be overcounting the cases where two pairs are in the same row or column. So, I need to add back in the cases where two pairs are in the same row or column.First, compute the number of triplets where two are in the same row and two are in the same column. Wait, but in a triplet, having two in the same row and two in the same column would imply that all three are in the same row and same column, which is impossible unless all three are the same person, which isn't allowed. So, actually, there's no overlap where a triplet has two pairs in the same row and two pairs in the same column, except for the case where all three are in the same row or same column.Wait, actually, let's think carefully. If a triplet has two people in the same row and two people in the same column, it's possible that one person is shared between the two pairs. For example, person A is in the same row as person B, and person A is in the same column as person C. So, this would form a kind of \\"L\\" shape, with A at the corner.So, in this case, how many such triplets are there?To compute this, we can think of choosing a person A, then choosing another person B in the same row as A, and another person C in the same column as A. So, for each person A, there are (number of people in the same row as A - 1) choices for B and (number of people in the same column as A - 1) choices for C.Since each person is in a row with 4 others and a column with 5 others, the number of such triplets per person is 4 * 5 = 20. Since there are 30 people, total is 30 * 20 = 600. However, this counts each triplet twice because each triplet has two people in the same row and two people in the same column, but each such triplet is counted once for each \\"corner\\" person A.Wait, actually, in each such triplet, there is only one person who is the intersection of the row and column. So, each triplet is counted once for that person A. So, maybe it's not overcounted. Hmm, perhaps not.Wait, let me think with an example. Suppose we have persons A, B, and C, where A and B are in the same row, and A and C are in the same column. Then, this triplet is counted once when considering person A. It is not counted when considering person B or C because B is only in the same row as A, and C is only in the same column as A. So, each such triplet is only counted once.Therefore, the total number of such triplets is 30 * 4 * 5 = 600.Wait, but hold on. If I have a triplet where two are in the same row and two are in the same column, but the third is neither in the same row nor column as the other two, that's different. Wait, no, in a triplet, if two are in the same row and two are in the same column, the third must be in the same row or column as one of them, but not necessarily both.Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me try a different approach.In inclusion-exclusion, after subtracting the cases where two are in the same row and two are in the same column, we have to add back in the cases where both happen, i.e., triplets where two are in the same row and two are in the same column. So, how many such triplets are there?To compute this, we can think of selecting a row and a column, then selecting two people from the row and two people from the column, but ensuring that the intersection is counted correctly.Wait, actually, for each cell (i,j), the number of triplets where two are in row i and two are in column j is C(4,1) * C(4,1) = 4 * 4 = 16. Because in row i, excluding cell (i,j), there are 4 other cells, and in column j, excluding cell (i,j), there are 4 other cells. So, choosing one from row i and one from column j gives 16 triplets per cell.Since there are 30 cells, total number of such triplets would be 30 * 16 = 480. But wait, each triplet is being counted multiple times. Specifically, each triplet is counted once for each cell that is the intersection of a row and column in the triplet.Wait, no. Each triplet where two are in the same row and two are in the same column has exactly one cell that is the intersection of the row and column. So, each triplet is counted once for that intersection cell. Therefore, the total number is indeed 30 * 16 = 480.But wait, actually, no. Because when we fix a cell (i,j), the number of triplets where two are in row i and two are in column j is C(4,1) * C(4,1) = 16. But each triplet is uniquely determined by the cell (i,j) and the two other cells in row i and column j. So, each triplet is only counted once. Therefore, the total number is 30 * 16 = 480.But wait, let me think again. If I have a triplet where two are in row i and two are in column j, then the triplet consists of cell (i,j), another cell in row i, and another cell in column j. So, for each cell (i,j), there are 4 choices for the other cell in row i and 4 choices for the other cell in column j, giving 16 triplets per cell. So, total is 30 * 16 = 480.But in reality, each triplet is being counted once for each cell that is the intersection. But in a triplet, there is only one such intersection cell. So, 480 is the correct count.Wait, but in our inclusion-exclusion, we subtracted the cases where two are in the same row (1500) and the cases where two are in the same column (1800). But some triplets were subtracted twice, once for the row and once for the column. So, to correct for that, we need to add back in the number of triplets that were subtracted twice, which is the number of triplets where two are in the same row and two are in the same column, which is 480.Therefore, applying inclusion-exclusion:Total = C(30,3) - (number with two in same row + number with two in same column) + (number with two in same row and two in same column)So, that's 4060 - (1500 + 1800) + 480.Compute that:4060 - 3300 + 480 = (4060 - 3300) + 480 = 760 + 480 = 1240.Wait, but that's different from the 1200 I got earlier. So, which one is correct?Hmm, this is concerning. There's a discrepancy between the two methods. The first method gave 1200, and the inclusion-exclusion gave 1240. So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion approach.Let me double-check the numbers.First, total number of triplets: C(30,3) = 4060.Number of triplets with at least two in the same row: For each row, C(5,2) * C(25,1) = 10 * 25 = 250. 6 rows, so 6 * 250 = 1500.Number of triplets with at least two in the same column: For each column, C(6,2) * C(24,1) = 15 * 24 = 360. 5 columns, so 5 * 360 = 1800.Number of triplets with at least two in the same row and at least two in the same column: As computed earlier, 480.Therefore, applying inclusion-exclusion:Total = 4060 - 1500 - 1800 + 480 = 4060 - 3300 + 480 = 760 + 480 = 1240.But according to the first method, it should be 1200. So, which is correct?Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion is overcounting or undercounting something.Wait, in the inclusion-exclusion, when we subtract the cases where two are in the same row and the cases where two are in the same column, we subtract too much because some triplets were subtracted twice—those that have both two in the same row and two in the same column. So, we add those back in once.But in our calculation, we added back 480, which is the number of triplets where two are in the same row and two are in the same column. However, the problem is that in such triplets, it's possible that all three are in the same row or all three are in the same column, which we haven't considered yet.Wait, actually, in the inclusion-exclusion principle, when we subtract the cases with two in the same row and two in the same column, we need to consider whether triplets with all three in the same row or all three in the same column have been subtracted appropriately.Wait, in the initial subtraction, we subtracted all triplets with at least two in the same row, which includes triplets with all three in the same row. Similarly, subtracting all triplets with at least two in the same column includes triplets with all three in the same column.Then, when we add back in the triplets with two in the same row and two in the same column, we have to consider that some triplets might have all three in the same row or all three in the same column, which were subtracted multiple times.Wait, let's compute the number of triplets where all three are in the same row. For each row, the number of such triplets is C(5,3) = 10. With 6 rows, that's 6 * 10 = 60.Similarly, the number of triplets where all three are in the same column is C(6,3) = 20. With 5 columns, that's 5 * 20 = 100.So, total triplets with all three in the same row or column: 60 + 100 = 160.Now, in the inclusion-exclusion, when we subtracted the cases with two in the same row (1500) and two in the same column (1800), we subtracted the triplets with all three in the same row three times (once for each pair) and similarly for all three in the same column.Wait, no. Actually, when we subtract the cases with two in the same row, each triplet with all three in the same row is subtracted C(3,2) = 3 times, because each triplet has three pairs, each of which is in the same row.Similarly, each triplet with all three in the same column is subtracted C(3,2) = 3 times.Therefore, in the initial subtraction, we subtracted 3 times the number of triplets with all three in the same row and 3 times the number with all three in the same column.Then, when we added back in the number of triplets with two in the same row and two in the same column (480), we added back in the triplets where two are in the same row and two are in the same column, but not the triplets where all three are in the same row or column.Therefore, to correctly apply inclusion-exclusion, we need to:1. Subtract the number of triplets with at least two in the same row (1500) and at least two in the same column (1800).2. Add back in the number of triplets that were subtracted twice, which are the triplets with two in the same row and two in the same column (480).3. However, we also need to subtract the triplets where all three are in the same row or column because they were subtracted three times and added back zero times.Wait, perhaps it's getting too convoluted. Maybe inclusion-exclusion isn't the best approach here because of the complexity of overlapping cases.Given that the first method gave 1200, which is straightforward and aligns with the permutation approach, I think that is more reliable. The inclusion-exclusion might have some hidden complexities that I'm not accounting for correctly.Therefore, I think the correct answer is 1200.But just to be thorough, let me check with another method.Another way is to think of it as arranging the 3 people in the grid such that no two share a row or column. So, it's equivalent to choosing 3 positions where each is in a distinct row and column.This is similar to selecting a partial permutation matrix of size 3 in a 6x5 matrix.The number of such matrices is equal to the number of ways to choose 3 rows, 3 columns, and then arrange them, which is exactly C(6,3) * C(5,3) * 3! = 20 * 10 * 6 = 1200.Alternatively, using the formula for the number of injective functions from a set of size k to a grid of size m x n.Wait, that might not be directly applicable, but the idea is similar.Alternatively, think of it as a bipartite matching problem where we have 6 nodes on one side (rows) and 5 nodes on the other side (columns). The number of matchings of size 3 is C(6,3) * C(5,3) * 3!.Yes, that's consistent.Alternatively, using the principle of multiplication:First, choose a person: 30 choices.Then, choose a second person not in the same row or column: (6-1)*(5-1) = 5*4 = 20 choices.Then, choose a third person not in the same row or column as the first two: (6-2)*(5-2) = 4*3 = 12 choices.But this counts ordered triplets, so to get unordered, divide by 3! = 6.So, total number is (30 * 20 * 12) / 6 = (7200) / 6 = 1200.Yes, that's consistent as well.Therefore, despite the inclusion-exclusion giving a different result, I think the correct answer is 1200 because the other methods are more straightforward and less prone to error.So, I think I can confidently say the number of different ways to select these 3 people is 1200.**Final Answer**The number of different ways to select these 3 people is boxed{1200}."},{"question":"Given a_n=n(n+1), find the sum a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_9.","answer":"To find the sum of the sequence ( a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_9 ) where ( a_n = n(n + 1) ), I start by expanding the expression for ( a_n ). This gives me ( a_n = n^2 + n ).Next, I recognize that the sum of the sequence can be broken down into two separate sums: the sum of the squares of the first 9 natural numbers and the sum of the first 9 natural numbers. For the sum of the squares, I use the formula ( sum_{n=1}^{k} n^2 = frac{k(k + 1)(2k + 1)}{6} ). Plugging in ( k = 9 ), the sum of the squares is ( frac{9 times 10 times 19}{6} = 285 ).For the sum of the first 9 natural numbers, I use the formula ( sum_{n=1}^{k} n = frac{k(k + 1)}{2} ). Substituting ( k = 9 ), the sum is ( frac{9 times 10}{2} = 45 ).Finally, I add these two results together to find the total sum: ( 285 + 45 = 330 )."},{"question":"Find the a, n geq 1 such that left((a+1)^{n}-a^{n}right) / n is an integer.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: find all integers a and n, where both are at least 1, such that ((a+1)^n - a^n)/n is an integer. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let's write down the expression clearly: ((a+1)^n - a^n)/n. We need this to be an integer. So, for given a and n, when we compute (a+1)^n minus a^n, and then divide by n, the result should be an integer.Maybe I can start by testing small values of n and see if I can find a pattern or some conditions on a.Let's try n = 1 first. If n = 1, then the expression becomes ((a+1) - a)/1 = 1/1 = 1, which is an integer. So for n = 1, any a ≥ 1 will satisfy the condition. That's straightforward.Now, let's move on to n = 2. Then, the expression is ((a+1)^2 - a^2)/2. Let's compute that:(a+1)^2 - a^2 = (a^2 + 2a + 1) - a^2 = 2a + 1.So, (2a + 1)/2. For this to be an integer, 2a + 1 must be divisible by 2. But 2a is even, and 1 is odd, so 2a + 1 is odd. An odd number divided by 2 is not an integer. Therefore, for n = 2, there are no solutions.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. If n = 2, then ((a+1)^2 - a^2)/2 = (2a + 1)/2. Since 2a is even, 2a + 1 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2. Therefore, indeed, no solutions for n = 2.Moving on to n = 3. Let's compute ((a+1)^3 - a^3)/3.First, expand (a+1)^3: a^3 + 3a^2 + 3a + 1.Subtract a^3: 3a^2 + 3a + 1.Divide by 3: (3a^2 + 3a + 1)/3 = a^2 + a + 1/3.Hmm, so that's a^2 + a + 1/3. For this to be an integer, 1/3 must be canceled out somehow, but since a^2 + a is an integer, the entire expression will have a fractional part of 1/3. Therefore, it's not an integer. So, n = 3 also has no solutions.Wait, is that right? Let me compute for a specific a. Let's take a = 1:((1+1)^3 - 1^3)/3 = (8 - 1)/3 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333... Not integer. Similarly, a = 2:((3)^3 - 2^3)/3 = (27 - 8)/3 = 19/3 ≈ 6.333... Not integer. So, yeah, n = 3 doesn't work.How about n = 4? Let's compute ((a+1)^4 - a^4)/4.First, expand (a+1)^4: a^4 + 4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1.Subtract a^4: 4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1.Divide by 4: (4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1)/4 = a^3 + (3/2)a^2 + a + 1/4.Hmm, so that's a^3 + 1.5a^2 + a + 0.25. Clearly, unless a is such that 3/2 a^2 and 1/4 are integers, but since a is integer, 3/2 a^2 will only be integer if a is even, but 1/4 is still a fraction. So, the entire expression will have a fractional part of 0.25, which can't be canceled out. Therefore, n = 4 also doesn't work.Wait, let me test with a specific a. Let's take a = 1:((2)^4 - 1^4)/4 = (16 - 1)/4 = 15/4 = 3.75. Not integer. a = 2:((3)^4 - 2^4)/4 = (81 - 16)/4 = 65/4 = 16.25. Not integer. a = 3:((4)^4 - 3^4)/4 = (256 - 81)/4 = 175/4 = 43.75. Not integer. So, yeah, n = 4 doesn't work.Hmm, so n = 1 works, n = 2, 3, 4 don't. Let's try n = 5.Compute ((a+1)^5 - a^5)/5.First, expand (a+1)^5: a^5 + 5a^4 + 10a^3 + 10a^2 + 5a + 1.Subtract a^5: 5a^4 + 10a^3 + 10a^2 + 5a + 1.Divide by 5: (5a^4 + 10a^3 + 10a^2 + 5a + 1)/5 = a^4 + 2a^3 + 2a^2 + a + 1/5.So, that's a^4 + 2a^3 + 2a^2 + a + 0.2. Again, fractional part of 0.2, so not integer. Let me test with a = 1:((2)^5 - 1^5)/5 = (32 - 1)/5 = 31/5 = 6.2. Not integer. a = 2:((3)^5 - 2^5)/5 = (243 - 32)/5 = 211/5 = 42.2. Not integer. a = 3:((4)^5 - 3^5)/5 = (1024 - 243)/5 = 781/5 = 156.2. Not integer. So, n = 5 doesn't work either.Hmm, seems like for n ≥ 2, the expression is not integer. But wait, n = 1 works for any a. Is that the only case?Wait, maybe I should try n = 6.Compute ((a+1)^6 - a^6)/6.First, expand (a+1)^6: a^6 + 6a^5 + 15a^4 + 20a^3 + 15a^2 + 6a + 1.Subtract a^6: 6a^5 + 15a^4 + 20a^3 + 15a^2 + 6a + 1.Divide by 6: (6a^5 + 15a^4 + 20a^3 + 15a^2 + 6a + 1)/6.Simplify term by term:6a^5 /6 = a^515a^4 /6 = (5/2)a^420a^3 /6 = (10/3)a^315a^2 /6 = (5/2)a^26a /6 = a1/6 remains.So, the expression becomes: a^5 + (5/2)a^4 + (10/3)a^3 + (5/2)a^2 + a + 1/6.Again, unless the fractional parts cancel out, which seems unlikely because each term has different denominators. Let's test with a specific a.a = 1:((2)^6 - 1^6)/6 = (64 - 1)/6 = 63/6 = 10.5. Not integer.a = 2:((3)^6 - 2^6)/6 = (729 - 64)/6 = 665/6 ≈ 110.833... Not integer.a = 3:((4)^6 - 3^6)/6 = (4096 - 729)/6 = 3367/6 ≈ 561.166... Not integer.So, n = 6 doesn't work either.Wait, maybe n = 0? But n has to be at least 1, so n = 0 is not allowed.Wait, so far, only n = 1 works. But let me think again.Is there a way to find a and n such that ((a+1)^n - a^n) is divisible by n?Alternatively, maybe we can consider modulo n.So, ((a+1)^n - a^n) ≡ 0 mod n.Which implies that (a+1)^n ≡ a^n mod n.Hmm, interesting. So, for each a and n, (a+1)^n ≡ a^n mod n.Is there a theorem related to this?Wait, Fermat's little theorem says that if n is prime, then for any integer a, a^n ≡ a mod n.Similarly, (a+1)^n ≡ (a+1) mod n.So, if n is prime, then (a+1)^n - a^n ≡ (a+1) - a = 1 mod n.Therefore, 1 ≡ 0 mod n? Which would imply that n divides 1, so n = 1.But n is prime, so the only prime that divides 1 is n = 1, but 1 is not prime. Hmm, so if n is prime, then ((a+1)^n - a^n) ≡ 1 mod n, which is not 0. Therefore, for prime n, the expression is congruent to 1 mod n, so it can't be divisible by n.Therefore, for prime n, there are no solutions.But what about composite n?Wait, for composite n, perhaps (a+1)^n ≡ a^n mod n can hold for some a.But I'm not sure. Let me think.Wait, for n = 4, which is composite, we saw that ((a+1)^4 - a^4)/4 is not integer. Similarly, for n = 6, it's not integer.Wait, maybe n needs to be 1? Because for n = 1, it's always true.Alternatively, maybe n is a divisor of (a+1)^n - a^n.Wait, perhaps if n divides (a+1)^n - a^n, then n must be 1.But is that the case? Let's see.Suppose n ≥ 2, and n divides (a+1)^n - a^n.Is this possible?Wait, let's think about n = 2 again. For n = 2, (a+1)^2 - a^2 = 2a + 1. So, 2 divides 2a + 1? But 2a is even, 2a + 1 is odd, so 2 cannot divide it. So, n = 2 is impossible.Similarly, for n = 3, (a+1)^3 - a^3 = 3a^2 + 3a + 1. So, 3 divides 3a^2 + 3a + 1. 3a^2 + 3a is divisible by 3, but 1 is not, so 3 doesn't divide the expression. So, n = 3 is impossible.Wait, so for prime n, as I saw earlier, ((a+1)^n - a^n) ≡ 1 mod n, so it's not divisible by n.For composite n, maybe sometimes it can be divisible?Wait, let's try n = 4 again. (a+1)^4 - a^4 = 4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1. So, 4 divides 4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1. Let's see:4a^3 is divisible by 4, 6a^2 is 2a^2 mod 4, 4a is 0 mod 4, and 1 is 1 mod 4. So, overall, the expression is 2a^2 + 1 mod 4. For this to be 0 mod 4, 2a^2 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 4.So, 2a^2 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. But 2a^2 mod 4 can be:If a is even, say a = 2k, then a^2 = 4k^2, so 2a^2 = 8k^2 ≡ 0 mod 4.If a is odd, say a = 2k + 1, then a^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1, so 2a^2 = 8k^2 + 8k + 2 ≡ 2 mod 4.So, 2a^2 is either 0 or 2 mod 4. Therefore, 2a^2 + 1 is either 1 or 3 mod 4. So, 2a^2 + 1 ≡ 3 mod 4 only when 2a^2 ≡ 2 mod 4, which is when a is odd.So, if a is odd, then 2a^2 + 1 ≡ 3 mod 4, which is not 0. If a is even, 2a^2 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is also not 0. Therefore, for n = 4, the expression is never divisible by 4, regardless of a. So, n = 4 doesn't work.Hmm, so maybe composite n also don't work. Let me try n = 6.Compute (a+1)^6 - a^6. As before, it's 6a^5 + 15a^4 + 20a^3 + 15a^2 + 6a + 1.We need this divisible by 6. Let's compute modulo 6.Each term:6a^5 ≡ 0 mod 615a^4 ≡ 3a^4 mod 620a^3 ≡ 2a^3 mod 615a^2 ≡ 3a^2 mod 66a ≡ 0 mod 61 ≡ 1 mod 6So, overall, the expression is 3a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 1 mod 6.We need this ≡ 0 mod 6.So, 3a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 6.Let me test for a from 0 to 5 mod 6, since modulo 6 cycles every 6.a ≡ 0 mod 6:3*0 + 2*0 + 3*0 + 1 = 1 ≡ 1 mod 6 ≠ 0.a ≡ 1 mod 6:3*1 + 2*1 + 3*1 + 1 = 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9 ≡ 3 mod 6 ≠ 0.a ≡ 2 mod 6:3*(16) + 2*(8) + 3*(4) + 1. Wait, but modulo 6:a = 2:3*(2^4) + 2*(2^3) + 3*(2^2) + 1.Compute each term mod 6:2^4 = 16 ≡ 4 mod 6, so 3*4 = 12 ≡ 0 mod 6.2^3 = 8 ≡ 2 mod 6, so 2*2 = 4 mod 6.2^2 = 4 mod 6, so 3*4 = 12 ≡ 0 mod 6.So, total: 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5 ≡ 5 mod 6 ≠ 0.a ≡ 3 mod 6:3*(3^4) + 2*(3^3) + 3*(3^2) + 1.Compute each term mod 6:3^4 = 81 ≡ 3 mod 6, so 3*3 = 9 ≡ 3 mod 6.3^3 = 27 ≡ 3 mod 6, so 2*3 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 6.3^2 = 9 ≡ 3 mod 6, so 3*3 = 9 ≡ 3 mod 6.So, total: 3 + 0 + 3 + 1 = 7 ≡ 1 mod 6 ≠ 0.a ≡ 4 mod 6:3*(4^4) + 2*(4^3) + 3*(4^2) + 1.Compute each term mod 6:4^4 = 256 ≡ 4 mod 6, so 3*4 = 12 ≡ 0 mod 6.4^3 = 64 ≡ 4 mod 6, so 2*4 = 8 ≡ 2 mod 6.4^2 = 16 ≡ 4 mod 6, so 3*4 = 12 ≡ 0 mod 6.So, total: 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 ≡ 3 mod 6 ≠ 0.a ≡ 5 mod 6:3*(5^4) + 2*(5^3) + 3*(5^2) + 1.Compute each term mod 6:5^4 = 625 ≡ 1 mod 6, so 3*1 = 3 mod 6.5^3 = 125 ≡ 5 mod 6, so 2*5 = 10 ≡ 4 mod 6.5^2 = 25 ≡ 1 mod 6, so 3*1 = 3 mod 6.So, total: 3 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 11 ≡ 5 mod 6 ≠ 0.So, for n = 6, regardless of a mod 6, the expression is never 0 mod 6. Therefore, n = 6 doesn't work.Hmm, seems like for n ≥ 2, whether prime or composite, ((a+1)^n - a^n)/n is not integer. So, only n = 1 works.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there are specific a and n where this works.Wait, for n = 1, it's always true. For n = 2, we saw it's impossible because (2a + 1)/2 is not integer. For n = 3, similar issue.Wait, but maybe for some a, even if n is composite, the expression could be integer. Let me try n = 4 and a = 1:((2)^4 - 1^4)/4 = (16 - 1)/4 = 15/4 = 3.75. Not integer.a = 2: (3^4 - 2^4)/4 = (81 - 16)/4 = 65/4 = 16.25. Not integer.a = 3: (4^4 - 3^4)/4 = (256 - 81)/4 = 175/4 = 43.75. Not integer.a = 4: (5^4 - 4^4)/4 = (625 - 256)/4 = 369/4 = 92.25. Not integer.Hmm, same result. So, n = 4 doesn't work.Wait, maybe n = 5 and a = something? Let's try a = 4:((5)^5 - 4^5)/5 = (3125 - 1024)/5 = 2101/5 = 420.2. Not integer.a = 5: ((6)^5 - 5^5)/5 = (7776 - 3125)/5 = 4651/5 = 930.2. Not integer.Hmm, still not integer.Wait, maybe n = 6 and a = 3:((4)^6 - 3^6)/6 = (4096 - 729)/6 = 3367/6 ≈ 561.166... Not integer.a = 4: ((5)^6 - 4^6)/6 = (15625 - 4096)/6 = 11529/6 = 1921.5. Not integer.Wait, 11529 divided by 6 is 1921.5, which is not integer.Hmm, seems like for all n ≥ 2, regardless of a, the expression is not integer. So, only n = 1 works.But wait, let me think about n = 1. For n = 1, ((a+1) - a)/1 = 1, which is integer, as we saw. So, for any a ≥ 1, n = 1 works.Is there any other n where this could work? Maybe n = 0? But n has to be at least 1.Wait, let me think about n = 1. It's trivial because the expression simplifies to 1, regardless of a. So, for n = 1, all a ≥ 1 satisfy the condition.For n ≥ 2, as I saw earlier, the expression is not integer for any a. So, the only solutions are n = 1 and any a ≥ 1.Wait, but let me think about n = 1. Is that the only case?Alternatively, maybe n divides (a+1)^n - a^n. So, for n ≥ 2, is there any a such that n divides (a+1)^n - a^n?Wait, for n = 2, (a+1)^2 - a^2 = 2a + 1. So, 2 divides 2a + 1? But 2a + 1 is odd, so no.n = 3: (a+1)^3 - a^3 = 3a^2 + 3a + 1. 3 divides 3a^2 + 3a + 1? 3a^2 + 3a is divisible by 3, but 1 is not, so no.n = 4: 4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1. 4 divides this? As we saw earlier, 4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1 ≡ 2a^2 + 1 mod 4. For this to be 0 mod 4, 2a^2 ≡ 3 mod 4. But 2a^2 is either 0 or 2 mod 4, so no solution.n = 5: 5a^4 + 10a^3 + 10a^2 + 5a + 1. 5 divides this? Let's compute mod 5:Each term:5a^4 ≡ 0 mod 510a^3 ≡ 0 mod 510a^2 ≡ 0 mod 55a ≡ 0 mod 51 ≡ 1 mod 5So, total ≡ 1 mod 5. Therefore, 5 doesn't divide the expression.Similarly, for n = 6, as we saw, it's not divisible by 6.Wait, so for n ≥ 2, regardless of a, n does not divide (a+1)^n - a^n. Therefore, the only solution is n = 1, with any a ≥ 1.Therefore, the answer is all pairs (a, n) where n = 1 and a is any integer greater than or equal to 1.**Final Answer**The solutions are all positive integers (a) with (n = 1). Thus, the answer is (boxed{n = 1}) for any (a geq 1).**Final Answer**The solutions are all positive integers (a) with (n = 1). Thus, the answer is (boxed{n = 1}) for any (a geq 1)."},{"question":"The maximum value of the function ( y = frac{3x^2 + 3x + 4}{x^2 + x + 1} ) is(A) ( 4 frac{1}{3} ).(B) 4.(C) ( 3 frac{3}{4} ).(D) 3.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the maximum value of the function ( y = frac{3x^2 + 3x + 4}{x^2 + x + 1} ). The options are given as (A) ( 4 frac{1}{3} ), (B) 4, (C) ( 3 frac{3}{4} ), and (D) 3. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with rational functions like this, one method to find maxima or minima is to use calculus, specifically finding the derivative and setting it equal to zero to find critical points. But since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe there's a simpler way without calculus? Let me see.Alternatively, I can try rewriting the function in a way that might make it easier to analyze. Maybe by expressing it as a constant plus a fraction. Let me try that.So, the function is ( y = frac{3x^2 + 3x + 4}{x^2 + x + 1} ). Let me see if I can split this into a polynomial plus a proper fraction.Looking at the numerator and denominator, both are quadratic. So, maybe I can perform polynomial division or express it as ( y = A + frac{Bx + C}{x^2 + x + 1} ), where A, B, and C are constants.Let me try that. Let me write:( y = A + frac{Bx + C}{x^2 + x + 1} )Multiplying both sides by the denominator:( 3x^2 + 3x + 4 = A(x^2 + x + 1) + Bx + C )Expanding the right side:( 3x^2 + 3x + 4 = A x^2 + A x + A + Bx + C )Combine like terms:( 3x^2 + 3x + 4 = (A)x^2 + (A + B)x + (A + C) )Now, equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of x:For ( x^2 ): 3 = AFor x: 3 = A + BFor constant term: 4 = A + CSo, from the first equation, A = 3.Then, plug A = 3 into the second equation: 3 = 3 + B => B = 0.Similarly, plug A = 3 into the third equation: 4 = 3 + C => C = 1.So, now we have:( y = 3 + frac{0x + 1}{x^2 + x + 1} = 3 + frac{1}{x^2 + x + 1} )Okay, so the function simplifies to ( y = 3 + frac{1}{x^2 + x + 1} ). That seems simpler. Now, to find the maximum value of y, I need to find the maximum value of ( frac{1}{x^2 + x + 1} ), since 3 is a constant.But wait, the maximum value of ( frac{1}{x^2 + x + 1} ) occurs when the denominator ( x^2 + x + 1 ) is minimized, because as the denominator gets smaller, the fraction gets larger. So, I need to find the minimum value of ( x^2 + x + 1 ).To find the minimum of the quadratic ( x^2 + x + 1 ), I can use the vertex formula. The x-coordinate of the vertex is at ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ), where a = 1, b = 1.So, x = -1/(2*1) = -1/2.Now, plug x = -1/2 into the quadratic to find the minimum value:( (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2) + 1 = 1/4 - 1/2 + 1 = (1/4 - 2/4) + 4/4 = (-1/4) + 4/4 = 3/4.So, the minimum value of the denominator is 3/4. Therefore, the maximum value of ( frac{1}{x^2 + x + 1} ) is ( frac{1}{3/4} = 4/3 ).Therefore, the maximum value of y is 3 + 4/3 = 3 + 1 1/3 = 4 1/3.Wait, but looking back at the options, (A) is 4 1/3, which is what I got. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake in my calculations.So, starting from the beginning, I expressed y as 3 + 1/(x² + x + 1). Then, I found that the denominator has a minimum at x = -1/2, which gives 3/4, so 1/(3/4) is 4/3. Adding that to 3 gives 3 + 4/3, which is 13/3, which is 4 1/3. So, that seems correct.But wait, another thought: since the denominator is always positive (because x² + x + 1 is always positive, as its discriminant is 1 - 4 = -3 < 0, so no real roots, and since the coefficient of x² is positive, it's always positive). Therefore, ( frac{1}{x^2 + x + 1} ) is always positive, and its maximum is indeed 4/3.So, y can be as large as 3 + 4/3, which is 13/3 or 4 1/3, which is option (A). But wait, the options are (A) 4 1/3, (B) 4, (C) 3 3/4, (D) 3.Wait, but I just thought of another way: maybe I can use calculus to verify. Let me try that.So, the function is y = (3x² + 3x + 4)/(x² + x + 1). Let me compute its derivative.Using the quotient rule: if y = u/v, then y’ = (u’v - uv’)/v².So, u = 3x² + 3x + 4, so u’ = 6x + 3.v = x² + x + 1, so v’ = 2x + 1.Therefore, y’ = [ (6x + 3)(x² + x + 1) - (3x² + 3x + 4)(2x + 1) ] / (x² + x + 1)^2.Let me compute the numerator:First, expand (6x + 3)(x² + x + 1):= 6x*(x²) + 6x*(x) + 6x*(1) + 3*(x²) + 3*(x) + 3*(1)= 6x³ + 6x² + 6x + 3x² + 3x + 3Combine like terms:6x³ + (6x² + 3x²) + (6x + 3x) + 3= 6x³ + 9x² + 9x + 3Now, expand (3x² + 3x + 4)(2x + 1):= 3x²*(2x) + 3x²*(1) + 3x*(2x) + 3x*(1) + 4*(2x) + 4*(1)= 6x³ + 3x² + 6x² + 3x + 8x + 4Combine like terms:6x³ + (3x² + 6x²) + (3x + 8x) + 4= 6x³ + 9x² + 11x + 4Now, subtract the second expansion from the first:Numerator = (6x³ + 9x² + 9x + 3) - (6x³ + 9x² + 11x + 4)= 6x³ - 6x³ + 9x² - 9x² + 9x - 11x + 3 - 4= 0x³ + 0x² - 2x -1So, numerator = -2x -1.Therefore, y’ = (-2x -1)/(x² + x + 1)^2.To find critical points, set y’ = 0:-2x -1 = 0 => -2x = 1 => x = -1/2.So, the critical point is at x = -1/2. Now, let's check if this is a maximum or minimum.Since the denominator (x² + x + 1)^2 is always positive, the sign of y’ depends on the numerator, which is -2x -1.So, when x < -1/2, say x = -1, plug into numerator: -2*(-1) -1 = 2 -1 = 1 > 0, so y’ > 0.When x > -1/2, say x = 0, numerator: -2*0 -1 = -1 < 0, so y’ < 0.Therefore, the function is increasing before x = -1/2 and decreasing after x = -1/2, so x = -1/2 is a maximum point.Therefore, the maximum value occurs at x = -1/2. Let me compute y at x = -1/2.Compute numerator: 3x² + 3x + 4.x = -1/2, so x² = 1/4.So, numerator = 3*(1/4) + 3*(-1/2) + 4 = 3/4 - 3/2 + 4.Convert to quarters: 3/4 - 6/4 + 16/4 = (3 -6 +16)/4 = 13/4.Denominator: x² + x + 1 = 1/4 + (-1/2) +1 = 1/4 - 2/4 + 4/4 = (1 -2 +4)/4 = 3/4.Therefore, y = (13/4)/(3/4) = 13/4 * 4/3 = 13/3 = 4 1/3.So, that's consistent with my earlier result. So, the maximum value is 4 1/3, which is option (A).Wait, but let me just check if there are any other critical points or if this is indeed the global maximum.Since as x approaches infinity, the function y behaves like 3x²/x² = 3, so y approaches 3. Similarly, as x approaches negative infinity, y also approaches 3. Therefore, the function has a maximum at x = -1/2, which is 4 1/3, and tends to 3 at both ends. So, yes, 4 1/3 is the maximum value.Therefore, the correct answer should be (A) 4 1/3.But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes when computing the numerator and denominator at x = -1/2.Numerator: 3x² + 3x +4.x = -1/2, so x² = 1/4.3*(1/4) = 3/4.3x = 3*(-1/2) = -3/2.So, 3/4 - 3/2 + 4.Convert to quarters: 3/4 - 6/4 + 16/4 = (3 -6 +16)/4 = 13/4. That's correct.Denominator: x² +x +1 = 1/4 + (-1/2) +1 = 1/4 - 2/4 + 4/4 = (1 -2 +4)/4 = 3/4. That's correct.So, y = (13/4)/(3/4) = 13/3, which is 4 1/3. So, yes, correct.Alternatively, another way to think about this problem is to consider that since the function is a rational function where both numerator and denominator are quadratics, the function can be expressed as a linear function plus a proper fraction, as I did earlier, which simplifies the analysis.So, in conclusion, the maximum value is 4 1/3, which is option (A).**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Given the sequence:begin{array}{l}frac{2}{3}, frac{2}{9}, frac{4}{9}, frac{6}{9}, frac{8}{9}, frac{2}{27}, frac{4}{27}, cdots, frac{26}{27}, cdots, frac{2}{3^{n}}, frac{4}{3^{n}}, cdots, frac{3^{n}-1}{3^{n}}, cdots . quad text{Find which term in this sequence is } frac{2020}{2187}.end{array}","answer":"Alright, so I have this sequence here: 2/3, 2/9, 4/9, 6/9, 8/9, 2/27, 4/27, ..., 26/27, ..., 2/3^n, 4/3^n, ..., (3^n - 1)/3^n, and so on.

The numerator is 2, so that's just 2/3. Then the next group has denominator 9. Numerators are 2, 4, 6, 8. So that's four terms: 2/9, 4/9, 6/9, 8/9. Then the next group has denominator 27. Numerators start at 2 and go up by 2 each time: 2, 4, 6, ..., up to 26. So that's 13 terms because (26 - 2)/2 + 1 = 13. Wait, 26 is 3^3 - 1, which is 27 - 1 = 26. So each group with denominator 3^n has numerators from 2 to 3^n - 1, stepping by 2 each time.So, the number of terms in each group is (3^n - 1 - 2)/2 + 1 = (3^n - 3)/2 + 1 = (3^n - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3 - 1)/2 = 1, which is correct because the first group has only one term. For n=2: (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches the four terms in the second group. For n=3: (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which is correct as well. So, each group n has (3^n - 1)/2 terms.Now, the sequence is built by concatenating these groups. So, the first group (n=1) has 1 term, the second group (n=2) has 4 terms, the third group (n=3) has 13 terms, and so on. So, to find the position of 2020/2187, I need to figure out which group it's in and then its position within that group.First, let's note that 2187 is 3^7 because 3^7 = 2187. So, 2020/2187 is in the group where n=7. So, the denominator is 3^7, numerator is 2020.Wait, but hold on. The numerators in each group go up to 3^n - 1. For n=7, 3^7 is 2187, so the maximum numerator is 2186. 2020 is less than 2186, so it's a valid numerator in that group.Now, within the group n=7, the numerators start at 2 and go up by 2 each time: 2, 4, 6, ..., 2020, ..., 2186. So, how many terms are there before 2020 in this group?Well, the numerators are an arithmetic sequence starting at 2, with a common difference of 2. So, the number of terms up to 2020 is given by:Number of terms = ((2020 - 2)/2) + 1 = (2018/2) + 1 = 1009 + 1 = 1010.Wait, so 2020 is the 1010th term in the group n=7.But before that, we have all the previous groups. So, we need to calculate the total number of terms in all groups before n=7 and then add 1010 to get the position of 2020/2187 in the entire sequence.So, let's compute the number of terms in each group from n=1 to n=6.For each n, the number of terms is (3^n - 1)/2.Let me compute that for n=1 to n=6:n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1n=2: (9 - 1)/2 = 4n=3: (27 - 1)/2 = 13n=4: (81 - 1)/2 = 40n=5: (243 - 1)/2 = 121n=6: (729 - 1)/2 = 364Wait, let me verify n=4: 3^4 is 81, so (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.Similarly, n=5: 243 -1 = 242, 242/2 = 121. Correct.n=6: 729 -1 = 728, 728/2 = 364. Correct.So, the number of terms before group n=7 is the sum of terms from n=1 to n=6.Let me compute that:n=1: 1n=2: 4 (total so far: 5)n=3: 13 (total: 18)n=4: 40 (total: 58)n=5: 121 (total: 179)n=6: 364 (total: 179 + 364 = 543)So, before group n=7, there are 543 terms.Within group n=7, 2020 is the 1010th term.Therefore, the position of 2020/2187 in the entire sequence is 543 + 1010 = 1553.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that.Wait, the number of terms before group n=7 is 543, and within group n=7, 2020 is the 1010th term, so the total position is 543 + 1010 = 1553. Hmm, but let me make sure that 2020 is indeed the 1010th term in group n=7.Wait, the numerators in group n=7 start at 2 and go up by 2 each time. So, the sequence is 2, 4, 6, ..., 2020, ..., 2186.The number of terms up to 2020 is ((2020 - 2)/2) + 1 = (2018)/2 + 1 = 1009 + 1 = 1010. So, yes, 1010 terms.So, adding the 543 terms before group n=7, we get 543 + 1010 = 1553.Wait, but let me think again. When we add 543 terms before group n=7, and then the 1010th term in group n=7 is the 543 + 1010 = 1553rd term in the entire sequence.Is that correct? Hmm.Wait, let me think about how the groups are structured.Group n=1: 1 term (position 1)Group n=2: 4 terms (positions 2-5)Group n=3: 13 terms (positions 6-18)Group n=4: 40 terms (positions 19-58)Group n=5: 121 terms (positions 59-179)Group n=6: 364 terms (positions 180-543)Group n=7: starts at position 544.So, group n=7 has (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 terms. So, group n=7 has 1093 terms, starting at position 544.So, the 1010th term in group n=7 is at position 543 + 1010 = 1553.Wait, but 543 + 1093 = 1636, so group n=7 ends at position 1636. So, 1010 is within 1 to 1093, so yes, 1553 is correct.But let me make sure that 2020 is indeed the 1010th term in group n=7.The numerators in group n=7 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2186. So, the nth numerator is 2n. So, to find the term where numerator is 2020, we have 2n = 2020, so n = 1010. So, yes, 2020 is the 1010th numerator in group n=7.Therefore, the position is 543 + 1010 = 1553.Wait, but hold on. Let me think again about the starting point of group n=7.Group n=1: 1 term (position 1)Group n=2: 4 terms (positions 2-5)Group n=3: 13 terms (positions 6-18)Group n=4: 40 terms (positions 19-58)Group n=5: 121 terms (positions 59-179)Group n=6: 364 terms (positions 180-543)Group n=7: starts at position 544.So, the first term of group n=7 is at position 544, which is 2/2187.Then, each subsequent term increases the numerator by 2. So, the k-th term in group n=7 is (2k)/2187.We need to find k such that 2k = 2020. So, k = 1010.Therefore, the term 2020/2187 is the 1010th term in group n=7, which is at position 543 + 1010 = 1553.Wait, but let me check the addition: 543 + 1010. 543 + 1000 = 1543, plus 10 is 1553. Correct.So, I think 1553 is the position.But just to make sure, let me compute the total number of terms up to group n=6: 1 + 4 + 13 + 40 + 121 + 364.Let me add them step by step:1 + 4 = 55 + 13 = 1818 + 40 = 5858 + 121 = 179179 + 364 = 543Yes, that's correct. So, 543 terms before group n=7.Then, in group n=7, term number 1010 is 2020/2187, so total position is 543 + 1010 = 1553.Therefore, the term 2020/2187 is the 1553rd term in the sequence.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me think about the structure again.Each group n has (3^n - 1)/2 terms. So, for n=1: (3 - 1)/2 = 1, n=2: (9 - 1)/2 = 4, n=3: (27 - 1)/2 = 13, n=4: (81 - 1)/2 = 40, n=5: (243 - 1)/2 = 121, n=6: (729 - 1)/2 = 364, n=7: (2187 - 1)/2 = 1093.So, the total number of terms up to group n=6 is 1 + 4 + 13 + 40 + 121 + 364 = 543.Then, group n=7 has 1093 terms, starting at position 544.So, term number k in group n=7 is at position 543 + k.We found that 2020 is the 1010th term in group n=7, so position is 543 + 1010 = 1553.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, let me think about the numerators in group n=7: they are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2186.So, the numerators form an arithmetic progression with first term 2, common difference 2, last term 2186.The number of terms is ((2186 - 2)/2) + 1 = (2184)/2 + 1 = 1092 + 1 = 1093, which matches.So, to find the term where numerator is 2020, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic progression:a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)dHere, a_n = 2020, a_1 = 2, d = 2.So,2020 = 2 + (n - 1)*22020 - 2 = (n - 1)*22018 = (n - 1)*2n - 1 = 1009n = 1010So, yes, 2020 is the 1010th term in group n=7.Therefore, the position is 543 + 1010 = 1553.I think that's solid. So, the term 2020/2187 is the 1553rd term in the sequence.**Final Answer**The term (frac{2020}{2187}) is the boxed{1553}rd term in the sequence."},{"question":"A rectangle has a perimeter of 30 units and its dimensions are whole numbers. What is the maximum possible area of the rectangle in square units?","answer":"To determine the maximum possible area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 30 units and whole number dimensions, I start by recalling the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is ( P = 2 times (length + width) ). Given that the perimeter is 30 units, I can set up the equation ( 2 times (l + w) = 30 ), which simplifies to ( l + w = 15 ).Next, I express the area of the rectangle using the formula ( A = l times w ). Since ( w = 15 - l ), I substitute this into the area formula to get ( A = l times (15 - l) ), which simplifies to ( A = 15l - l^2 ).To find the maximum area, I recognize that this is a quadratic equation in terms of ( l ), and its graph is a downward-opening parabola. The maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex occurs at ( l = frac{-b}{2a} ), where ( a = -1 ) and ( b = 15 ). Plugging in these values, I find ( l = frac{-15}{2 times -1} = 7.5 ).However, since the dimensions must be whole numbers, I consider the closest whole numbers to 7.5, which are 7 and 8. Substituting these back into the equation for ( w ), I get ( w = 15 - 7 = 8 ) and ( w = 15 - 8 = 7 ).Finally, I calculate the area for these dimensions: ( A = 7 times 8 = 56 ) square units. Therefore, the maximum possible area of the rectangle is 56 square units."},{"question":"A public official wants to donate 5 new soccer balls per each class in two schools.

The die was rolled twice. The first time, the sum of the numbers on the four \\"vertical\\" (i.e., excluding the bottom and top) faces was 33, and the second time it was 35. What number can be written on the face opposite the face with the number 7? Find all possible options.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a six-sided die. The numbers on the faces are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. The die was rolled twice. The first time, the sum of the numbers on the four vertical faces was 33, and the second time it was 35. I need to figure out what number is opposite the face with 7. Hmm, okay.First, let me visualize a die. A standard die has six faces, and each face is opposite another face. So, each number is opposite one other number. The sum of opposite faces is constant for a die, right? Wait, but in this case, the numbers are 6 through 11, so maybe the opposite faces don't necessarily add up to the same total. Hmm, maybe that's something I need to figure out.When the die is rolled, the four vertical faces are the ones that are neither the top nor the bottom. So, each time the die is rolled, the top and bottom faces are excluded from the sum. Therefore, the sum of the four vertical faces is equal to the total sum of all six faces minus the top and bottom faces.Let me write that down. Let’s denote the numbers on the die as a, b, c, d, e, f, which are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 in some order. The total sum of all faces is 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11. Let me calculate that:6 + 7 = 1313 + 8 = 2121 + 9 = 3030 + 10 = 4040 + 11 = 51So, the total sum is 51. Therefore, the sum of the four vertical faces is 51 minus the sum of the top and bottom faces. So, in the first roll, the sum of the vertical faces was 33. That means the sum of the top and bottom faces was 51 - 33 = 18.Similarly, in the second roll, the sum of the vertical faces was 35. So, the sum of the top and bottom faces was 51 - 35 = 16.So, in the first roll, top + bottom = 18, and in the second roll, top + bottom = 16.Now, the die is rolled twice, so the top and bottom faces could have changed. But the opposite faces remain the same, right? So, the pairs of opposite faces don't change between rolls. So, the numbers opposite each other are fixed.Therefore, the possible pairs of opposite faces must be such that in one roll, their sum is 18, and in another roll, their sum is 16. So, the pairs of opposite faces must include numbers that can add up to both 18 and 16.Wait, but each pair of opposite faces has a fixed sum. So, if in the first roll, the top and bottom sum to 18, that means one of the opposite pairs is 18. Similarly, in the second roll, the top and bottom sum to 16, so another opposite pair is 16. But wait, is that possible? Because each die only has three pairs of opposite faces, each with their own sums.Wait, hold on. Let me think again. Each time the die is rolled, the top and bottom are a pair of opposite faces. So, in the first roll, the top and bottom are one pair, and in the second roll, they are another pair. So, the two different pairs of opposite faces have sums 18 and 16.Therefore, the die must have at least two different pairs of opposite faces with sums 18 and 16. The third pair can have a different sum.So, let me list all possible pairs from the numbers 6,7,8,9,10,11 and see which pairs add up to 16 and 18.First, let's find all possible pairs:6 + 7 = 136 + 8 = 146 + 9 = 156 + 10 = 166 + 11 = 177 + 8 = 157 + 9 = 167 + 10 = 177 + 11 = 188 + 9 = 178 + 10 = 188 + 11 = 199 + 10 = 199 + 11 = 2010 + 11 = 21So, looking for pairs that add up to 16 and 18.Looking for sum 16:6 + 10 = 167 + 9 = 16Sum 18:7 + 11 = 188 + 10 = 18So, the possible pairs for sum 16 are (6,10) and (7,9). For sum 18, the possible pairs are (7,11) and (8,10).So, in the first roll, the top and bottom faces sum to 18, so they must be either (7,11) or (8,10). In the second roll, the top and bottom sum to 16, so they must be either (6,10) or (7,9).But wait, the opposite pairs are fixed. So, if in the first roll, the top and bottom are (7,11), then 7 and 11 are opposite. Then, in the second roll, the top and bottom are (6,10) or (7,9). But if 7 is already opposite 11, then 7 cannot be opposite 9. So, if in the second roll, the top and bottom are (7,9), that would mean 7 is opposite both 11 and 9, which is impossible.Similarly, if in the first roll, the top and bottom are (8,10), then 8 and 10 are opposite. Then, in the second roll, the top and bottom could be (6,10) or (7,9). But if 10 is already opposite 8, then 10 cannot be opposite 6. So, in the second roll, if the top and bottom are (6,10), that would mean 10 is opposite both 8 and 6, which is impossible.Therefore, the only possibility is that in the first roll, the top and bottom are (7,11), and in the second roll, the top and bottom are (6,10). Alternatively, in the first roll, top and bottom are (8,10), and in the second roll, top and bottom are (7,9). Let me check both possibilities.Case 1:First roll: top and bottom are (7,11). So, 7 is opposite 11.Second roll: top and bottom are (6,10). So, 6 is opposite 10.Therefore, the remaining numbers are 8 and 9. So, 8 must be opposite 9.So, the opposite pairs are (7,11), (6,10), and (8,9).Case 2:First roll: top and bottom are (8,10). So, 8 is opposite 10.Second roll: top and bottom are (7,9). So, 7 is opposite 9.Then, the remaining numbers are 6 and 11. So, 6 must be opposite 11.So, the opposite pairs are (8,10), (7,9), and (6,11).So, these are the two possible configurations.Now, the question is: What number can be written on the face opposite the face with the number 7? So, in Case 1, 7 is opposite 11. In Case 2, 7 is opposite 9. So, 7 can be opposite either 9 or 11.Wait, but let me make sure that both configurations are possible.In Case 1:Opposite pairs: (7,11), (6,10), (8,9). So, the vertical faces in the first roll would be 6,8,9,10. Their sum is 6+8+9+10=33, which matches the first roll.In the second roll, the top and bottom are 6 and 10, so the vertical faces are 7,8,9,11. Their sum is 7+8+9+11=35, which matches the second roll.So, Case 1 works.In Case 2:Opposite pairs: (7,9), (8,10), (6,11). So, in the first roll, top and bottom are 8 and 10, so vertical faces are 6,7,9,11. Their sum is 6+7+9+11=33, which matches the first roll.In the second roll, top and bottom are 7 and 9, so vertical faces are 6,8,10,11. Their sum is 6+8+10+11=35, which matches the second roll.So, Case 2 also works.Therefore, both configurations are possible, meaning that 7 can be opposite either 9 or 11.Wait, but the question says \\"What number can be written on the face opposite the face with the number 7? Find all possible options.\\"So, the possible numbers opposite 7 are 9 and 11.But let me double-check if there are any other possibilities.Is there a way for 7 to be opposite 6 or 8?If 7 were opposite 6, then the pair would be (7,6). Their sum is 13. Then, in the first roll, the top and bottom would have to sum to 18, so another pair would have to sum to 18, which could be (8,10) or (7,11). But if 7 is already opposite 6, it can't be opposite 11. So, the other pair would have to be (8,10). Then, the third pair would be (9,11). Their sum is 20.But in the first roll, the vertical faces sum to 33, which is total 51 minus top and bottom 18, so vertical faces sum to 33. So, in this case, if the top and bottom are (8,10), then vertical faces are 6,7,9,11. Their sum is 6+7+9+11=33, which works. Then, in the second roll, the top and bottom would have to sum to 16. So, the possible pairs are (6,10) or (7,9). But 6 is already opposite 7, so (6,10) is not possible because 6 is opposite 7. Similarly, (7,9) would require 7 to be opposite 9, but 7 is already opposite 6, so that's not possible. Therefore, this configuration doesn't work because we can't have the second roll's top and bottom sum to 16.Similarly, if 7 is opposite 8, their sum is 15. Then, the other pairs would have to be (6,11) and (9,10). Their sums are 17 and 19. Then, in the first roll, top and bottom would have to sum to 18, which would require (9,9) or something, but 9 is only once. So, that's not possible. Therefore, 7 cannot be opposite 8.Similarly, if 7 is opposite 10, their sum is 17. Then, the other pairs would have to be (6,11) and (8,9). Their sums are 17 and 17. Then, in the first roll, top and bottom would have to sum to 18, but the only pairs are (6,11) and (8,9), which both sum to 17. So, that's not possible. Therefore, 7 cannot be opposite 10.Similarly, if 7 is opposite 11, which is one of our cases, that works. And if 7 is opposite 9, which is the other case, that also works.Therefore, the only possible numbers opposite 7 are 9 and 11.Wait, but in the second case, 7 is opposite 9, and in the first case, 7 is opposite 11. So, both are possible.Therefore, the possible numbers opposite 7 are 9 and 11.So, the answer is 9 and 11.But let me make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities.Wait, is there a way for 7 to be opposite both 9 and 11? No, because each face is opposite only one face.So, the two possible configurations give us 7 opposite 9 or 11.Therefore, the possible numbers are 9 and 11.**Final Answer**The number opposite the face with 7 can be boxed{9} or boxed{11}."},{"question":"A merchant bought several sacks of salt in Tver and sold them in Moscow with a profit of 100 rubles. With all the money earned, he bought salt in Tver again (at the Tver price) and sold it in Moscow (at the Moscow price). This time the profit was 120 rubles. How much money did he spend on the first purchase?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about a merchant buying and selling salt between Tver and Moscow. Let me try to parse it step by step. First, the merchant buys several sacks of salt in Tver and sells them in Moscow, making a profit of 100 rubles. Then, he takes all the money he earned and buys salt again in Tver, selling it in Moscow, and this time he makes a profit of 120 rubles. The question is asking how much money he spent on the first purchase.Hmm, okay. So, let's break this down. Let me denote some variables to represent the unknowns here. Let me think... Let’s say the cost price of salt in Tver is ( c ) rubles per sack, and the selling price in Moscow is ( s ) rubles per sack. The merchant buys several sacks, so let's denote the number of sacks he bought initially as ( n ). So, his cost for the first purchase is ( n times c ) rubles. Then, he sells them in Moscow for ( n times s ) rubles. The profit he makes is the selling price minus the cost price, which is ( n times s - n times c = n(s - c) ). According to the problem, this profit is 100 rubles. So, we can write the equation:( n(s - c) = 100 )  ...(1)Okay, that's the first part. Now, the merchant takes all the money he earned from the first sale and uses it to buy salt again in Tver. So, the money he earned is the selling price from the first sale, which is ( n times s ). He uses this entire amount to buy salt again in Tver. So, the number of sacks he can buy the second time is ( frac{n times s}{c} ). Because he's spending all the money ( n times s ) at the cost price ( c ) per sack.Then, he sells these sacks in Moscow again, making a profit of 120 rubles. So, the selling price for the second time is ( frac{n times s}{c} times s ). His cost for the second purchase was ( n times s ), so his profit is:( frac{n times s}{c} times s - n times s = n times s times left( frac{s}{c} - 1 right) )And this profit is given as 120 rubles. So, we can write the equation:( n times s times left( frac{s}{c} - 1 right) = 120 )  ...(2)Now, we have two equations:1. ( n(s - c) = 100 )2. ( n s left( frac{s}{c} - 1 right) = 120 )Our goal is to find the amount he spent on the first purchase, which is ( n times c ). Let's denote this amount as ( M ). So, ( M = n c ). So, we need to find ( M ). Let's see how we can manipulate these equations to find ( M ).From equation (1), we can express ( n ) in terms of ( c ) and ( s ):( n = frac{100}{s - c} )  ...(1a)Now, let's substitute this expression for ( n ) into equation (2):( left( frac{100}{s - c} right) times s times left( frac{s}{c} - 1 right) = 120 )Let me simplify this equation step by step.First, let's compute ( frac{s}{c} - 1 ). That can be written as ( frac{s - c}{c} ).So, substituting that in, the equation becomes:( left( frac{100}{s - c} right) times s times left( frac{s - c}{c} right) = 120 )Notice that ( s - c ) in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So, simplifying:( frac{100}{1} times frac{s}{c} = 120 )So, that simplifies to:( 100 times frac{s}{c} = 120 )Divide both sides by 100:( frac{s}{c} = frac{120}{100} = frac{6}{5} )So, ( frac{s}{c} = frac{6}{5} ), which means ( s = frac{6}{5}c ).Okay, so the selling price in Moscow is ( frac{6}{5} ) times the cost price in Tver.Now, let's go back to equation (1a):( n = frac{100}{s - c} )But since ( s = frac{6}{5}c ), let's substitute that in:( n = frac{100}{frac{6}{5}c - c} = frac{100}{frac{6}{5}c - frac{5}{5}c} = frac{100}{frac{1}{5}c} = 100 times frac{5}{c} = frac{500}{c} )So, ( n = frac{500}{c} ).But we know that ( M = n c ), so substituting ( n ):( M = frac{500}{c} times c = 500 )Wait, so ( M = 500 ) rubles? That seems straightforward. Let me verify that.So, if the merchant spent 500 rubles on the first purchase, and the cost per sack is ( c ), then he bought ( n = frac{500}{c} ) sacks. He sold each sack for ( s = frac{6}{5}c ), so the total selling price was ( n times s = frac{500}{c} times frac{6}{5}c = 500 times frac{6}{5} = 600 ) rubles. So, his profit was 600 - 500 = 100 rubles, which matches the first condition.Then, he took all 600 rubles and bought salt again in Tver. The number of sacks he could buy is ( frac{600}{c} ). He sold each sack for ( s = frac{6}{5}c ), so total selling price was ( frac{600}{c} times frac{6}{5}c = 600 times frac{6}{5} = 720 ) rubles.His cost for the second purchase was 600 rubles, so his profit was 720 - 600 = 120 rubles, which matches the second condition.Therefore, the amount he spent on the first purchase was 500 rubles.Wait, let me just think again if I missed anything. So, the key was to express everything in terms of ( c ) and ( s ), find the ratio between ( s ) and ( c ), then substitute back to find ( n ), and then compute ( M = n c ). It seems consistent.Alternatively, another approach could be to let ( M ) be the amount spent on the first purchase, so ( M = n c ). Then, the selling price is ( n s ), so the profit is ( n s - M = 100 ). Therefore, ( n s = M + 100 ).Then, in the second transaction, he uses all the money earned, which is ( M + 100 ), to buy salt again. So, the number of sacks he buys the second time is ( frac{M + 100}{c} ). Then, he sells them in Moscow, so the selling price is ( frac{M + 100}{c} times s ). The profit is then ( frac{M + 100}{c} times s - (M + 100) = 120 ).So, we have two equations:1. ( n s - M = 100 )2. ( frac{(M + 100)}{c} times s - (M + 100) = 120 )But since ( M = n c ), we can substitute ( n = frac{M}{c} ) into the first equation:( frac{M}{c} times s - M = 100 )Which simplifies to:( M times left( frac{s}{c} - 1 right) = 100 ) ...(A)Similarly, the second equation is:( (M + 100) times left( frac{s}{c} - 1 right) = 120 ) ...(B)So, now we have:From equation (A): ( M times k = 100 ), where ( k = frac{s}{c} - 1 )From equation (B): ( (M + 100) times k = 120 )So, let me denote ( k = frac{s}{c} - 1 ). Then, equation (A) is ( M k = 100 ) and equation (B) is ( (M + 100)k = 120 ).We can solve for ( k ) from equation (A): ( k = frac{100}{M} )Substitute into equation (B):( (M + 100) times frac{100}{M} = 120 )Multiply both sides by ( M ):( (M + 100) times 100 = 120 M )Expand the left side:( 100 M + 10000 = 120 M )Subtract ( 100 M ) from both sides:( 10000 = 20 M )Divide both sides by 20:( M = 500 )So, that's another way to get the same result, which is 500 rubles. So, this confirms the earlier answer.Therefore, the merchant spent 500 rubles on the first purchase.**Final Answer**The merchant spent boxed{500} rubles on the first purchase."},{"question":"Zhenya had 9 cards with numbers from 1 to 9. He lost the card with the number 7. Is it possible to arrange the remaining 8 cards in a row so that any two adjacent cards form a number divisible by 7?","answer":"Alright, so Zhenya had 9 cards numbered from 1 to 9, but he lost the card with the number 7. Now, he wants to arrange the remaining 8 cards in a row such that any two adjacent cards form a number divisible by 7. Hmm, that sounds tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step.First, let me list out the remaining cards: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. So, we have 8 cards left. The goal is to arrange them in a sequence where each pair of adjacent cards forms a two-digit number divisible by 7. Okay, so I need to think about which two-digit numbers formed by these cards are divisible by 7. Let me list all possible two-digit numbers from these cards and check their divisibility by 7.Starting with 1:- 12: 12 ÷ 7 ≈ 1.714, not divisible.- 13: 13 ÷ 7 ≈ 1.857, not divisible.- 14: 14 ÷ 7 = 2, yes, divisible.- 15: 15 ÷ 7 ≈ 2.142, no.- 16: 16 ÷ 7 ≈ 2.285, no.- 18: 18 ÷ 7 ≈ 2.571, no.- 19: 19 ÷ 7 ≈ 2.714, no.So, from 1, only 14 is divisible by 7.Next, starting with 2:- 21: 21 ÷ 7 = 3, yes.- 23: 23 ÷ 7 ≈ 3.285, no.- 24: 24 ÷ 7 ≈ 3.428, no.- 25: 25 ÷ 7 ≈ 3.571, no.- 26: 26 ÷ 7 ≈ 3.714, no.- 28: 28 ÷ 7 = 4, yes.- 29: 29 ÷ 7 ≈ 4.142, no.So, from 2, we have 21 and 28.Starting with 3:- 31: 31 ÷ 7 ≈ 4.428, no.- 32: 32 ÷ 7 ≈ 4.571, no.- 34: 34 ÷ 7 ≈ 4.857, no.- 35: 35 ÷ 7 = 5, yes.- 36: 36 ÷ 7 ≈ 5.142, no.- 38: 38 ÷ 7 ≈ 5.428, no.- 39: 39 ÷ 7 ≈ 5.571, no.From 3, only 35 is divisible by 7.Starting with 4:- 41: 41 ÷ 7 ≈ 5.857, no.- 42: 42 ÷ 7 = 6, yes.- 43: 43 ÷ 7 ≈ 6.142, no.- 45: 45 ÷ 7 ≈ 6.428, no.- 46: 46 ÷ 7 ≈ 6.571, no.- 48: 48 ÷ 7 ≈ 6.857, no.- 49: 49 ÷ 7 = 7, yes.So, from 4, we have 42 and 49.Starting with 5:- 51: 51 ÷ 7 ≈ 7.285, no.- 52: 52 ÷ 7 ≈ 7.428, no.- 53: 53 ÷ 7 ≈ 7.571, no.- 54: 54 ÷ 7 ≈ 7.714, no.- 56: 56 ÷ 7 = 8, yes.- 58: 58 ÷ 7 ≈ 8.285, no.- 59: 59 ÷ 7 ≈ 8.428, no.From 5, only 56 is divisible by 7.Starting with 6:- 61: 61 ÷ 7 ≈ 8.714, no.- 62: 62 ÷ 7 ≈ 8.857, no.- 63: 63 ÷ 7 = 9, yes.- 64: 64 ÷ 7 ≈ 9.142, no.- 65: 65 ÷ 7 ≈ 9.285, no.- 68: 68 ÷ 7 ≈ 9.714, no.- 69: 69 ÷ 7 ≈ 9.857, no.From 6, only 63 is divisible by 7.Starting with 8:- 81: 81 ÷ 7 ≈ 11.571, no.- 82: 82 ÷ 7 ≈ 11.714, no.- 83: 83 ÷ 7 ≈ 11.857, no.- 84: 84 ÷ 7 = 12, yes.- 85: 85 ÷ 7 ≈ 12.142, no.- 86: 86 ÷ 7 ≈ 12.285, no.- 89: 89 ÷ 7 ≈ 12.714, no.From 8, only 84 is divisible by 7.Starting with 9:- 91: 91 ÷ 7 = 13, yes.- 92: 92 ÷ 7 ≈ 13.142, no.- 93: 93 ÷ 7 ≈ 13.285, no.- 94: 94 ÷ 7 ≈ 13.428, no.- 95: 95 ÷ 7 ≈ 13.571, no.- 96: 96 ÷ 7 ≈ 13.714, no.- 98: 98 ÷ 7 = 14, yes.From 9, we have 91 and 98.Alright, so compiling all the possible two-digit numbers divisible by 7:- 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 84, 91, 98.Now, let me list these as transitions between digits:- 1 -> 4 (14)- 2 -> 1 (21), 2 -> 8 (28)- 3 -> 5 (35)- 4 -> 2 (42), 4 -> 9 (49)- 5 -> 6 (56)- 6 -> 3 (63)- 8 -> 4 (84)- 9 -> 1 (91), 9 -> 8 (98)So, now I can model this as a graph where each node is a digit, and edges represent possible transitions where the two-digit number is divisible by 7.Let me represent this:- 1: [4]- 2: [1, 8]- 3: [5]- 4: [2, 9]- 5: [6]- 6: [3]- 8: [4]- 9: [1, 8]So, now the problem reduces to finding a path that uses each node exactly once (since each card is used once) and follows these edges. This is essentially finding a Hamiltonian path in this graph.Let me try to visualize the graph:- 1 is connected only to 4.- 2 is connected to 1 and 8.- 3 is connected only to 5.- 4 is connected to 2 and 9.- 5 is connected only to 6.- 6 is connected only to 3.- 8 is connected only to 4.- 9 is connected to 1 and 8.Looking at this, I can see that some nodes have only one connection, which might be starting or ending points.Looking at the degrees:- 1: degree 1 (connected to 4)- 2: degree 2 (connected to 1 and 8)- 3: degree 1 (connected to 5)- 4: degree 2 (connected to 2 and 9)- 5: degree 1 (connected to 6)- 6: degree 1 (connected to 3)- 8: degree 1 (connected to 4)- 9: degree 2 (connected to 1 and 8)So, nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 8 have degree 1, which are potential start or end points. Nodes 2, 4, 9 have degree 2.In a Hamiltonian path, we can have at most two nodes with degree 1 (the start and end), but here we have five nodes with degree 1. That suggests that a Hamiltonian path might not be possible because we can't have five endpoints in a single path.Wait, but actually, in a graph, the number of nodes with odd degrees must be even for an Eulerian trail, but here we're talking about a Hamiltonian path, which is different. Hmm, maybe my initial thought isn't directly applicable.Alternatively, perhaps I can try to construct such a path manually, starting from one of the degree 1 nodes.Let me try starting from 3, since it's connected only to 5.So, starting at 3, next must be 5. Then, from 5, only connected to 6. From 6, only connected to 3, but we've already used 3. So, that's a dead end. So, starting at 3 doesn't seem to work.Alternatively, starting at 5: 5 -> 6 -> 3. Then, stuck again.Starting at 6: 6 -> 3 -> 5. Then, stuck.Starting at 8: 8 -> 4. From 4, can go to 2 or 9.Let me try 8 -> 4 -> 2. From 2, can go to 1 or 8. 8 is already used, so go to 1. From 1, only connected to 4, which is already used. So, stuck. So, path: 8-4-2-1. Then, remaining digits: 3,5,6,9. Hmm, not connected.Alternatively, from 4, go to 9 instead of 2. So, 8 ->4 ->9. From 9, can go to 1 or 8. 8 is used, so go to 1. From 1, only connected to 4, which is used. So, stuck again. Path: 8-4-9-1. Remaining digits: 2,3,5,6.Alternatively, maybe starting at 1: 1 ->4. From 4, go to 2 or 9.Let's try 1 ->4 ->2. From 2, go to 8 or 1. 1 is used, so go to 8. From 8, only connected to 4, which is used. So, stuck. Path: 1-4-2-8. Remaining digits:3,5,6,9.Alternatively, from 4, go to 9 instead: 1 ->4 ->9. From 9, go to 8 or 1. 1 is used, so go to 8. From 8, only connected to 4, which is used. So, stuck. Path:1-4-9-8. Remaining digits:2,3,5,6.Hmm, seems like starting from 1 or 8 leads to similar issues.What about starting from 9? 9 can go to 1 or 8.Let me try 9 ->1. From 1, only 4. So, 9-1-4. From 4, go to 2 or 9. 9 is used, so go to 2. From 2, go to 8 or 1. 1 is used, so go to 8. From 8, only 4, which is used. So, stuck. Path:9-1-4-2-8. Remaining digits:3,5,6.Alternatively, from 4, go to 9 again? But 9 is already used.Alternatively, starting from 9 ->8. 9-8-4. From 4, go to 2 or 9. 9 is used, so go to 2. From 2, go to 1 or 8. 8 is used, so go to 1. From 1, only 4, which is used. So, stuck. Path:9-8-4-2-1. Remaining digits:3,5,6.Same problem.What about starting from 2? 2 can go to 1 or 8.Let's try 2 ->1. From 1, only 4. So, 2-1-4. From 4, go to 9 or 2. 2 is used, so go to 9. From 9, go to 8 or 1. 1 is used, so go to 8. From 8, only 4, which is used. So, stuck. Path:2-1-4-9-8. Remaining digits:3,5,6.Alternatively, from 2, go to 8: 2-8-4. From 4, go to 9 or 2. 2 is used, so go to 9. From 9, go to 1 or 8. 8 is used, so go to 1. From 1, only 4, which is used. So, stuck. Path:2-8-4-9-1. Remaining digits:3,5,6.Same issue.What about starting from 3? 3-5-6. From 6, only 3, which is used. So, stuck. Path:3-5-6. Remaining digits:1,2,4,8,9.Alternatively, starting from 5: 5-6-3. Then stuck.Starting from 6:6-3-5. Then stuck.Hmm, seems like the 3-5-6 chain is isolated from the rest. So, unless we can connect them somehow, it's impossible.Wait, let me check if there are any connections between these two groups.Looking back at the graph:- The main group: 1,2,4,8,9- The other group:3,5,6Is there any way to connect these two groups? Let's see.From 3, only connected to 5.From 5, only connected to 6.From 6, only connected to 3.So, no connections to the main group.Similarly, in the main group, is there any connection to 3,5,6? Let's see:Looking at the edges:- 1: only 4- 2: 1,8- 4: 2,9- 8:4- 9:1,8No connections to 3,5,6.Therefore, the graph is split into two disconnected components: one with 1,2,4,8,9 and another with 3,5,6.Since we have two separate components, it's impossible to have a single path that includes all 8 nodes because you can't move from one component to the other.Therefore, it's impossible to arrange the remaining 8 cards in such a way that every two adjacent cards form a number divisible by 7.Wait, but hold on. Maybe I missed some transitions? Let me double-check.Looking back at the two-digit numbers:- 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 84, 91, 98.Is there any way to connect the two groups? For example, is there a transition from the main group to 3,5,6 or vice versa?Looking at the numbers:- 35 is 3->5- 56 is 5->6- 63 is 6->3But none of these connect to the main group.Similarly, in the main group:- 14 is 1->4- 21 is 2->1- 28 is 2->8- 42 is 4->2- 49 is 4->9- 84 is 8->4- 91 is 9->1- 98 is 9->8No connections to 3,5,6.Therefore, the two groups are indeed disconnected.Hence, it's impossible to arrange all 8 cards in a single sequence meeting the given condition.**Final Answer**boxed{No}"},{"question":"The inequality ( x^2 < n ) has exactly ( n ) integer solutions. Find ( n ). If there are several possible answers, list them in ascending order separated by commas or semicolons.","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality ( x^2 < n ) and it's supposed to have exactly ( n ) integer solutions. Hmm, interesting. I need to find the value(s) of ( n ) that satisfy this condition. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let me understand what the inequality ( x^2 < n ) means. It's saying that the square of some integer ( x ) is less than ( n ). So, I need to find all integers ( x ) such that when I square them, the result is less than ( n ). The number of such integers should be exactly ( n ).Let me consider the integer solutions for ( x ). Since ( x^2 ) is always non-negative, ( x ) can be both positive and negative, as well as zero. So, the solutions will be symmetric around zero.For example, if ( n = 1 ), then ( x^2 < 1 ) implies ( x = 0 ) is the only solution. So, only 1 integer solution. But ( n = 1 ) here, so 1 solution. That works. Wait, does it? Because the problem says exactly ( n ) integer solutions. So, if ( n = 1 ), we have 1 solution, which is correct. Hmm, so maybe ( n = 1 ) is a solution.Wait, let me check ( n = 2 ). Then ( x^2 < 2 ). The integer solutions are ( x = -1, 0, 1 ). So, that's 3 solutions. But ( n = 2 ), so 3 solutions ≠ 2. So, that doesn't work.What about ( n = 3 )? Then ( x^2 < 3 ). The integer solutions are ( x = -1, 0, 1 ). Again, 3 solutions. So, ( n = 3 ) would have 3 solutions, which matches. So, ( n = 3 ) is another solution.Wait, hold on. Let me check ( n = 4 ). Then ( x^2 < 4 ). The solutions are ( x = -1, 0, 1 ). Wait, no, actually, ( x = -1, 0, 1 ) because ( (-2)^2 = 4 ) which is not less than 4. So, only 3 solutions again. But ( n = 4 ), so 3 ≠ 4. Doesn't work.Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. If ( n = 4 ), then ( x^2 < 4 ). So, ( x ) can be -1, 0, 1, right? Because ( (-2)^2 = 4 ) is not less than 4. So, only three solutions. So, 3 ≠ 4. So, no.Wait, let me try ( n = 5 ). Then ( x^2 < 5 ). So, ( x ) can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. That's 5 solutions. So, ( n = 5 ) gives 5 solutions. So, that works.Wait, so ( n = 1 ), 3, 5? Hmm, let me check ( n = 6 ). ( x^2 < 6 ). So, ( x ) can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. That's 5 solutions. But ( n = 6 ), so 5 ≠ 6. Doesn't work.Wait, ( n = 7 ). ( x^2 < 7 ). So, ( x ) can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. Still 5 solutions. So, 5 ≠ 7. Doesn't work.What about ( n = 9 ). ( x^2 < 9 ). So, ( x ) can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. Wait, no. Wait, ( (-3)^2 = 9 ), which is not less than 9. So, ( x ) can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. That's 5 solutions. But ( n = 9 ), so 5 ≠ 9. Doesn't work.Wait, maybe I need to think about how the number of solutions increases as ( n ) increases.Let me formalize this. The inequality ( x^2 < n ) implies that ( x ) is in the interval ( (-sqrt{n}, sqrt{n}) ). Since ( x ) is an integer, the number of integer solutions is the number of integers in this interval.The number of integers between ( -sqrt{n} ) and ( sqrt{n} ) is ( 2 times lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor + 1 ). Because for each positive integer less than ( sqrt{n} ), there is a corresponding negative integer, and then zero. So, total solutions = ( 2k + 1 ), where ( k = lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ).So, according to the problem, ( 2k + 1 = n ). So, ( n = 2k + 1 ). But ( k = lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ). So, we have ( n = 2 lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor + 1 ).So, let me denote ( k = lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ). Then, ( n = 2k + 1 ). Also, since ( k leq sqrt{n} < k + 1 ), squaring all parts, ( k^2 leq n < (k + 1)^2 ).But ( n = 2k + 1 ), so substituting, ( k^2 leq 2k + 1 < (k + 1)^2 ).So, let's solve these inequalities for ( k ).First inequality: ( k^2 leq 2k + 1 ).Bring all terms to left: ( k^2 - 2k - 1 leq 0 ).This is a quadratic in ( k ). Let's find its roots.Discriminant: ( 4 + 4 = 8 ). So, roots at ( k = [2 ± sqrt{8}]/2 = 1 ± sqrt{2} ).Approximately, ( sqrt{2} approx 1.414 ), so roots are at approximately 2.414 and -0.414.Since ( k ) is a non-negative integer (as it's the floor of sqrt(n)), the inequality ( k^2 - 2k - 1 leq 0 ) holds for ( k leq 2.414 ). So, ( k leq 2 ).Second inequality: ( 2k + 1 < (k + 1)^2 ).Expand the right side: ( k^2 + 2k + 1 ).So, inequality becomes ( 2k + 1 < k^2 + 2k + 1 ).Subtract ( 2k + 1 ) from both sides: ( 0 < k^2 ).Which is true for all ( k neq 0 ). Since ( k ) is a non-negative integer, ( k geq 0 ). So, for ( k geq 1 ), the inequality holds.So, combining both inequalities, we have ( k leq 2 ) and ( k geq 1 ). So, ( k = 1 ) or ( k = 2 ).Let me check for ( k = 1 ):Then, ( n = 2(1) + 1 = 3 ).Check if ( k = lfloor sqrt{3} rfloor = 1 ). Yes, because ( sqrt{3} approx 1.732 ), so floor is 1. So, that works.For ( k = 2 ):( n = 2(2) + 1 = 5 ).Check ( lfloor sqrt{5} rfloor = 2 ). Since ( sqrt{5} approx 2.236 ), floor is 2. So, that works too.Wait, so ( k = 1 ) gives ( n = 3 ) and ( k = 2 ) gives ( n = 5 ). Are there any other possible ( k )?Wait, earlier we saw that ( k leq 2 ). So, ( k = 0 ) is also possible, but let's check.For ( k = 0 ):( n = 2(0) + 1 = 1 ).Check ( lfloor sqrt{1} rfloor = 1 ). Wait, no. ( sqrt{1} = 1 ), so floor is 1, not 0. So, that doesn't satisfy ( k = lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ). So, ( k = 0 ) is invalid here.So, only ( k = 1 ) and ( k = 2 ), giving ( n = 3 ) and ( n = 5 ).Wait, but earlier when I tried ( n = 1 ), I thought it worked because ( x = 0 ) is the only solution, which is 1 solution, and ( n = 1 ). So, why isn't ( n = 1 ) a solution?Wait, let me check with the formula. If ( n = 1 ), then ( k = lfloor sqrt{1} rfloor = 1 ). Then, ( n = 2k + 1 = 3 ). But ( n = 1 ) ≠ 3. So, that doesn't satisfy the equation ( n = 2k + 1 ). So, even though ( n = 1 ) has 1 solution, it doesn't fit into the formula because ( k = 1 ) gives ( n = 3 ).So, is ( n = 1 ) a solution? Let me think again.The problem says the inequality ( x^2 < n ) has exactly ( n ) integer solutions. So, for ( n = 1 ), the inequality ( x^2 < 1 ) has exactly 1 integer solution, which is ( x = 0 ). So, that works. So, why doesn't it fit into the formula?Because when ( n = 1 ), ( k = lfloor sqrt{1} rfloor = 1 ), but ( n = 2k + 1 = 3 ). So, that suggests that ( n = 1 ) is a special case where the formula doesn't hold because ( k ) is 1, but ( n = 1 ) is less than ( 2k + 1 ).So, maybe ( n = 1 ) is another solution outside of the formula.Wait, let me think. So, if ( n = 1 ), the number of solutions is 1, which is equal to ( n ). So, that's a valid solution.Similarly, when ( n = 3 ), the number of solutions is 3, which is equal to ( n ). So, that's another solution.When ( n = 5 ), the number of solutions is 5, which is equal to ( n ). So, that's another solution.Wait, but when ( n = 2 ), the number of solutions is 3, which is not equal to ( n = 2 ). Similarly, ( n = 4 ) has 3 solutions, which is not equal to 4.So, perhaps ( n = 1, 3, 5 ) are the solutions.Wait, let me check ( n = 5 ). So, ( x^2 < 5 ). The integer solutions are ( x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ). That's 5 solutions. So, yes, that works.What about ( n = 7 )? ( x^2 < 7 ). Solutions are ( x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ). That's 5 solutions, which is less than 7. So, doesn't work.Similarly, ( n = 9 ). ( x^2 < 9 ). Solutions are ( x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ). Wait, no, actually, ( x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ) is 5 solutions, but ( x = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ) would be 7 solutions, but ( (-3)^2 = 9 ), which is not less than 9. So, only up to 2. So, 5 solutions. So, 5 ≠ 9.Wait, so maybe ( n = 1, 3, 5 ) are the only solutions.Wait, let me check ( n = 0 ). Wait, ( n ) is a positive integer? Or can it be zero?The problem doesn't specify, but if ( n = 0 ), then ( x^2 < 0 ) has no solutions, which is 0 solutions. So, 0 solutions = ( n = 0 ). So, that would be another solution. But I'm not sure if ( n ) is supposed to be positive.Wait, the problem says \\"the inequality ( x^2 < n ) has exactly ( n ) integer solutions.\\" So, if ( n = 0 ), then the inequality ( x^2 < 0 ) has 0 solutions, which is equal to ( n = 0 ). So, that works.But in the earlier analysis, when I considered ( k = lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ), for ( n = 0 ), ( k = 0 ), and ( n = 2k + 1 = 1 ). So, that doesn't fit. So, ( n = 0 ) is another special case.But the problem might be expecting positive integers for ( n ). It's not clear. The original problem didn't specify, but in the context of integer solutions, ( n ) is likely a positive integer.So, perhaps ( n = 1, 3, 5 ) are the solutions.Wait, let me check ( n = 1 ): 1 solution.( n = 3 ): 3 solutions.( n = 5 ): 5 solutions.Wait, let me check ( n = 7 ). As before, ( x^2 < 7 ) gives 5 solutions, which is less than 7. So, no.Wait, what about ( n = 15 )? Let me check. ( x^2 < 15 ). So, ( x ) can be from -3 to 3, because 4^2 = 16 which is greater than 15. So, ( x = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ). That's 7 solutions. So, 7 ≠ 15. Doesn't work.Wait, so maybe only ( n = 1, 3, 5 ) are the solutions.Wait, let me think about ( n = 2 ). The number of solutions is 3, which is more than 2. So, doesn't work.Similarly, ( n = 4 ): 3 solutions, less than 4.( n = 6 ): 5 solutions, less than 6.( n = 7 ): 5 solutions, less than 7.( n = 8 ): 5 solutions, less than 8.( n = 9 ): 5 solutions, less than 9.( n = 10 ): 5 solutions, less than 10.Wait, so it seems that after ( n = 5 ), the number of solutions doesn't increase until ( n ) reaches the next square.Wait, let me think about when the number of solutions increases.The number of solutions is ( 2k + 1 ), where ( k = lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ). So, as ( n ) increases, ( k ) remains constant until ( n ) reaches the next perfect square.So, for ( k = 1 ), ( n ) ranges from ( 1^2 = 1 ) up to ( (1 + 1)^2 - 1 = 3 ). So, ( n = 1, 2, 3 ). For these ( n ), the number of solutions is ( 2(1) + 1 = 3 ).Wait, but earlier, for ( n = 1 ), the number of solutions was 1, not 3. So, maybe my formula isn't accurate for ( n ) less than ( (k + 1)^2 ).Wait, let me correct that. The number of solutions is ( 2k + 1 ), where ( k = lfloor sqrt{n - 1} rfloor ). Wait, no, that might not be right.Wait, let me think again. For ( x^2 < n ), the integer solutions are all integers ( x ) such that ( |x| < sqrt{n} ). So, ( x ) can be from ( -lfloor sqrt{n} - 1 rfloor ) to ( lfloor sqrt{n} - 1 rfloor ). Wait, no.Wait, actually, ( x ) must satisfy ( -sqrt{n} < x < sqrt{n} ). So, the integer solutions are all integers ( x ) where ( x ) is greater than ( -sqrt{n} ) and less than ( sqrt{n} ).So, the number of integer solutions is ( lfloor sqrt{n} - 1 rfloor + lfloor sqrt{n} - 1 rfloor + 1 ). Wait, that might not be the right way.Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of integers less than ( sqrt{n} ) in absolute value.So, the number of positive integers ( x ) such that ( x < sqrt{n} ) is ( lfloor sqrt{n} - 1 rfloor ). Similarly, the number of negative integers is the same, and then zero. So, total solutions = ( 2 times lfloor sqrt{n} - 1 rfloor + 1 ).Wait, let me test this with ( n = 1 ). Then, ( sqrt{1} = 1 ). So, ( lfloor 1 - 1 rfloor = 0 ). So, total solutions = ( 2 times 0 + 1 = 1 ). Correct.For ( n = 2 ), ( sqrt{2} approx 1.414 ). So, ( lfloor 1.414 - 1 rfloor = 0 ). So, total solutions = ( 2 times 0 + 1 = 1 ). Wait, but earlier, for ( n = 2 ), the solutions were ( -1, 0, 1 ), which is 3 solutions. So, that formula is incorrect.Wait, maybe I need a different approach.Let me consider that for ( x^2 < n ), the integer solutions are all integers ( x ) such that ( x ) is in the interval ( (-sqrt{n}, sqrt{n}) ). So, the number of integers in this interval is ( lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor times 2 + 1 ), but only if ( sqrt{n} ) is not an integer. If ( sqrt{n} ) is an integer, then the number of solutions is ( 2 times (sqrt{n} - 1) + 1 = 2sqrt{n} - 1 ).Wait, let me test this.For ( n = 1 ), ( sqrt{1} = 1 ). So, it's an integer. So, number of solutions is ( 2 times 1 - 1 = 1 ). Correct.For ( n = 2 ), ( sqrt{2} approx 1.414 ). Not integer. So, number of solutions is ( 2 times 1 + 1 = 3 ). Correct.For ( n = 3 ), ( sqrt{3} approx 1.732 ). Not integer. So, number of solutions is ( 2 times 1 + 1 = 3 ). Wait, but earlier, for ( n = 3 ), the number of solutions is 3, which is correct.Wait, but when ( n = 4 ), ( sqrt{4} = 2 ). So, it's an integer. So, number of solutions is ( 2 times 2 - 1 = 3 ). Correct, because ( x = -1, 0, 1 ).Wait, so the formula is:If ( sqrt{n} ) is integer, then number of solutions is ( 2sqrt{n} - 1 ).If ( sqrt{n} ) is not integer, then number of solutions is ( 2 lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor + 1 ).So, in general, the number of solutions is ( 2 lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor + 1 ) if ( n ) is not a perfect square, and ( 2sqrt{n} - 1 ) if ( n ) is a perfect square.Wait, but in the case of ( n = 1 ), which is a perfect square, the number of solutions is ( 2 times 1 - 1 = 1 ), which is correct.Similarly, for ( n = 4 ), it's ( 2 times 2 - 1 = 3 ), which is correct.So, now, the problem states that the number of solutions is exactly ( n ). So, we have two cases:Case 1: ( n ) is a perfect square.Then, number of solutions is ( 2sqrt{n} - 1 = n ).So, ( 2sqrt{n} - 1 = n ).Let me solve this equation.Let ( sqrt{n} = k ), where ( k ) is a positive integer.So, equation becomes ( 2k - 1 = k^2 ).Rearranged: ( k^2 - 2k + 1 = 0 ).Which factors as ( (k - 1)^2 = 0 ).So, ( k = 1 ). Therefore, ( n = k^2 = 1 ).So, ( n = 1 ) is a solution in this case.Case 2: ( n ) is not a perfect square.Then, number of solutions is ( 2 lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor + 1 = n ).Let ( k = lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ). So, ( k leq sqrt{n} < k + 1 ).So, ( n = 2k + 1 ).But since ( k leq sqrt{n} < k + 1 ), substituting ( n = 2k + 1 ), we get:( k leq sqrt{2k + 1} < k + 1 ).Let me square all parts:First inequality: ( k^2 leq 2k + 1 ).Second inequality: ( 2k + 1 < (k + 1)^2 ).Let's solve the first inequality: ( k^2 - 2k - 1 leq 0 ).As before, roots are ( k = 1 pm sqrt{2} ). So, approximately, ( k leq 2.414 ). Since ( k ) is a positive integer, ( k leq 2 ).Second inequality: ( 2k + 1 < k^2 + 2k + 1 ).Simplify: ( 0 < k^2 ). Which is true for all ( k geq 1 ).So, combining both, ( k leq 2 ) and ( k geq 1 ). So, ( k = 1 ) or ( k = 2 ).For ( k = 1 ):( n = 2(1) + 1 = 3 ).Check ( lfloor sqrt{3} rfloor = 1 ). Correct.For ( k = 2 ):( n = 2(2) + 1 = 5 ).Check ( lfloor sqrt{5} rfloor = 2 ). Correct.So, in this case, ( n = 3 ) and ( n = 5 ) are solutions.So, combining both cases, the solutions are ( n = 1, 3, 5 ).Wait, let me verify each of these:For ( n = 1 ):Solutions: ( x = 0 ). So, 1 solution. Correct.For ( n = 3 ):Solutions: ( x = -1, 0, 1 ). So, 3 solutions. Correct.For ( n = 5 ):Solutions: ( x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ). So, 5 solutions. Correct.So, these are all valid.Wait, but earlier I thought ( n = 1 ) was a special case, but it actually fits into the first case where ( n ) is a perfect square. So, that's consistent.So, the possible values of ( n ) are 1, 3, and 5.Wait, let me check ( n = 7 ) again. If ( n = 7 ), which is not a perfect square, then ( lfloor sqrt{7} rfloor = 2 ). So, number of solutions should be ( 2 times 2 + 1 = 5 ). Which is correct. But ( n = 7 ) is not equal to 5, so it's not a solution.Similarly, ( n = 2 ): not a perfect square, ( lfloor sqrt{2} rfloor = 1 ), so solutions = 3, which is not equal to 2.So, yes, only ( n = 1, 3, 5 ) satisfy the condition.Therefore, the possible values of ( n ) are 1, 3, and 5.**Final Answer**The possible values of ( n ) are boxed{1}, boxed{3}, and boxed{5}."},{"question":"The largest number by which the expression n^3 - n is divisible for all possible integral values of n, is:textbf{(A)} 2 qquadtextbf{(B)} 3 qquadtextbf{(C)} 4 qquadtextbf{(D)} 5 qquadtextbf{(E)} 6","answer":"To find the largest number by which ( n^3 - n ) is divisible for all integer values of ( n ), I'll start by factoring the expression.First, factor out an ( n ) from each term:[n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1)]Next, recognize that ( n^2 - 1 ) is a difference of squares, so it can be factored further:[n(n^2 - 1) = n(n - 1)(n + 1)]Now, the expression is written as the product of three consecutive integers: ( n - 1 ), ( n ), and ( n + 1 ).Since these are three consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 2 and another must be divisible by 3. Therefore, the product is divisible by ( 2 times 3 = 6 ).To confirm that 6 is the largest such number, consider specific values of ( n ):- If ( n = 2 ), then ( n^3 - n = 8 - 2 = 6 ), which is divisible by 6.- If ( n = 3 ), then ( n^3 - n = 27 - 3 = 24 ), which is also divisible by 6.Testing divisibility by numbers larger than 6 (like 12) shows that it doesn't hold for all ( n ).

Each stadium must have at least one student, and each student can only go to one stadium. The total number of different allocation methods is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about four students volunteering at three stadiums after the 2023 Hangzhou Asian Games. The conditions are that each stadium must have at least one student, and each student can only go to one stadium. I need to figure out the total number of different allocation methods. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with allocations where each item (in this case, students) can go to different places (stadiums), it's a problem of counting the number of functions from one set to another. Specifically, each student can be assigned to any of the three stadiums, so without any restrictions, the total number of ways would be 3^4, since each of the four students has three choices. Let me calculate that: 3^4 is 81. So, there are 81 possible ways if there are no restrictions.But wait, the problem says that each stadium must have at least one student. That means we can't have any stadium left empty. So, we need to subtract the cases where one or more stadiums are empty. This sounds like a classic inclusion-exclusion problem.Inclusion-exclusion principle is used to calculate the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by including and excluding the intersections appropriately. In this context, we can use it to subtract the cases where at least one stadium is empty.Let me recall the formula for the number of onto functions from a set A to a set B. The number of onto functions is given by:[sum_{k=0}^{|B|} (-1)^k binom{|B|}{k} (|B| - k)^{|A|}]In this problem, |A| is 4 (students) and |B| is 3 (stadiums). So plugging in the numbers, we get:[sum_{k=0}^{3} (-1)^k binom{3}{k} (3 - k)^4]Let me compute each term step by step.For k = 0:[(-1)^0 binom{3}{0} (3 - 0)^4 = 1 * 1 * 81 = 81]For k = 1:[(-1)^1 binom{3}{1} (3 - 1)^4 = -1 * 3 * 16 = -48]For k = 2:[(-1)^2 binom{3}{2} (3 - 2)^4 = 1 * 3 * 1 = 3]For k = 3:[(-1)^3 binom{3}{3} (3 - 3)^4 = -1 * 1 * 0 = 0]Now, adding these up: 81 - 48 + 3 + 0 = 36.So, according to this, the number of onto functions is 36. That should be the number of ways to allocate the four students to three stadiums with each stadium having at least one student.But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using Stirling numbers of the second kind? I remember that Stirling numbers count the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets. The formula is S(n, k), and then we multiply by k! to account for the different orderings since the stadiums are distinct.So, for our problem, n = 4 and k = 3. Let me recall the formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind:[S(n, k) = S(n - 1, k - 1) + k * S(n - 1, k)]With the base cases: S(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0, S(0, 0) = 1, and S(n, k) = 0 for k > n.So, let's compute S(4, 3):First, I need S(3, 2) and S(3, 3).Compute S(3, 2):Using the same formula, S(3, 2) = S(2, 1) + 2 * S(2, 2).Compute S(2, 1) = 1 (since there's only one way to put two objects into one subset).Compute S(2, 2) = 1 (only one way to put each object into its own subset).So, S(3, 2) = 1 + 2 * 1 = 3.Now, compute S(3, 3) = 1 (only one way to put each object into its own subset).So, S(4, 3) = S(3, 2) + 3 * S(3, 3) = 3 + 3 * 1 = 6.Therefore, the number of ways to partition the four students into three non-empty subsets is 6. But since the stadiums are distinct, we need to multiply by 3! (the number of ways to assign these subsets to the three stadiums).So, 6 * 6 = 36.Hmm, same result as before. So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, another way to think about this is to consider the possible distributions of students. Since each stadium must have at least one student, and there are four students, the possible distributions in terms of numbers are:1. 2 students in one stadium, and 1 student each in the other two. So, the distribution is 2,1,1.We need to count how many ways this can happen.First, choose which stadium gets 2 students. There are C(3,1) = 3 ways.Then, choose 2 students out of 4 to assign to that stadium. That's C(4,2) = 6.Then, assign the remaining 2 students to the other two stadiums, one each. Since the stadiums are distinct, the number of ways is 2! = 2.So, total for this case: 3 * 6 * 2 = 36.Wait, that's the same as before. So, that's another way to get 36.Alternatively, is there another distribution? Let's see, 4 students into 3 stadiums with each stadium having at least one. The only possible distributions are 2,1,1 because 3,1,0 is invalid (since we can't have a stadium with 0 students). So, 2,1,1 is the only possible distribution.So, that's another way to think about it.Alternatively, maybe using multinomial coefficients.The number of ways to divide 4 students into groups of sizes 2,1,1 is 4! / (2!1!1!) = 12. Then, since the stadiums are distinct, we need to multiply by the number of ways to assign these groups to the stadiums. Since the groups are of different sizes (one group of 2 and two groups of 1), the number of assignments is 3! / (1!1!1!) = 6. Wait, no, actually, the groups are of sizes 2,1,1, so the number of distinct assignments is 3! / (1!2!) = 3. Because the two groups of 1 are indistinct in size.Wait, hold on, maybe not. Let me think.If we have groups of sizes 2,1,1, then assigning them to three distinct stadiums would involve assigning the group of 2 to one stadium, and the two groups of 1 to the other two. Since the two groups of 1 are indistinct in size, the number of distinct assignments is 3 (choose which stadium gets the group of 2, and the other two automatically get the groups of 1). So, total number of ways is 12 * 3 = 36.Yes, that also gives 36.So, regardless of the method I use—whether inclusion-exclusion, Stirling numbers, or multinomial coefficients—I end up with 36 as the total number of allocation methods.Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me recap:Total number of functions: 3^4 = 81.Subtract the cases where at least one stadium is empty.Using inclusion-exclusion:Number of ways where at least one stadium is empty = C(3,1)*2^4 - C(3,2)*1^4 + C(3,3)*0^4.Wait, hold on, is that correct?Wait, the inclusion-exclusion formula is:Number of onto functions = Total functions - C(3,1)*(functions where one specific stadium is empty) + C(3,2)*(functions where two specific stadiums are empty) - C(3,3)*(functions where all three stadiums are empty).But functions where all three stadiums are empty is zero, since we have four students to assign.So, plugging in:Number of onto functions = 3^4 - C(3,1)*2^4 + C(3,2)*1^4 - C(3,3)*0^4.Compute each term:3^4 = 81.C(3,1)*2^4 = 3*16 = 48.C(3,2)*1^4 = 3*1 = 3.C(3,3)*0^4 = 1*0 = 0.So, number of onto functions = 81 - 48 + 3 - 0 = 36.Yes, same result.Alternatively, if I think about it as inclusion-exclusion, the formula is:Number of onto functions = sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k * C(m, k) * (m - k)^n,where m is the number of codomains (stadiums, which is 3) and n is the number of elements (students, which is 4).So, plugging in:sum_{k=0}^{3} (-1)^k * C(3, k) * (3 - k)^4.Which is exactly what I did earlier, giving 36.So, all methods converge to 36.Is there a chance I could have made a mistake in one of these calculations?Let me double-check the inclusion-exclusion:Total functions: 3^4 = 81.Subtract functions where at least one stadium is empty.Number of functions where stadium A is empty: 2^4 = 16. Similarly for stadium B and C. So, 3*16 = 48.But wait, now we've subtracted too much because functions where two stadiums are empty have been subtracted multiple times.So, we need to add back the functions where two stadiums are empty. For each pair of stadiums, the number of functions where both are empty is 1^4 = 1. There are C(3,2) = 3 such pairs. So, add back 3*1 = 3.There's no need to subtract anything for all three stadiums empty because that's zero.So, total onto functions = 81 - 48 + 3 = 36.Yes, that makes sense.Alternatively, thinking about it as assigning each student to a stadium, ensuring no stadium is empty. So, it's similar to arranging the students into the stadiums with each stadium getting at least one.Another way is to think of it as permutations with identical items, but I think I've covered that with the multinomial approach.Wait, another thought: maybe using exponential generating functions? But that might be overcomplicating for this problem.Alternatively, maybe using recursive counting. For example, the number of ways to assign n students to k stadiums with each stadium getting at least one student is k! * S(n, k), where S(n, k) is the Stirling number of the second kind. As I did earlier, S(4,3) = 6, so 6 * 6 = 36.Yes, that's consistent.So, all these methods lead me to believe that the answer is 36.Just to make sure, let me think if there's any alternative perspective.Suppose I fix one student and assign them to a stadium, then assign the remaining students. But that might complicate things because the assignments are interdependent.Alternatively, think of it as arranging the students in a sequence and partitioning them into three non-empty groups, then assigning each group to a stadium. The number of ways to partition four students into three non-empty ordered groups is 3! * S(4,3) = 6 * 6 = 36. So, same result.Alternatively, using the rule of product: first, choose a student to assign to stadium A, then assign the remaining students to the three stadiums with each getting at least one. But that might not be straightforward because after assigning one student to A, the remaining three need to be assigned to three stadiums with each getting at least one, which is similar to the original problem but with one less student.Wait, actually, that might lead to a recursive approach.Let me try that.Let f(n, k) be the number of ways to assign n students to k stadiums with each stadium getting at least one student.We want f(4, 3).We can think of f(n, k) as k * f(n - 1, k - 1) + k * f(n - 1, k).Wait, no, that's not quite right.Actually, the recurrence relation for Stirling numbers is S(n, k) = S(n - 1, k - 1) + k * S(n - 1, k). So, if we consider f(n, k) = k! * S(n, k), then f(n, k) = k * f(n - 1, k - 1) + k * f(n - 1, k).Wait, let me test that.If f(n, k) = k! * S(n, k), then f(n, k) = k * f(n - 1, k - 1) + k * f(n - 1, k).Let me compute f(4, 3):f(4, 3) = 3 * f(3, 2) + 3 * f(3, 3).We know f(3, 2) = 2! * S(3, 2) = 2 * 3 = 6.f(3, 3) = 3! * S(3, 3) = 6 * 1 = 6.So, f(4, 3) = 3 * 6 + 3 * 6 = 18 + 18 = 36.Yes, same result.So, that's another way to get 36.I think I'm confident now that 36 is the correct answer.Just to recap all the methods:1. Inclusion-exclusion: 81 - 48 + 3 = 36.2. Stirling numbers: S(4,3) = 6, multiplied by 3! = 6, giving 36.3. Multinomial coefficients: 4! / (2!1!1!) = 12, multiplied by 3 (choices for which stadium gets 2 students) = 36.4. Recursive approach using f(n, k) = k * f(n - 1, k - 1) + k * f(n - 1, k): f(4,3) = 3*6 + 3*6 = 36.All methods lead to the same answer, so I think it's solid.Therefore, the total number of different allocation methods is 36.**Final Answer**The total number of different allocation methods is boxed{36}."},{"question":"When simplified, the third term in the expansion of (frac{a}{sqrt{x}}-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2})^6 is:textbf{(A)} frac{15}{x}qquad textbf{(B)} -frac{15}{x}qquad textbf{(C)} -frac{6x^2}{a^9} qquad textbf{(D)} frac{20}{a^3}qquad textbf{(E)} -frac{20}{a^3}","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the third term in the expansion of (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}} - frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^6).

I need to find the third term, which would correspond to (k = 2) because the first term is (k = 0), the second is (k = 1), and the third is (k = 2).Let me write down the general term formula:[binom{6}{k} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^{6 - k} left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^k]So, plugging in (k = 2):[binom{6}{2} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^{6 - 2} left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2]First, let me compute the binomial coefficient (binom{6}{2}). I know that (binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}), so:[binom{6}{2} = frac{6!}{2!4!} = frac{720}{2 times 24} = frac{720}{48} = 15]Okay, so the coefficient is 15. Now, let's compute the rest of the term.Starting with (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^{4}):[left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^4 = frac{a^4}{(sqrt{x})^4} = frac{a^4}{x^{2}}]Because ((sqrt{x})^4 = x^{4/2} = x^2).Next, compute (left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2):[left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2 = left(-1right)^2 times left(frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2 = 1 times frac{x}{a^4} = frac{x}{a^4}]So, putting it all together:[15 times frac{a^4}{x^2} times frac{x}{a^4}]Let me simplify this step by step. First, multiply the coefficients:15 remains as it is.Now, multiply the fractions:[frac{a^4}{x^2} times frac{x}{a^4} = frac{a^4 times x}{x^2 times a^4}]I can cancel out (a^4) in the numerator and denominator:[frac{x}{x^2} = frac{1}{x}]So, the entire term simplifies to:[15 times frac{1}{x} = frac{15}{x}]Wait, but hold on a second. I remember that when I squared (left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)), the negative sign became positive because ((-1)^2 = 1). So, the term is positive. But let me double-check the original expression.The original expression is (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}} - frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^6). So, the second term is negative, but when we square it, it becomes positive. So, yes, the third term is positive.But looking at the answer choices, option A is (frac{15}{x}) and option B is (-frac{15}{x}). So, according to my calculation, it's positive 15/x. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent signs.Wait, the term is (left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2), which is positive, so the term is positive. So, the third term is positive 15/x, which is option A.But hold on, let me think again. The first term is when (k = 0), which is (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^6), the second term is when (k = 1), which is negative, and the third term is when (k = 2), which is positive. So, the third term is positive. So, 15/x is correct, which is option A.Wait, but let me check the original problem again. It says \\"the third term in the expansion\\". So, in the expansion, the terms are ordered from the highest power of (frac{a}{sqrt{x}}) to the lowest. So, the first term is (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^6), the second term is (binom{6}{1} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^5 left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^1), and the third term is the one we calculated, which is positive 15/x.But wait, hold on. Let me compute the second term as well to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the order.First term: (k = 0):[binom{6}{0} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^6 left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^0 = 1 times frac{a^6}{x^3} times 1 = frac{a^6}{x^3}]Second term: (k = 1):[binom{6}{1} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^5 left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^1 = 6 times frac{a^5}{x^{5/2}} times left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right) = 6 times frac{a^5}{x^{5/2}} times left(-frac{x^{1/2}}{a^2}right)]Simplifying:Multiply the coefficients: 6 * (-1) = -6Multiply the variables:[frac{a^5}{x^{5/2}} times frac{x^{1/2}}{a^2} = frac{a^{5 - 2}}{x^{5/2 - 1/2}} = frac{a^3}{x^{2}}]So, the second term is:[-6 times frac{a^3}{x^2} = -frac{6a^3}{x^2}]Okay, so the second term is negative. Then the third term is positive, as we calculated earlier. So, the third term is (frac{15}{x}), which is option A.But wait, hold on. The answer choices include option E as (-frac{20}{a^3}), which is different. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.Wait, let me check my calculation again for the third term.Third term, (k = 2):[binom{6}{2} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^{4} left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2]Compute each part:Binomial coefficient: 15, correct.(left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^4 = frac{a^4}{x^2}), correct.(left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2 = frac{x}{a^4}), correct.Multiplying together:15 * (a^4 / x^2) * (x / a^4) = 15 * (a^4 / a^4) * (x / x^2) = 15 * 1 * (1 / x) = 15 / x.So, that seems correct. So, the third term is 15/x, which is option A.Wait, but the options are:A) 15/xB) -15/xC) -6x^2 / a^9D) 20 / a^3E) -20 / a^3So, 15/x is option A, which is positive. So, unless I made a mistake in the sign, that should be correct.Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}} - frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^6). So, the second term is negative, but when we square it, it becomes positive. So, the third term is positive.But wait, in the expansion, the signs alternate because of the negative sign in the second term. So, the first term is positive, the second term is negative, the third term is positive, the fourth term is negative, and so on.So, that would mean the third term is positive, which is 15/x, so option A.But wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says \\"the third term in the expansion\\". So, in the expansion, the terms are ordered from the highest power of the first term to the lowest. So, the first term is (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^6), the second term is (binom{6}{1} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^5 left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^1), the third term is (binom{6}{2} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^4 left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2), which is positive, as we found.So, that should be 15/x, which is option A.Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people count terms starting from the constant term or something else, but in binomial expansions, the terms are ordered from the highest power of the first element to the lowest. So, in this case, the first term is the highest power of (frac{a}{sqrt{x}}), which is 6, then 5, then 4, etc.So, yeah, the third term is 15/x, which is option A.But wait, let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the exponents.Wait, (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^4) is (a^4 / x^2), correct.(left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2) is (x / a^4), correct.Multiplying these together: (a^4 / x^2 * x / a^4 = (a^4 / a^4) * (x / x^2) = 1 * (1 / x) = 1/x). So, 15 * 1/x = 15/x.Yes, that seems correct.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the question is considering the terms in a different order? Like, starting from the lowest power of x?But no, in binomial expansions, the order is from the highest power of the first term to the lowest. So, the first term is the highest power of (frac{a}{sqrt{x}}), which is 6, then 5, then 4, etc.So, the third term is when the exponent is 4, which is 15/x.Therefore, the answer should be A) 15/x.Wait, but hold on, let me check the answer choices again. The options are:A) 15/xB) -15/xC) -6x²/a⁹D) 20/a³E) -20/a³So, 15/x is an option, but I also notice that option E is -20/a³, which is different.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the term. Let me go through it again.Third term: (k = 2).[binom{6}{2} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^{4} left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2]Compute each part:Binomial coefficient: 15.(left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^4 = a^4 / x^2).(left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2 = ( (-1)^2 ) * ( (sqrt{x})^2 / (a^2)^2 ) = 1 * (x / a^4 ) = x / a^4.Multiply all together:15 * (a^4 / x^2) * (x / a^4) = 15 * (a^4 / a^4) * (x / x^2) = 15 * 1 * (1 / x) = 15 / x.So, that's correct.Wait, but maybe I miscounted the term. Let me list all the terms:First term: (k = 0): (binom{6}{0} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^6 left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^0 = frac{a^6}{x^3}).Second term: (k = 1): (binom{6}{1} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^5 left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^1 = 6 * frac{a^5}{x^{5/2}} * (-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}) = -6 * frac{a^5}{x^{5/2}} * frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2} = -6 * frac{a^3}{x^2}).Third term: (k = 2): 15 * (frac{a^4}{x^2}) * (frac{x}{a^4}) = 15 / x.Fourth term: (k = 3): (binom{6}{3} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^3 left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^3 = 20 * frac{a^3}{x^{3/2}} * (-frac{x^{3/2}}{a^6}) = 20 * (-1)^3 * frac{a^3}{x^{3/2}} * frac{x^{3/2}}{a^6} = -20 * frac{1}{a^3}).Wait, hold on, the fourth term is (-20 / a^3), which is option E. But the question asks for the third term, which is 15/x, option A.Wait, but maybe I miscounted the terms. Let me list them:1. (k = 0): (frac{a^6}{x^3})2. (k = 1): (-6 frac{a^3}{x^2})3. (k = 2): (15 / x)4. (k = 3): (-20 / a^3)5. (k = 4): ... and so on.So, the third term is indeed 15/x, which is option A.But wait, the answer choices include option E as (-20 / a^3), which is the fourth term. So, maybe the question is referring to the third term from the end? But that would be the fourth term, which is (-20 / a^3), option E.Wait, but the question says \\"the third term in the expansion\\". In binomial expansions, the terms are ordered from the highest power of the first term to the lowest, so the first term is the highest power, the second term is the next, etc. So, the third term is the one with (k = 2), which is 15/x.But let me check the problem statement again to make sure.\\"the third term in the expansion of (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}} - frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^6)\\".Yes, it's the third term in the expansion, so the order is from the highest power of (frac{a}{sqrt{x}}) to the lowest, so the first term is (frac{a^6}{x^3}), the second is (-6 frac{a^3}{x^2}), the third is (15 / x), which is option A.But wait, let me check the answer choices again. Option A is 15/x, which is correct. But in the initial problem, the options are:A) 15/xB) -15/xC) -6x²/a⁹D) 20/a³E) -20/a³So, 15/x is an option, which is A. So, unless I made a mistake in the calculation, that should be the correct answer.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.Wait, (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^4 = a^4 / x^{2}), correct.(left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2 = x / a^4), correct.Multiplying them: (a^4 / x^2 * x / a^4 = 1 / x), correct.So, 15 * 1 / x = 15 / x.Yes, that seems correct.Wait, but let me check the fourth term as well, just to make sure.Fourth term: (k = 3):[binom{6}{3} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^{3} left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^3]Compute each part:Binomial coefficient: 20.(left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^3 = a^3 / x^{3/2}).(left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^3 = (-1)^3 * (sqrt{x})^3 / (a^2)^3 = -x^{3/2} / a^6).Multiplying together:20 * (a^3 / x^{3/2}) * (-x^{3/2} / a^6) = 20 * (-1) * (a^3 / a^6) * (x^{3/2} / x^{3/2}) = -20 * (1 / a^3) * 1 = -20 / a^3.So, the fourth term is -20 / a^3, which is option E.But the question is about the third term, which is 15 / x, option A.Wait, but the answer choices don't have 15/x as the correct answer? Wait, no, they do. Option A is 15/x.Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the options are:A) 15/xB) -15/xC) -6x²/a⁹D) 20/a³E) -20/a³So, 15/x is an option, which is A.But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes in binomial expansions, people might consider the constant term or something else as the first term, but in this case, the first term is clearly the highest power of (frac{a}{sqrt{x}}), which is 6.Therefore, the third term is 15/x, which is option A.Wait, but let me check if the problem is written correctly. It says (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}} - frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^6). So, the first term is (frac{a}{sqrt{x}}), the second term is (-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}).So, in the expansion, the first term is (left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^6), the second term is (binom{6}{1} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^5 left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^1), the third term is (binom{6}{2} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^4 left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2), which is 15/x.Therefore, the answer should be A) 15/x.But wait, hold on. Let me check the problem again. It says \\"the third term in the expansion\\". So, if I expand the expression, the terms are:1. (frac{a^6}{x^3})2. (-6 frac{a^3}{x^2})3. (15 / x)4. (-20 / a^3)5. (15 frac{x}{a^6})6. (-6 frac{x^2}{a^9})7. (frac{x^3}{a^{12}})Wait, hold on, that's 7 terms because the exponent is 6. So, the third term is indeed 15/x.But wait, in the answer choices, option A is 15/x, which is correct.Wait, but in the initial problem, the options are:A) 15/xB) -15/xC) -6x²/a⁹D) 20/a³E) -20/a³So, 15/x is an option, which is A.Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when people say \\"simplified\\", they might consider combining like terms or something else, but in this case, each term is distinct.Wait, let me check the expansion again.First term: (frac{a^6}{x^3})Second term: (-6 frac{a^3}{x^2})Third term: (15 / x)Fourth term: (-20 / a^3)Fifth term: (15 frac{x}{a^6})Sixth term: (-6 frac{x^2}{a^9})Seventh term: (frac{x^3}{a^{12}})So, the third term is 15/x, which is option A.Therefore, the answer is A) 15/x.Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute the term again.Third term: (k = 2):[binom{6}{2} left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^{4} left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2]Compute each part:Binomial coefficient: 15.(left(frac{a}{sqrt{x}}right)^4 = a^4 / x^2).(left(-frac{sqrt{x}}{a^2}right)^2 = ( (-1)^2 ) * ( (sqrt{x})^2 / (a^2)^2 ) = 1 * (x / a^4 ) = x / a^4.Multiplying all together:15 * (a^4 / x^2) * (x / a^4) = 15 * (a^4 / a^4) * (x / x^2) = 15 * 1 * (1 / x) = 15 / x.Yes, that's correct.So, the third term is 15/x, which is option A.Wait, but I just noticed that in the problem statement, the options are:A) 15/xB) -15/xC) -6x²/a⁹D) 20/a³E) -20/a³So, 15/x is an option, which is A.Therefore, the answer is A) 15/x.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I miscounted the terms. Let me list them again:1. (k = 0): (frac{a^6}{x^3})2. (k = 1): (-6 frac{a^3}{x^2})3. (k = 2): (15 / x)4. (k = 3): (-20 / a^3)5. (k = 4): (15 frac{x}{a^6})6. (k = 5): (-6 frac{x^2}{a^9})7. (k = 6): (frac{x^3}{a^{12}})Yes, so the third term is indeed 15/x, which is option A.Therefore, I think the correct answer is A) 15/x.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Compute[frac{(10^4+324)(22^4+324)(34^4+324)(46^4+324)(58^4+324)}{(4^4+324)(16^4+324)(28^4+324)(40^4+324)(52^4+324)}.]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem to compute a big fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are products of terms of the form (x^4 + 324). The numerator is ((10^4 + 324)(22^4 + 324)(34^4 + 324)(46^4 + 324)(58^4 + 324)) and the denominator is ((4^4 + 324)(16^4 + 324)(28^4 + 324)(40^4 + 324)(52^4 + 324)). Hmm, that's quite a mouthful. I need to find a way to simplify this without calculating each term individually because that would take forever and probably isn't the right approach.First, I notice that both the numerator and the denominator have five terms each, and each term is of the form (x^4 + 324). Maybe there's a pattern or a factorization that can help simplify each of these terms. I remember that expressions like (x^4 + a^4) can sometimes be factored using the Sophie Germain identity, which is (x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2)). Let me check if that applies here.In this case, each term is (x^4 + 324). Let me see if 324 can be written as (4y^4). So, 324 divided by 4 is 81, which is (3^4). So, (324 = 4 times 81 = 4 times 3^4). Therefore, (x^4 + 324 = x^4 + 4 times 3^4). That fits the Sophie Germain identity!So, applying the identity, (x^4 + 4 times 3^4 = (x^2 + 2 times x times 3 + 2 times 3^2)(x^2 - 2 times x times 3 + 2 times 3^2)). Simplifying that, it becomes ((x^2 + 6x + 18)(x^2 - 6x + 18)). So each term (x^4 + 324) factors into two quadratics: ((x^2 + 6x + 18)(x^2 - 6x + 18)).Great, so now I can rewrite each term in both the numerator and the denominator using this factorization. Let's do that step by step.Starting with the numerator:1. (10^4 + 324 = (10^2 + 6 times 10 + 18)(10^2 - 6 times 10 + 18) = (100 + 60 + 18)(100 - 60 + 18) = (178)(58))2. (22^4 + 324 = (22^2 + 6 times 22 + 18)(22^2 - 6 times 22 + 18) = (484 + 132 + 18)(484 - 132 + 18) = (634)(370))3. (34^4 + 324 = (34^2 + 6 times 34 + 18)(34^2 - 6 times 34 + 18) = (1156 + 204 + 18)(1156 - 204 + 18) = (1378)(970))4. (46^4 + 324 = (46^2 + 6 times 46 + 18)(46^2 - 6 times 46 + 18) = (2116 + 276 + 18)(2116 - 276 + 18) = (2410)(1858))5. (58^4 + 324 = (58^2 + 6 times 58 + 18)(58^2 - 6 times 58 + 18) = (3364 + 348 + 18)(3364 - 348 + 18) = (3730)(3034))Now, the denominator:1. (4^4 + 324 = (4^2 + 6 times 4 + 18)(4^2 - 6 times 4 + 18) = (16 + 24 + 18)(16 - 24 + 18) = (58)(10))2. (16^4 + 324 = (16^2 + 6 times 16 + 18)(16^2 - 6 times 16 + 18) = (256 + 96 + 18)(256 - 96 + 18) = (370)(178))3. (28^4 + 324 = (28^2 + 6 times 28 + 18)(28^2 - 6 times 28 + 18) = (784 + 168 + 18)(784 - 168 + 18) = (970)(634))4. (40^4 + 324 = (40^2 + 6 times 40 + 18)(40^2 - 6 times 40 + 18) = (1600 + 240 + 18)(1600 - 240 + 18) = (1858)(1378))5. (52^4 + 324 = (52^2 + 6 times 52 + 18)(52^2 - 6 times 52 + 18) = (2704 + 312 + 18)(2704 - 312 + 18) = (3034)(2410))Okay, so now both numerator and denominator are products of these quadratic factors. Let me write them out:Numerator:- (178)(58) * (634)(370) * (1378)(970) * (2410)(1858) * (3730)(3034)Denominator:- (58)(10) * (370)(178) * (970)(634) * (1858)(1378) * (3034)(2410)Hmm, looking at this, I can see that each pair in the numerator has a corresponding pair in the denominator. Let me list them:Numerator terms:1. 178, 582. 634, 3703. 1378, 9704. 2410, 18585. 3730, 3034Denominator terms:1. 58, 102. 370, 1783. 970, 6344. 1858, 13785. 3034, 2410So, if I write out the entire fraction, it's:[frac{(178 times 58) times (634 times 370) times (1378 times 970) times (2410 times 1858) times (3730 times 3034)}{(58 times 10) times (370 times 178) times (970 times 634) times (1858 times 1378) times (3034 times 2410)}]Now, I can see that many terms will cancel out. Let's go through each pair:1. 178 in the numerator cancels with 178 in the denominator.2. 58 in the numerator cancels with 58 in the denominator.3. 634 in the numerator cancels with 634 in the denominator.4. 370 in the numerator cancels with 370 in the denominator.5. 1378 in the numerator cancels with 1378 in the denominator.6. 970 in the numerator cancels with 970 in the denominator.7. 2410 in the numerator cancels with 2410 in the denominator.8. 1858 in the numerator cancels with 1858 in the denominator.9. 3730 in the numerator doesn't have a corresponding term in the denominator.10. 3034 in the numerator cancels with 3034 in the denominator.11. 10 in the denominator doesn't have a corresponding term in the numerator.Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. After cancellation, what's left?Looking at the numerator, after cancellation, we have:- 3730 (from the last numerator term) and nothing else.In the denominator, after cancellation, we have:- 10 (from the first denominator term) and nothing else.Wait, is that correct? Let me list all the terms:Numerator terms after expansion:178, 58, 634, 370, 1378, 970, 2410, 1858, 3730, 3034Denominator terms after expansion:58, 10, 370, 178, 970, 634, 1858, 1378, 3034, 2410So, each term in the numerator is present in the denominator except for 3730, and each term in the denominator is present in the numerator except for 10. So, when we cancel all the common terms, we are left with:Numerator: 3730Denominator: 10Therefore, the entire fraction simplifies to ( frac{3730}{10} ).Simplifying that, 3730 divided by 10 is 373. So, the value of the original fraction is 373.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the cancellation. Each pair in the numerator and denominator cancels except for the first term in the denominator (10) and the last term in the numerator (3730). So, yes, 3730 divided by 10 is indeed 373.Therefore, the answer should be 373.**Final Answer**boxed{373}"},{"question":"Anna Alexandrovna's age is 60 years, 60 months, 60 weeks, 60 days, and 60 hours. How many full years old is Anna Alexandrovna?","answer":"First, I need to convert all the given time units into years to find Anna Alexandrovna's total age in full years.Starting with the months, there are 12 months in a year. So, 60 months divided by 12 equals 5 years.Next, for the weeks, there are 52 weeks in a year. Dividing 60 weeks by 52 gives approximately 1.1538 years.For the days, there are 365 days in a year. Dividing 60 days by 365 results in roughly 0.1644 years.Lastly, converting the hours into years involves dividing by the number of hours in a year, which is 365 days multiplied by 24 hours, totaling 8760 hours. So, 60 hours divided by 8760 is approximately 0.0068 years.Adding all these converted years together: 60 years + 5 years + 1.1538 years + 0.1644 years + 0.0068 years equals approximately 66.324 years.Since the question asks for the full years, I round down to the nearest whole number, which is 66 years."},{"question":"When a class of math students lined up for a class picture on Picture Day, they found that when they stood in rows of four there was one person left over. When they formed rows of five students, there were two extra students, and when they lined up in rows of seven, there were three students left over. What is the fewest number of students possible in this class?","answer":"To determine the smallest number of students that satisfies all the given conditions, I'll analyze each condition step by step.First, when the students stand in rows of four, there's one person left over. This means the total number of students, which I'll call N, can be expressed as N = 4k + 1, where k is an integer.Next, when they form rows of five, there are two extra students. So, N can also be written as N = 5m + 2, where m is another integer.Lastly, when lining up in rows of seven, there are three students left over. Therefore, N = 7n + 3, where n is an integer.To find the smallest N that satisfies all three equations, I'll list the possible values for each condition and look for the common value.For N = 4k + 1, the possible numbers are 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, 85, 89, 93, 97, 101, and so on.For N = 5m + 2, the possible numbers are 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, 52, 57, 62, 67, 72, 77, 82, 87, 92, 97, 102, and so on.For N = 7n + 3, the possible numbers are 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59, 66, 73, 80, 87, 94, 101, and so on.Looking for the smallest number that appears in all three lists, I find that 17 is the first number that satisfies all three conditions."},{"question":"There are 35 squares and triangles in total, with 120 edges.

The options are A) 5, B) 2, C) 8, D) 6, E) 12.Hmm, let me think. I remember that for a number to be a perfect cube, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be multiples of 3. So, I need to make sure that each exponent in the prime factors of N is divisible by 3.Looking at N, it's already broken down into prime factors: 7, 5, and 2. So, let's write down each exponent:- For 7: the exponent is ( p + 4 )- For 5: the exponent is ( q )- For 2: the exponent is 3So, each of these exponents needs to be a multiple of 3.Starting with 2: the exponent is already 3, which is a multiple of 3. So, that one is fine. I don't need to do anything about the exponent of 2.Now, moving on to 7: the exponent is ( p + 4 ). I need ( p + 4 ) to be a multiple of 3. So, ( p + 4 equiv 0 mod 3 ). That means ( p equiv -4 mod 3 ). But since we're dealing with positive integers, let me think about it differently.What's the smallest positive integer p such that ( p + 4 ) is divisible by 3? Let's try p=2: 2 + 4 = 6, which is divisible by 3. So, p=2 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition.Wait, hold on. Let me check p=1: 1 + 4 = 5, which isn't divisible by 3. p=2: 6, which is good. So, p=2 is the smallest.Now, moving on to 5: the exponent is ( q ). So, ( q ) must be a multiple of 3. The smallest positive integer q is 3, right? Because 3 is the smallest multiple of 3.So, if p=2 and q=3, then ( p + q = 2 + 3 = 5 ). Hmm, 5 is one of the options, option A. But wait, let me double-check if there's a smaller p + q possible.Wait, maybe I can find a smaller p or q? Let's see.For p: p must be such that ( p + 4 ) is a multiple of 3. The next possible p after 2 would be 5, because 5 + 4 = 9, which is also a multiple of 3. But 5 is larger than 2, so p=2 is indeed the smallest.For q: q must be a multiple of 3. The smallest positive integer is 3, as I thought. If I take q=3, that's the smallest. If I take q=0, but wait, q has to be a positive integer, so q=0 isn't allowed. So, q=3 is the smallest.Therefore, p=2 and q=3, so p + q = 5. That's option A.Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \\"the smallest possible value of ( p + q )\\". So, is 5 the smallest possible? Let me see.Is there a way to have p=2 and q=3, which gives 5, or is there a way to get a smaller sum?Wait, if p=2, q=3, sum is 5. If p=5, q=3, sum is 8. If p=2, q=6, sum is 8. So, 5 is indeed the smallest.But wait, let me check if p=2 and q=3 actually make N a perfect cube.So, plugging in p=2 and q=3:N = ( 7^{2+4} times 5^{3} times 2^{3} = 7^{6} times 5^{3} times 2^{3} ).Each exponent is 6, 3, and 3, which are all multiples of 3. So, N is indeed a perfect cube. So, that works.Is there a way to have p and q smaller? Let's see.If p=1, then ( p + 4 = 5 ), which isn't a multiple of 3. So, p=1 doesn't work.If p=2, that's the smallest p that works. For q, q=1: 1 isn't a multiple of 3, so N wouldn't be a perfect cube. q=2: same thing, 2 isn't a multiple of 3. q=3 is the first that works.So, p=2 and q=3, sum is 5. So, the answer should be A) 5.Wait, but hold on, the options include 6, which is D. Maybe I made a mistake?Wait, let me check again. Maybe I misread the problem.Wait, the problem says N is equal to ( 7^{p+4} times 5^{q} times 2^{3} ). So, 2 is raised to the 3rd power, which is fine. 7 is raised to ( p + 4 ), which needs to be a multiple of 3, and 5 is raised to q, which also needs to be a multiple of 3.So, p + 4 must be a multiple of 3, and q must be a multiple of 3.So, p must satisfy ( p + 4 equiv 0 mod 3 ), so ( p equiv -4 mod 3 ), which is equivalent to ( p equiv 2 mod 3 ). So, the smallest positive integer p is 2.Similarly, q must be a multiple of 3, so the smallest is 3.Therefore, p=2 and q=3, so p + q=5, which is option A.Wait, but the options are A)5, B)2, C)8, D)6, E)12.So, 5 is an option, so that should be the answer.But hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.Wait, N is given as ( 7^{p+4} times 5^{q} times 2^{3} ). So, 2 is already at 3, which is fine. 7 is at ( p + 4 ), which needs to be a multiple of 3. 5 is at q, which needs to be a multiple of 3.So, p must be such that ( p + 4 ) is a multiple of 3. So, p can be 2, 5, 8, etc.q must be 3, 6, 9, etc.So, the minimal p is 2, minimal q is 3, so p + q is 5.Therefore, the answer is A)5.Wait, but in the initial problem, the options are A)5, B)2, C)8, D)6, E)12.So, 5 is an option, so that's the answer.But wait, hold on, let me think again. Maybe I can have p=2 and q=3, but is there a way to have p and q smaller? For example, p=2 is the smallest p, q=3 is the smallest q. So, 2 and 3 are the minimal exponents.Wait, but if p=2, q=3, then p + q=5. If p=5, q=3, then p + q=8. If p=2, q=6, p + q=8. So, 5 is indeed the smallest.Wait, but why is option D)6 there? Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.The problem says N is equal to ( 7^{p+4} times 5^{q} times 2^{3} ). So, is it possible that the exponent for 2 is 3, but maybe I need to adjust it as well? Wait, 2^3 is already a perfect cube, so that's fine.Wait, unless I need to combine the exponents or something? Hmm, no, each prime factor is separate.Wait, another thought: maybe I need to make sure that all exponents are multiples of 3, but perhaps the exponents can be adjusted by adding more factors? Wait, no, because N is given as that product, so we can't add more factors. We just need to choose p and q such that the exponents are multiples of 3.So, yeah, p + 4 must be a multiple of 3, and q must be a multiple of 3. So, p=2, q=3, sum=5.Wait, so why is 6 an option? Maybe I made a mistake in thinking that p=2 is the smallest. Let me check p=2: 2 + 4=6, which is a multiple of 3. So, that's correct. So, p=2 is the smallest.Wait, unless p is allowed to be zero? But the problem says p and q are positive integers, so p must be at least 1. So, p=1: 1 + 4=5, which isn't a multiple of 3. So, p=2 is the smallest.Similarly, q must be at least 3, since q=1 and 2 aren't multiples of 3.So, p + q=5 is the minimal sum.Therefore, the answer is A)5.Wait, but hold on, in the initial problem statement, it's written as ( 7^{p+4} times 5^{q} times 2^{3} ). So, 2 is raised to the 3rd power, which is fine, as 3 is a multiple of 3. So, no problem there.So, yeah, I think 5 is the correct answer. Maybe the option D)6 is a trap if someone miscalculates.Wait, let me think again: if p=2, q=3, then N is ( 7^{6} times 5^{3} times 2^{3} ). So, each exponent is 6, 3, 3. So, N is ( (7^{2} times 5^{1} times 2^{1})^{3} ). So, yes, that's a perfect cube.Therefore, p=2, q=3 is correct, sum is 5.So, the answer is A)5.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"If the function ( f ) is defined as ( f(x) = ax^2 - sqrt{2} ), where ( a ) is a constant, and if ( f(f(sqrt{2})) = -sqrt{2} ), then what is ( a )?(A) ( frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{2} )  (B) ( frac{1}{2} )  (C) ( 2 - sqrt{2} )  (D) ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} )  (E) ( frac{2 + sqrt{2}}{2} )","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where the function ( f ) is defined as ( f(x) = ax^2 - sqrt{2} ), and I need to find the value of ( a ) given that ( f(f(sqrt{2})) = -sqrt{2} ). The options are given, so I can check my answer at the end, but I need to figure it out step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem. The function ( f ) takes an input ( x ), squares it, multiplies by a constant ( a ), and then subtracts ( sqrt{2} ). So, ( f(x) = ax^2 - sqrt{2} ). Now, they're telling me that if I apply this function twice to ( sqrt{2} ), I get ( -sqrt{2} ). So, ( f(f(sqrt{2})) = -sqrt{2} ). I need to find the value of ( a ) that satisfies this condition.Alright, let's break this down. I think the strategy here is to compute ( f(sqrt{2}) ) first, and then plug that result back into ( f ) again to get ( f(f(sqrt{2})) ), and set that equal to ( -sqrt{2} ). Then, solve for ( a ).So, let's start by computing ( f(sqrt{2}) ). Using the definition of ( f ):( f(sqrt{2}) = a (sqrt{2})^2 - sqrt{2} ).Hmm, okay. Let me compute ( (sqrt{2})^2 ). That's just ( 2 ), right? Because squaring a square root cancels them out. So, ( (sqrt{2})^2 = 2 ). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:( f(sqrt{2}) = a times 2 - sqrt{2} ).Which is ( 2a - sqrt{2} ). Got that.Now, we need to compute ( f(f(sqrt{2})) ), which is ( f(2a - sqrt{2}) ). So, let's plug ( 2a - sqrt{2} ) into the function ( f ):( f(2a - sqrt{2}) = a (2a - sqrt{2})^2 - sqrt{2} ).Okay, so I need to compute ( (2a - sqrt{2})^2 ) first. Let me expand that. Remember, ( (b - c)^2 = b^2 - 2bc + c^2 ). So, applying that here:( (2a - sqrt{2})^2 = (2a)^2 - 2 times 2a times sqrt{2} + (sqrt{2})^2 ).Calculating each term:1. ( (2a)^2 = 4a^2 ).2. ( 2 times 2a times sqrt{2} = 4asqrt{2} ).3. ( (sqrt{2})^2 = 2 ).Putting it all together:( (2a - sqrt{2})^2 = 4a^2 - 4asqrt{2} + 2 ).So, now plug this back into the expression for ( f(2a - sqrt{2}) ):( f(2a - sqrt{2}) = a (4a^2 - 4asqrt{2} + 2) - sqrt{2} ).Let me distribute the ( a ) across the terms inside the parentheses:( f(2a - sqrt{2}) = 4a^3 - 4a^2sqrt{2} + 2a - sqrt{2} ).So, according to the problem, this is equal to ( -sqrt{2} ). Therefore, we can set up the equation:( 4a^3 - 4a^2sqrt{2} + 2a - sqrt{2} = -sqrt{2} ).Hmm, okay. Let's subtract ( -sqrt{2} ) from both sides to bring everything to one side:( 4a^3 - 4a^2sqrt{2} + 2a - sqrt{2} + sqrt{2} = 0 ).Wait, that simplifies because ( -sqrt{2} + sqrt{2} = 0 ). So, the equation becomes:( 4a^3 - 4a^2sqrt{2} + 2a = 0 ).So, now we have a cubic equation in terms of ( a ):( 4a^3 - 4sqrt{2}a^2 + 2a = 0 ).Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can factor out a common term. Let's see:Looking at each term, they all have a factor of ( 2a ). Let me factor that out:( 2a(2a^2 - 2sqrt{2}a + 1) = 0 ).So, now we have:( 2a(2a^2 - 2sqrt{2}a + 1) = 0 ).This gives us two possibilities:1. ( 2a = 0 ) which implies ( a = 0 ).2. ( 2a^2 - 2sqrt{2}a + 1 = 0 ).But let's think about this. If ( a = 0 ), then the function ( f(x) = 0 times x^2 - sqrt{2} = -sqrt{2} ). So, ( f(x) ) would be a constant function, always equal to ( -sqrt{2} ). Then, ( f(f(sqrt{2})) = f(-sqrt{2}) = -sqrt{2} ). So, actually, ( a = 0 ) does satisfy the equation ( f(f(sqrt{2})) = -sqrt{2} ). But looking at the answer choices, ( 0 ) isn't one of them. The options are ( frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{2} ), ( frac{1}{2} ), ( 2 - sqrt{2} ), ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), and ( frac{2 + sqrt{2}}{2} ). So, ( a = 0 ) is not an option, which suggests that maybe ( a = 0 ) is not a valid solution in this context, or perhaps I made a mistake.Wait, but let's check if ( a = 0 ) is actually a valid solution. If ( a = 0 ), then ( f(x) = -sqrt{2} ) for any ( x ). So, ( f(sqrt{2}) = -sqrt{2} ), and then ( f(f(sqrt{2})) = f(-sqrt{2}) = -sqrt{2} ). So, yes, it does satisfy the condition. But since ( a = 0 ) isn't an option, maybe I need to consider the other factor.So, moving on to the quadratic equation:( 2a^2 - 2sqrt{2}a + 1 = 0 ).Let me write this as:( 2a^2 - 2sqrt{2}a + 1 = 0 ).This is a quadratic in terms of ( a ). Let's try solving for ( a ) using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is of the form ( pa^2 + qa + r = 0 ), where ( p = 2 ), ( q = -2sqrt{2} ), and ( r = 1 ).The quadratic formula is:( a = frac{-q pm sqrt{q^2 - 4pr}}{2p} ).Plugging in the values:( a = frac{-(-2sqrt{2}) pm sqrt{(-2sqrt{2})^2 - 4 times 2 times 1}}{2 times 2} ).Simplify each part step by step.First, compute the numerator:1. ( -(-2sqrt{2}) = 2sqrt{2} ).2. Compute the discriminant ( D = (-2sqrt{2})^2 - 4 times 2 times 1 ).Calculating ( (-2sqrt{2})^2 ):( (-2sqrt{2})^2 = (-2)^2 times (sqrt{2})^2 = 4 times 2 = 8 ).Then, compute ( 4 times 2 times 1 = 8 ).So, the discriminant ( D = 8 - 8 = 0 ).Wait, so the discriminant is zero. That means there's exactly one real solution (a repeated root). So, the square root part becomes ( sqrt{0} = 0 ).Therefore, the solution is:( a = frac{2sqrt{2} pm 0}{4} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ).So, ( a = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ).Hmm, let me check if this is one of the options. Looking back, option D is ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), so that's a possible answer.But wait, earlier, I had ( a = 0 ) as a solution, but it's not an option. So, perhaps the problem expects ( a ) to be non-zero, or maybe ( a = 0 ) is trivial and they're looking for the non-trivial solution. So, ( a = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) is the solution.But just to make sure, let me verify this. Let me plug ( a = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) back into the function and check if ( f(f(sqrt{2})) = -sqrt{2} ).First, compute ( f(sqrt{2}) ):( f(sqrt{2}) = a (sqrt{2})^2 - sqrt{2} = a times 2 - sqrt{2} ).Substituting ( a = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ):( f(sqrt{2}) = 2 times frac{sqrt{2}}{2} - sqrt{2} = sqrt{2} - sqrt{2} = 0 ).So, ( f(sqrt{2}) = 0 ).Now, compute ( f(f(sqrt{2})) = f(0) ):( f(0) = a times 0^2 - sqrt{2} = 0 - sqrt{2} = -sqrt{2} ).Which is exactly what we needed. So, yes, ( a = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) works.Wait, but hold on. Let me check if there are any other solutions. The quadratic equation gave me only one solution because the discriminant was zero. So, only ( a = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) is the solution from the quadratic. And ( a = 0 ) is another solution, but it's not in the options. So, the answer must be ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), which is option D.But just to be thorough, let me check if any of the other options could work, just in case I made a mistake somewhere.Let me try option B, which is ( frac{1}{2} ). Let's see if that works.Compute ( f(sqrt{2}) ):( f(sqrt{2}) = frac{1}{2} times 2 - sqrt{2} = 1 - sqrt{2} ).Then, compute ( f(1 - sqrt{2}) ):( f(1 - sqrt{2}) = frac{1}{2} times (1 - sqrt{2})^2 - sqrt{2} ).Compute ( (1 - sqrt{2})^2 = 1 - 2sqrt{2} + 2 = 3 - 2sqrt{2} ).So, ( f(1 - sqrt{2}) = frac{1}{2} times (3 - 2sqrt{2}) - sqrt{2} = frac{3}{2} - sqrt{2} - sqrt{2} = frac{3}{2} - 2sqrt{2} ).Which is not equal to ( -sqrt{2} ). So, option B is incorrect.How about option C: ( 2 - sqrt{2} ).Compute ( f(sqrt{2}) = (2 - sqrt{2}) times 2 - sqrt{2} = 4 - 2sqrt{2} - sqrt{2} = 4 - 3sqrt{2} ).Then, compute ( f(4 - 3sqrt{2}) = (2 - sqrt{2}) times (4 - 3sqrt{2})^2 - sqrt{2} ).Wait, that seems complicated. Let me compute ( (4 - 3sqrt{2})^2 ):( (4 - 3sqrt{2})^2 = 16 - 24sqrt{2} + 9 times 2 = 16 - 24sqrt{2} + 18 = 34 - 24sqrt{2} ).So, ( f(4 - 3sqrt{2}) = (2 - sqrt{2})(34 - 24sqrt{2}) - sqrt{2} ).Let me compute this:First, multiply ( 2 times 34 = 68 ).Then, ( 2 times (-24sqrt{2}) = -48sqrt{2} ).Then, ( -sqrt{2} times 34 = -34sqrt{2} ).Then, ( -sqrt{2} times (-24sqrt{2}) = +24 times 2 = 48 ).So, adding all these together:68 - 48sqrt{2} - 34sqrt{2} + 48.Combine like terms:68 + 48 = 116.-48sqrt{2} - 34sqrt{2} = -82sqrt{2}.So, total is 116 - 82sqrt{2}.Subtract ( sqrt{2} ): 116 - 82sqrt{2} - sqrt{2} = 116 - 83sqrt{2}.Which is definitely not equal to ( -sqrt{2} ). So, option C is incorrect.How about option A: ( frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{2} ).Compute ( f(sqrt{2}) = frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{2} times 2 - sqrt{2} = (2 - sqrt{2}) - sqrt{2} = 2 - 2sqrt{2} ).Then, compute ( f(2 - 2sqrt{2}) = frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{2} times (2 - 2sqrt{2})^2 - sqrt{2} ).First, compute ( (2 - 2sqrt{2})^2 = 4 - 8sqrt{2} + 8 = 12 - 8sqrt{2} ).So, ( f(2 - 2sqrt{2}) = frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{2} times (12 - 8sqrt{2}) - sqrt{2} ).Let me compute this:Multiply ( frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{2} times 12 = (2 - sqrt{2}) times 6 = 12 - 6sqrt{2} ).Multiply ( frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{2} times (-8sqrt{2}) = (2 - sqrt{2}) times (-4sqrt{2}) = -8sqrt{2} + 4 times 2 = -8sqrt{2} + 8 ).So, adding these together:12 - 6sqrt{2} -8sqrt{2} + 8 = (12 + 8) + (-6sqrt{2} -8sqrt{2}) = 20 -14sqrt{2}.Subtract ( sqrt{2} ): 20 -14sqrt{2} - sqrt{2} = 20 -15sqrt{2}.Which is not equal to ( -sqrt{2} ). So, option A is incorrect.Option E: ( frac{2 + sqrt{2}}{2} ).Compute ( f(sqrt{2}) = frac{2 + sqrt{2}}{2} times 2 - sqrt{2} = (2 + sqrt{2}) - sqrt{2} = 2 ).Then, compute ( f(2) = frac{2 + sqrt{2}}{2} times 4 - sqrt{2} = (2 + sqrt{2}) times 2 - sqrt{2} = 4 + 2sqrt{2} - sqrt{2} = 4 + sqrt{2} ).Which is not equal to ( -sqrt{2} ). So, option E is incorrect.So, after checking all options, only option D: ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) works. Therefore, the answer is D.But just to recap, my initial steps were:1. Compute ( f(sqrt{2}) = 2a - sqrt{2} ).2. Then, compute ( f(f(sqrt{2})) = f(2a - sqrt{2}) = a(2a - sqrt{2})^2 - sqrt{2} ).3. Expand ( (2a - sqrt{2})^2 ) to get ( 4a^2 - 4asqrt{2} + 2 ).4. Plug back into the function to get ( 4a^3 - 4a^2sqrt{2} + 2a - sqrt{2} ).5. Set equal to ( -sqrt{2} ), leading to the equation ( 4a^3 - 4a^2sqrt{2} + 2a = 0 ).6. Factor out ( 2a ) to get ( 2a(2a^2 - 2sqrt{2}a + 1) = 0 ).7. Solve for ( a ), getting ( a = 0 ) or solving the quadratic ( 2a^2 - 2sqrt{2}a + 1 = 0 ).8. The quadratic gave ( a = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), which is option D.9. Verified that this value satisfies the original condition.So, yeah, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and checking the other options didn't yield the desired result. So, I feel confident that D is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Thirteen turkey chicks were pecking grains.

I need to figure out how many grains the 10th chick pecked. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me restate the problem in my own words to make sure I understand it. There are thirteen chicks. The first one pecks 40 grains, the second one pecks 60 grains. Starting from the third chick, each chick pecks the average number of grains that all the previous chicks have pecked. So, the third chick will peck the average of the first two, the fourth chick will peck the average of the first three, and so on, up to the thirteenth chick.My goal is to find out how many grains the 10th chick pecked. So, I need to figure out the number of grains each chick from the third to the tenth pecks, based on the average of all the previous ones.Let me think about how averages work here. If each subsequent chick is pecking the average of all previous chicks, then the number of grains each chick pecks is dependent on the cumulative total up to that point. Maybe I can model this with a sequence where each term is the average of all the previous terms.Let me denote the number of grains pecked by the nth chick as ( a_n ). So, according to the problem:- ( a_1 = 40 )- ( a_2 = 60 )- For ( n geq 3 ), ( a_n = frac{a_1 + a_2 + dots + a_{n-1}}{n-1} )So, each term from the third onward is the average of all the previous terms. That seems recursive. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for ( a_n ).Let me try computing the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.We know:- ( a_1 = 40 )- ( a_2 = 60 )Now, let's compute ( a_3 ):( a_3 = frac{a_1 + a_2}{2} = frac{40 + 60}{2} = frac{100}{2} = 50 )Okay, so the third chick pecks 50 grains.Next, ( a_4 ):( a_4 = frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3}{3} = frac{40 + 60 + 50}{3} = frac{150}{3} = 50 )Hmm, interesting. The fourth chick also pecks 50 grains.Let me compute ( a_5 ):( a_5 = frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4}{4} = frac{40 + 60 + 50 + 50}{4} = frac{200}{4} = 50 )Wait, so the fifth chick also pecks 50 grains. Is this a pattern? Let me check ( a_6 ):( a_6 = frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5}{5} = frac{40 + 60 + 50 + 50 + 50}{5} = frac{250}{5} = 50 )Same result. It seems like starting from the third chick, each subsequent chick is pecking 50 grains. Is this always going to be the case?Let me test ( a_7 ):( a_7 = frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6}{6} = frac{40 + 60 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 50}{6} = frac{300}{6} = 50 )Yep, still 50. So, it seems that once we get to the third chick, every subsequent chick is pecking 50 grains. That makes me think that this is a stable average. Once the average is 50, adding another 50 doesn't change the average.Wait, let me think about that. If all the previous chicks have an average of 50, then adding another 50 keeps the average at 50. So, once the average becomes 50, all subsequent terms will also be 50. So, in this case, since ( a_3 = 50 ), and each subsequent term is the average of all previous terms, which includes 50s, the average remains 50.Therefore, from the third chick onward, each chick pecks 50 grains. So, the 10th chick, being the 8th chick after the second, would also peck 50 grains.But just to be thorough, let me compute up to the 10th chick to make sure.We have:- ( a_1 = 40 )- ( a_2 = 60 )- ( a_3 = 50 )- ( a_4 = 50 )- ( a_5 = 50 )- ( a_6 = 50 )- ( a_7 = 50 )- ( a_8 = 50 )- ( a_9 = 50 )- ( a_{10} = 50 )Yep, so each one from ( a_3 ) to ( a_{10} ) is 50 grains. Therefore, the 10th chick pecked 50 grains.But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning, let me think about the general case.Suppose we have a sequence where each term is the average of all previous terms. Let me denote ( S_n = a_1 + a_2 + dots + a_n ). Then, ( a_{n+1} = frac{S_n}{n} ). So, ( S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1} = S_n + frac{S_n}{n} = S_n left(1 + frac{1}{n}right) = S_n cdot frac{n+1}{n} ).Therefore, ( S_{n+1} = frac{n+1}{n} S_n ). This is a recursive relation for ( S_n ). Let me try to solve this recurrence relation.We can write:( S_{n+1} = frac{n+1}{n} S_n )This is a telescoping product. Let's compute ( S_n ) in terms of ( S_1 ).Starting from ( S_1 = a_1 = 40 ).Then,( S_2 = S_1 + a_2 = 40 + 60 = 100 )( S_3 = frac{3}{2} S_2 = frac{3}{2} times 100 = 150 )( S_4 = frac{4}{3} S_3 = frac{4}{3} times 150 = 200 )( S_5 = frac{5}{4} S_4 = frac{5}{4} times 200 = 250 )( S_6 = frac{6}{5} S_5 = frac{6}{5} times 250 = 300 )( S_7 = frac{7}{6} S_6 = frac{7}{6} times 300 = 350 )( S_8 = frac{8}{7} S_7 = frac{8}{7} times 350 = 400 )( S_9 = frac{9}{8} S_8 = frac{9}{8} times 400 = 450 )( S_{10} = frac{10}{9} S_9 = frac{10}{9} times 450 = 500 )Wait, so ( S_{10} = 500 ). But ( a_{10} = S_{10} - S_9 = 500 - 450 = 50 ). So, that confirms it. The 10th chick pecked 50 grains.But let me see if there's a general formula for ( S_n ). From the recurrence relation:( S_{n+1} = frac{n+1}{n} S_n )This can be written as:( S_{n} = S_1 times prod_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{k+1}{k} )Because each step multiplies by ( frac{k+1}{k} ) for ( k ) from 1 to ( n-1 ).Simplifying the product:( prod_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{k+1}{k} = frac{2}{1} times frac{3}{2} times frac{4}{3} times dots times frac{n}{n-1} = frac{n}{1} = n )So, ( S_n = S_1 times n ). But wait, ( S_1 = 40 ), so ( S_n = 40n ). But wait, that can't be right because when n=2, S_2=100, but 40*2=80. That's a contradiction.Wait, so my general formula must be wrong. Let me check.Wait, starting from ( S_1 = 40 ), then ( S_2 = 40 + 60 = 100 ). Then, ( S_3 = frac{3}{2} times 100 = 150 ), ( S_4 = frac{4}{3} times 150 = 200 ), ( S_5 = frac{5}{4} times 200 = 250 ), and so on.So, the product telescopes to ( S_n = S_2 times prod_{k=3}^{n} frac{k}{k-1} ). Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices.Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that starting from ( S_2 ), each subsequent ( S_n ) is ( S_{n-1} times frac{n}{n-1} ). So, starting from ( S_2 = 100 ), then:( S_3 = 100 times frac{3}{2} = 150 )( S_4 = 150 times frac{4}{3} = 200 )( S_5 = 200 times frac{5}{4} = 250 )And so on, so in general, ( S_n = 100 times frac{n}{2} ) for ( n geq 2 ). Wait, let's test that.For ( n=2 ): ( S_2 = 100 times frac{2}{2} = 100 ) Correct.For ( n=3 ): ( S_3 = 100 times frac{3}{2} = 150 ) Correct.For ( n=4 ): ( S_4 = 100 times frac{4}{2} = 200 ) Correct.Wait, so actually, ( S_n = 100 times frac{n}{2} = 50n ). So, ( S_n = 50n ). Let me check for ( n=5 ): ( S_5 = 50 times 5 = 250 ). Correct.So, indeed, ( S_n = 50n ) for ( n geq 2 ). Therefore, the total grains after n chicks is 50n.Therefore, the nth chick pecks ( a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = 50n - 50(n-1) = 50 ) grains for ( n geq 2 ). Wait, but ( a_2 = 60 ), which contradicts this. Hmm, so maybe my general formula is only valid for ( n geq 3 ).Wait, let's see. For ( n=3 ): ( a_3 = 50 ), which is correct.For ( n=4 ): ( a_4 = 50 ), correct.So, starting from ( n=3 ), ( a_n = 50 ). So, the formula ( S_n = 50n ) is valid for ( n geq 2 ), but ( a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = 50n - 50(n-1) = 50 ) for ( n geq 3 ). So, that works.But for ( n=2 ), ( a_2 = 60 ), which is different. So, the formula ( a_n = 50 ) holds for ( n geq 3 ).Therefore, for the 10th chick, ( a_{10} = 50 ).So, after all that, the 10th chick pecked 50 grains.I think that's solid. I computed the first few terms, noticed the pattern, then tried to generalize it using the recurrence relation for the cumulative sum, which led me to the conclusion that the total grains after n chicks is 50n for n ≥ 2, which means each subsequent chick pecks 50 grains. So, the 10th chick is no exception and pecks 50 grains.**Final Answer**The 10th chick pecked boxed{50} grains."},{"question":"Given a geometric sequence {a_n}, where a_4=7 and a_6=21, find the value of a_8.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me make sure I remember what a geometric sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, right? So, if I denote the first term as ( a_1 ) and the common ratio as ( r ), then the nth term of the sequence can be written as ( a_n = a_1 times r^{n-1} ). The problem gives me two specific terms: ( a_4 = 7 ) and ( a_6 = 21 ). I need to find ( a_8 ). Hmm, okay, so let's write down what these terms mean in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( r ).For ( a_4 ), that would be ( a_1 times r^{3} = 7 ). And for ( a_6 ), it's ( a_1 times r^{5} = 21 ). So I have two equations:1. ( a_1 r^3 = 7 )2. ( a_1 r^5 = 21 )I need to find ( a_8 ), which would be ( a_1 times r^{7} ). So, if I can find ( a_1 ) and ( r ), I can compute ( a_8 ). Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between ( a_4 ) and ( a_6 ) to find ( r ) first, and then work from there.Let me see. If I divide the second equation by the first, that might eliminate ( a_1 ). Let's try that:( frac{a_1 r^5}{a_1 r^3} = frac{21}{7} )Simplifying the left side, ( a_1 ) cancels out, and ( r^5 / r^3 = r^{2} ). On the right side, 21 divided by 7 is 3. So, ( r^2 = 3 ). Therefore, ( r = sqrt{3} ) or ( r = -sqrt{3} ). Hmm, so the common ratio could be positive or negative. I should keep that in mind.Now, let's go back to the first equation to find ( a_1 ). Using ( a_1 r^3 = 7 ). If ( r^2 = 3 ), then ( r^3 = r times r^2 = r times 3 = 3r ). So, substituting back into the equation:( a_1 times 3r = 7 )So, ( a_1 = frac{7}{3r} ). But we don't know the value of ( r ) yet, only that ( r^2 = 3 ). So ( r ) could be ( sqrt{3} ) or ( -sqrt{3} ). Let's consider both cases.Case 1: ( r = sqrt{3} )Then, ( a_1 = frac{7}{3 times sqrt{3}} ). Let me rationalize the denominator:( a_1 = frac{7}{3sqrt{3}} times frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} = frac{7sqrt{3}}{9} )Case 2: ( r = -sqrt{3} )Then, ( a_1 = frac{7}{3 times (-sqrt{3})} = -frac{7}{3sqrt{3}} ). Again, rationalizing:( a_1 = -frac{7}{3sqrt{3}} times frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} = -frac{7sqrt{3}}{9} )So, depending on whether ( r ) is positive or negative, ( a_1 ) is positive or negative. But since the problem doesn't specify whether the sequence is increasing or decreasing, or any other terms, both possibilities are valid. However, when we compute ( a_8 ), we might end up with the same result regardless of the sign of ( r ). Let me check that.First, let's compute ( a_8 ) in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( r ). ( a_8 = a_1 r^7 ). Let's express ( r^7 ) in terms of ( r^2 = 3 ). Since ( r^2 = 3 ), ( r^4 = (r^2)^2 = 9 ), ( r^6 = (r^2)^3 = 27 ), so ( r^7 = r^6 times r = 27r ).Therefore, ( a_8 = a_1 times 27r ). But from earlier, we have ( a_1 = frac{7}{3r} ). So substituting that in:( a_8 = frac{7}{3r} times 27r )Simplify this expression. The ( r ) in the denominator and the ( r ) in the numerator cancel out, and 27 divided by 3 is 9. So, ( a_8 = 7 times 9 = 63 ).Wait, so regardless of whether ( r ) is positive or negative, ( a_8 ) is 63? Let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with negative ratios, the signs can flip, but in this case, since ( r^7 ) is multiplied by ( a_1 ), which also has a negative sign if ( r ) is negative, they might cancel out.Let me test with both cases.Case 1: ( r = sqrt{3} ), ( a_1 = frac{7sqrt{3}}{9} )Compute ( a_8 = a_1 r^7 = frac{7sqrt{3}}{9} times (sqrt{3})^7 )First, compute ( (sqrt{3})^7 ). Since ( (sqrt{3})^2 = 3 ), so ( (sqrt{3})^7 = (sqrt{3})^{6} times (sqrt{3}) = (3^3) times sqrt{3} = 27 sqrt{3} )So, ( a_8 = frac{7sqrt{3}}{9} times 27 sqrt{3} )Multiply the constants: ( frac{7}{9} times 27 = 7 times 3 = 21 )Multiply the radicals: ( sqrt{3} times sqrt{3} = 3 )So, ( a_8 = 21 times 3 = 63 )Case 2: ( r = -sqrt{3} ), ( a_1 = -frac{7sqrt{3}}{9} )Compute ( a_8 = a_1 r^7 = -frac{7sqrt{3}}{9} times (-sqrt{3})^7 )First, compute ( (-sqrt{3})^7 ). Since 7 is odd, this is equal to ( -(sqrt{3})^7 = -27 sqrt{3} ) as before.So, ( a_8 = -frac{7sqrt{3}}{9} times (-27 sqrt{3}) )Multiply the constants: ( -frac{7}{9} times (-27) = frac{7}{9} times 27 = 7 times 3 = 21 )Multiply the radicals: ( sqrt{3} times sqrt{3} = 3 )So, ( a_8 = 21 times 3 = 63 )So, in both cases, whether ( r ) is positive or negative, ( a_8 = 63 ). Therefore, the value of ( a_8 ) is 63.Alternatively, another approach is to recognize that in a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. So, between ( a_4 ) and ( a_6 ), there are two intervals, each multiplied by ( r ). So, ( a_6 = a_4 times r^2 ). Therefore, ( 21 = 7 times r^2 ), which gives ( r^2 = 3 ), same as before. Then, to find ( a_8 ), which is two more terms after ( a_6 ), so ( a_8 = a_6 times r^2 = 21 times 3 = 63 ). That's a quicker way without having to compute ( a_1 ).So, either way, the answer is 63.**Final Answer**The value of ( a_8 ) is boxed{63}."},{"question":"Can the integers from 1 to 2004 be arranged in such a way that the sum of every ten consecutive numbers is divisible by 10?","answer":"Alright, so I came across this interesting problem: \\"Can the integers from 1 to 2004 be arranged in such a way that the sum of every ten consecutive numbers is divisible by 10?\\" At first glance, it seems a bit tricky, but I think I can break it down step by step.First, let me understand the problem clearly. We need to arrange the numbers 1 through 2004 in a sequence. The key condition is that if you take any ten consecutive numbers from this sequence, their sum should be divisible by 10. So, for example, the sum of the first ten numbers should be divisible by 10, the sum of numbers 2 to 11 should also be divisible by 10, and so on, all the way up to the sum of numbers 1995 to 2004.Hmm, okay. So, the challenge is to find such an arrangement or prove that it's impossible. Let me think about the properties that such an arrangement must satisfy.Let's denote the sequence as ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{2004} ). The condition is that for every ( i ) from 1 to 1995, the sum ( S_i = a_i + a_{i+1} + ldots + a_{i+9} ) is divisible by 10. That is, ( S_i equiv 0 mod 10 ).Now, let's consider the relationship between consecutive sums. For example, ( S_{i+1} = a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + ldots + a_{i+10} ). Notice that ( S_{i+1} = S_i - a_i + a_{i+10} ). Since both ( S_i ) and ( S_{i+1} ) are divisible by 10, their difference ( S_{i+1} - S_i = a_{i+10} - a_i ) must also be divisible by 10. Therefore, ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ).This is a crucial observation. It tells us that the sequence must satisfy ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ) for all ( i ) from 1 to 1994. In other words, the sequence must be periodic modulo 10 with a period of 10. That is, the residues of the numbers modulo 10 must repeat every 10 terms.So, if we can arrange the numbers such that every 10th term has the same residue modulo 10, then the condition will be satisfied. Let me think about how this could be achieved.Given that we have numbers from 1 to 2004, each number has a residue modulo 10, which can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 9. Let's count how many numbers there are for each residue.Total numbers: 2004.Numbers congruent to ( r mod 10 ) where ( r = 0,1,2,...,9 ):- For ( r = 1 ) to ( r = 9 ): Each residue occurs ( lfloor frac{2004}{10} rfloor ) or ( lfloor frac{2004}{10} rfloor + 1 ) times.Calculating ( frac{2004}{10} = 200.4 ). So, each residue from 1 to 9 occurs 200 times, and the residue 0 occurs 200 times as well because 2004 is divisible by 4 but not by 10. Wait, 2004 divided by 10 is 200.4, so actually, residues 1 through 4 will have 201 numbers each, and residues 5 through 0 will have 200 each? Wait, let me verify.Wait, 2004 divided by 10 is 200 with a remainder of 4. So, the residues 1, 2, 3, 4 will each have 201 numbers, and residues 5 through 0 will have 200 each. Let me confirm:Numbers from 1 to 2004:- Numbers congruent to 1 mod 10: 1, 11, 21, ..., 2001. That's (2001 - 1)/10 + 1 = 200 + 1 = 201 numbers.Similarly, for 2 mod 10: 2, 12, ..., 2002. That's also 201 numbers.Same for 3, 4 mod 10: 201 each.For 5 mod 10: 5, 15, ..., 2005. Wait, 2005 is beyond 2004, so the last number is 2000. So, 5, 15, ..., 2000. That's (2000 - 5)/10 + 1 = 199.5 + 1 = 200.5, which is not an integer. Wait, that can't be. Wait, 2000 is the last number, so starting at 5, each step of 10: 5,15,25,...,2000. The number of terms is (2000 - 5)/10 + 1 = 199.5 + 1 = 200.5? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, actually, (2000 - 5)/10 is 199.5, but since we can't have half terms, it's actually 200 terms because 5 + 10*(n-1) = 2000 => n = (2000 - 5)/10 + 1 = 199.5 + 1 = 200.5, but since n must be integer, it's 200 terms.Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 2004, how many numbers are congruent to 5 mod 10? The first is 5, the last less than or equal to 2004 is 2000. The count is ((2000 - 5)/10) + 1 = (1995)/10 + 1 = 199.5 + 1 = 200.5. Hmm, that's still not an integer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.Wait, 5,15,25,...,2000. Let's see: 5 + 10*(n-1) = 2000 => 10*(n-1) = 1995 => n-1 = 199.5 => n = 200.5. That's not possible. So, actually, the last term is 1995, which is 5 + 10*(199) = 1995. Then, 1995 + 10 = 2005, which is beyond 2004. So, the count is 200 terms for residue 5.Wait, but 5 + 10*199 = 5 + 1990 = 1995. So, 1995 is the 200th term. Then, 2005 would be the 201st, which is beyond 2004. So, yes, residue 5 has 200 numbers.Similarly, residues 6,7,8,9,0: Each will have 200 numbers as well.Wait, let's check residue 0: numbers divisible by 10: 10,20,...,2000. That's 200 numbers.Residues 1-4: 201 each, residues 5-0: 200 each.So, in total: 4*201 + 6*200 = 804 + 1200 = 2004. Correct.So, residues 1-4: 201 numbers each.Residues 5-0: 200 numbers each.Now, going back to the problem. We need to arrange the numbers such that every 10th term is congruent modulo 10. That is, the sequence is periodic modulo 10 with period 10.Therefore, in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, each residue from 0 to 9 must appear exactly once. Because if the sequence is periodic modulo 10 with period 10, then in each block of 10, the residues must cycle through 0-9 in some order.Wait, is that necessarily true? Or can they repeat?Wait, no, because if it's periodic with period 10, then the residues would repeat every 10 terms. So, for example, the first term is r1, the 11th term is r1, the 21st term is r1, etc. So, each residue class must be equally distributed in the sequence.But in our case, residues 1-4 have 201 numbers each, and residues 5-0 have 200 each. So, if we have a period of 10, each residue would need to appear the same number of times in each block of 10. But since 2004 is not a multiple of 10, the total number of blocks is 200.4, which is not an integer. Wait, actually, 2004 divided by 10 is 200.4, so there are 200 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 4.Wait, but in our earlier reasoning, we saw that the sequence must be periodic modulo 10 with period 10. So, the entire sequence would have a repeating pattern every 10 terms. Therefore, the number of times each residue appears in the entire sequence must be equal, or differ by at most one.But in our case, residues 1-4 appear 201 times, and residues 5-0 appear 200 times. So, each residue appears either 200 or 201 times.If the sequence is periodic with period 10, then each residue must appear exactly the same number of times in each period. Since the total number of periods is 200 full periods (each of 10 terms) and a partial period of 4 terms.Wait, so in 200 full periods, each residue would appear 200 times. Then, in the partial period of 4 terms, we have 4 more residues. So, the total counts would be 200 + 1 for the residues that appear in the partial period, making them 201, and 200 for the others.But in our case, residues 1-4 have 201 each, and 5-0 have 200 each. So, if the partial period includes residues 1-4, then that would make sense. So, the first 200*10=2000 terms form 200 full periods, each with residues 0-9 exactly once. Then, the last 4 terms would be the first 4 residues of the next period, which would be residues 1-4, each appearing once more, making their total count 201.Therefore, it seems possible to arrange the numbers in such a way that the sequence is periodic modulo 10 with period 10, and the last 4 terms are the first 4 residues of the next period.But wait, does this arrangement satisfy the condition that every ten consecutive numbers sum to a multiple of 10?Let me think. If the sequence is periodic modulo 10 with period 10, then in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, the residues are 0-9 in some order. Therefore, the sum of any ten consecutive numbers would be the sum of residues 0-9, which is 45, and 45 mod 10 is 5. Wait, that's a problem because 45 is not divisible by 10.Wait, hold on. If each block of 10 consecutive numbers has residues summing to 45, which is 5 mod 10, then the sum would not be divisible by 10. That contradicts our earlier conclusion.Hmm, so my initial reasoning might be flawed. Let me re-examine.I concluded that the sequence must be periodic modulo 10 with period 10 because ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ). However, if that's the case, then each block of 10 consecutive numbers would have the same residues as the first block, just shifted. Therefore, the sum of each block would be the same, which is 45 mod 10, which is 5. Therefore, the sum would not be divisible by 10.But the problem requires that every ten consecutive numbers sum to a multiple of 10. So, my initial conclusion that the sequence must be periodic modulo 10 with period 10 leads to a contradiction because the sum would be 45 mod 10, which is 5, not 0.Therefore, my earlier reasoning must be incorrect. Let me think again.Wait, perhaps the sequence doesn't have to be periodic modulo 10, but rather, the difference ( a_{i+10} - a_i ) must be divisible by 10. So, ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ). That is, each term is congruent modulo 10 to the term 10 places before it.This doesn't necessarily mean that the entire sequence is periodic modulo 10 with period 10. Instead, it means that the residues repeat every 10 terms, but the actual values can differ by multiples of 10.So, for example, ( a_1 equiv a_{11} equiv a_{21} equiv ldots mod 10 ), ( a_2 equiv a_{12} equiv a_{22} equiv ldots mod 10 ), and so on.Therefore, the sequence is composed of 10 interleaved arithmetic sequences, each with a common difference of 10. Each of these sequences must contain numbers that are congruent modulo 10.Given that, we can think of the sequence as 10 separate sequences, each handling one residue class modulo 10. Each of these sequences must be arranged in such a way that when combined, every ten consecutive numbers sum to a multiple of 10.Wait, but how does that help? Let me think.If we have 10 separate sequences, each handling a residue class, then the entire sequence is formed by taking one term from each residue sequence in order. So, the first term is from residue 1, the second from residue 2, ..., the tenth from residue 0, then the eleventh from residue 1 again, and so on.But in that case, the sum of any ten consecutive numbers would be the sum of one number from each residue class. Since each residue class contributes exactly one number to the sum, the total sum modulo 10 would be the sum of residues 1 through 0, which is 45, as before, which is 5 mod 10. Therefore, the sum would not be divisible by 10.This is a problem. So, arranging the numbers in such a way that each residue class is evenly distributed every 10 terms leads to the sum of ten consecutive numbers being 45 mod 10, which is 5, not 0.Therefore, this approach doesn't work. So, perhaps the initial assumption that ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ) is necessary but not sufficient?Wait, let me think again. The condition is that ( S_i equiv 0 mod 10 ) for all ( i ). We derived that ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ). So, that condition is necessary. But is it sufficient?No, because even if ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ), the sum of ten consecutive numbers could still not be 0 mod 10, as we saw earlier.Therefore, we need an additional condition. Maybe the sum of the residues in each block of ten must be 0 mod 10. But since each block of ten consecutive numbers includes one number from each residue class, their sum is 45 mod 10, which is 5. Therefore, unless we can adjust the residues somehow, this won't work.Wait, but the problem is that the sum of residues 0-9 is 45, which is 5 mod 10. So, unless we can make the sum of each block of ten numbers to be 0 mod 10, which would require that the sum of residues in each block is 0 mod 10. But since each block must include one of each residue, the sum is fixed at 45 mod 10, which is 5.Therefore, it's impossible to have the sum of ten consecutive numbers be 0 mod 10 if each block must contain one of each residue. Therefore, such an arrangement is impossible.Wait, but hold on. Maybe the blocks don't have to contain one of each residue? Maybe the residues can be arranged in such a way that the sum of any ten consecutive numbers is 0 mod 10, even if the residues aren't all distinct in each block.But earlier, we saw that ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ). So, the residues repeat every 10 terms. Therefore, in each block of ten consecutive numbers, the residues are the same as the first ten residues, just shifted. Therefore, the sum of residues in each block is the same, which is 45 mod 10 = 5. Therefore, the sum cannot be 0 mod 10.Therefore, it's impossible to arrange the numbers from 1 to 2004 in such a way that every ten consecutive numbers sum to a multiple of 10.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a wrong assumption somewhere.We have that ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ). So, the residues repeat every 10 terms. Therefore, the entire sequence is composed of 10 interleaved arithmetic sequences, each with difference 10, and each handling one residue class.Therefore, the sum of any ten consecutive numbers would be the sum of one term from each residue class. Since each residue class contributes exactly one number, the sum of residues is 45, which is 5 mod 10. Therefore, the sum cannot be 0 mod 10.Therefore, it's impossible.But wait, let me check the total sum of all numbers from 1 to 2004. The total sum is ( frac{2004 times 2005}{2} = 1002 times 2005 = 2007010 ). The sum of all numbers is 2007010.Now, if we consider the sum of all overlapping ten-term blocks, how does that relate to the total sum?Each number from 1 to 2004 is included in exactly 10 blocks, except for the first 9 and the last 9 numbers, which are included in fewer blocks. Wait, actually, for the sequence of 2004 numbers, the number of ten-term blocks is 2004 - 10 + 1 = 1995.Each number is included in 10 blocks except for the first 9 and the last 9 numbers. Specifically, the first number is only in the first block, the second number is in the first and second blocks, ..., the tenth number is in the first ten blocks. Similarly, the 1995th number is in the last ten blocks, and so on.Wait, actually, each number from position 10 to 1995 is included in exactly 10 blocks. The numbers from 1 to 9 are included in 1 to 9 blocks, and the numbers from 1996 to 2004 are included in 1 to 9 blocks.But regardless, the total sum of all blocks is equal to the sum of all numbers multiplied by the number of blocks they appear in. However, since each block sums to a multiple of 10, the total sum of all blocks is a multiple of 10.But let's calculate the total sum of all blocks. Each block has a sum divisible by 10, so the total sum is divisible by 10.On the other hand, the total sum of all blocks can also be expressed as the sum of each number multiplied by the number of blocks it appears in.Let me denote ( T ) as the total sum of all blocks. Then,( T = sum_{i=1}^{2004} a_i times c_i ),where ( c_i ) is the number of blocks that include ( a_i ).As mentioned earlier, ( c_i = 10 ) for ( i = 10, 11, ldots, 1995 ), and ( c_i = i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 9 ), and ( c_i = 2004 - i + 1 ) for ( i = 1996, ldots, 2004 ).Therefore,( T = sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i + sum_{i=10}^{1995} a_i times 10 + sum_{i=1996}^{2004} a_i times (2004 - i + 1) ).But since each block sum is divisible by 10, ( T ) must be divisible by 10.Now, let's compute ( T ) modulo 10.First, note that ( sum_{i=1}^{2004} a_i = 2007010 ), which is 0 mod 10 because 2007010 ends with a 0.Now, ( T = sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i + 10 times sum_{i=10}^{1995} a_i + sum_{i=1996}^{2004} a_i times (2004 - i + 1) ).Since 10 times anything is 0 mod 10, the middle term is 0 mod 10. Therefore,( T equiv sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i + sum_{i=1996}^{2004} a_i times (2004 - i + 1) mod 10 ).But ( T ) must be 0 mod 10, so( sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i + sum_{i=1996}^{2004} a_i times (2004 - i + 1) equiv 0 mod 10 ).Let me denote the first sum as ( S_1 = sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i ) and the second sum as ( S_2 = sum_{i=1996}^{2004} a_i times (2004 - i + 1) ).Note that ( 2004 - i + 1 = 2005 - i ). So, for ( i = 1996 ), it's ( 2005 - 1996 = 9 ); for ( i = 1997 ), it's 8; ..., for ( i = 2004 ), it's 1. So, ( S_2 = sum_{k=1}^{9} a_{2005 - k} times k ).Therefore, ( S_2 = sum_{k=1}^{9} a_{2005 - k} times k ).But notice that ( a_{2005 - k} ) is the term at position ( 2005 - k ), which is the same as the term at position ( 2005 - k ) from the start. However, in the sequence, the term at position ( 2005 - k ) is the same as the term at position ( k ) from the end.Wait, but in our earlier consideration, we have that ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ). Therefore, the residues repeat every 10 terms. So, the residue of ( a_{2005 - k} ) is the same as the residue of ( a_{2005 - k - 10 times m} ), where ( m ) is such that ( 2005 - k - 10 times m ) is between 1 and 10.But 2005 is 1 mod 10 (since 2005 = 200*10 + 5, wait no, 2005 = 200*10 + 5, so 2005 mod 10 is 5. Wait, 2005 - k mod 10 is (5 - k) mod 10.But ( a_{2005 - k} equiv a_{(2005 - k) mod 10} mod 10 ). Wait, no, because ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ), so ( a_j equiv a_{j mod 10} mod 10 ). But ( j mod 10 ) is the position in the first 10 terms.Wait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let me think differently.Since ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ), the residues of the sequence are periodic with period 10. Therefore, the residues of the first 10 terms determine the residues of the entire sequence.Therefore, the residues of the last 9 terms (positions 1996 to 2004) are the same as the residues of the first 9 terms (positions 1 to 9). Because 1996 mod 10 = 6, so ( a_{1996} equiv a_6 mod 10 ), ( a_{1997} equiv a_7 mod 10 ), ..., ( a_{2004} equiv a_4 mod 10 ).Wait, let me check: 1996 divided by 10 is 199.6, so 1996 = 10*199 + 6, so ( a_{1996} equiv a_6 mod 10 ). Similarly, 1997 = 10*199 +7, so ( a_{1997} equiv a_7 mod 10 ), and so on until 2004 = 10*200 +4, so ( a_{2004} equiv a_4 mod 10 ).Therefore, the residues of the last 9 terms are the same as residues 6 through 4 of the first 10 terms.Therefore, ( S_2 = sum_{k=1}^{9} a_{2005 - k} times k equiv sum_{k=1}^{9} a_{(2005 - k) mod 10} times k mod 10 ).But ( 2005 - k mod 10 = (5 - k) mod 10 ). So, for k=1, it's 4; k=2, 3; k=3, 2; k=4,1; k=5,0; k=6,9; k=7,8; k=8,7; k=9,6.Therefore, ( S_2 equiv a_4 times 1 + a_3 times 2 + a_2 times 3 + a_1 times 4 + a_{10} times 5 + a_9 times 6 + a_8 times 7 + a_7 times 8 + a_6 times 9 mod 10 ).Similarly, ( S_1 = sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i ).Therefore, ( S_1 + S_2 equiv sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i + sum_{k=1}^{9} a_{(5 - k) mod 10} times k mod 10 ).Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.Alternatively, since the residues of the last 9 terms are the same as the residues of the first 9 terms shifted by some amount, perhaps we can pair terms in ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) such that their contributions cancel out modulo 10.But I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider specific values.Wait, let's consider the residues of the first 10 terms. Let me denote them as ( r_1, r_2, ..., r_{10} ), where each ( r_i ) is the residue of ( a_i ) modulo 10.Since the sequence is periodic modulo 10, the residues repeat every 10 terms. Therefore, the residues of the entire sequence are ( r_1, r_2, ..., r_{10}, r_1, r_2, ..., r_{10}, ..., r_1, r_2, ..., r_4 ).Now, the sum of any ten consecutive residues is ( r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_{10} equiv 45 mod 10 equiv 5 mod 10 ). Therefore, the sum of ten consecutive numbers is 5 mod 10, which is not 0. Therefore, it's impossible for the sum to be divisible by 10.Wait, but this contradicts our earlier conclusion that ( T ) must be 0 mod 10. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, no. The total sum ( T ) is the sum of all blocks, each of which is 0 mod 10. Therefore, ( T equiv 0 mod 10 ). However, we also have that ( T equiv S_1 + S_2 mod 10 ), which must be 0. But from the residue perspective, ( S_1 + S_2 equiv ) something, which might not necessarily be 0.Wait, perhaps I need to consider the actual values, not just the residues.Wait, let me think differently. The sum of each ten-term block is divisible by 10. Therefore, each block sum is 10 times some integer. The total sum ( T ) is the sum of all these block sums, which is 10 times the sum of those integers. Therefore, ( T ) is divisible by 10.But ( T ) is also equal to the sum of each number multiplied by the number of blocks it appears in. As we saw earlier, except for the first 9 and last 9 numbers, each number appears in 10 blocks. Therefore, ( T = 10 times sum_{i=10}^{1995} a_i + sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i + sum_{i=1996}^{2004} a_i times (2004 - i + 1) ).Since ( T ) is divisible by 10, the terms ( sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i + sum_{i=1996}^{2004} a_i times (2004 - i + 1) ) must also be divisible by 10.But from the residue perspective, the sum of residues in each block is 5 mod 10, so the total sum of all blocks is 1995 blocks * 5 mod 10 = (1995 mod 2) * 5 mod 10. Since 1995 is odd, 1995 mod 2 =1, so total sum mod 10 is 5. But earlier, we saw that ( T ) must be 0 mod 10. Therefore, 5 ≡ 0 mod 10, which is a contradiction.Therefore, such an arrangement is impossible.Wait, that's a solid argument. Let me recap:1. If such an arrangement exists, then each ten-term block sums to 0 mod 10.2. The total sum ( T ) of all blocks is 1995 * (sum of a ten-term block).3. Since each ten-term block sum is 0 mod 10, ( T ) is 0 mod 10.4. However, calculating ( T ) as the sum of each number multiplied by the number of blocks it appears in, we find that ( T equiv 5 mod 10 ), which is a contradiction.5. Therefore, such an arrangement is impossible.Therefore, the answer is no, it's not possible to arrange the integers from 1 to 2004 in such a way that the sum of every ten consecutive numbers is divisible by 10.But wait, let me double-check my reasoning about the total sum modulo 10.Each ten-term block sum is 0 mod 10, so ( T = 1995 times 0 = 0 mod 10 ).But when calculating ( T ) as the sum of each number multiplied by its count in blocks, we have:( T = 10 times sum_{i=10}^{1995} a_i + sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i + sum_{i=1996}^{2004} a_i times (2004 - i + 1) ).Since ( 10 times sum ) is 0 mod 10, the remaining terms must also sum to 0 mod 10.But earlier, I thought that the sum of residues in each block is 5 mod 10, leading to ( T equiv 5 mod 10 ). But wait, that's not correct because the actual sum of each block is 0 mod 10, not 5 mod 10. So, my earlier conclusion was wrong.Wait, I'm confused now. Let me clarify.If each block sum is 0 mod 10, then the total sum ( T ) is 0 mod 10. However, when calculating ( T ) as the sum of each number multiplied by its count in blocks, we have:( T = 10 times sum_{i=10}^{1995} a_i + sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i + sum_{i=1996}^{2004} a_i times (2004 - i + 1) ).Since ( 10 times sum ) is 0 mod 10, the remaining terms must sum to 0 mod 10. Therefore,( sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i + sum_{i=1996}^{2004} a_i times (2004 - i + 1) equiv 0 mod 10 ).But earlier, I tried to compute this sum modulo 10 using residues and found that it's 5 mod 10, leading to a contradiction. However, that approach might have been flawed because the actual sums are not just residues but actual numbers.Wait, perhaps I should consider the actual values instead of residues. Let me denote ( S = sum_{i=1}^{9} a_i times i + sum_{i=1996}^{2004} a_i times (2004 - i + 1) ).We know that ( S equiv 0 mod 10 ).But from the earlier residue analysis, we saw that the sum of residues in each block is 5 mod 10, which would imply that the total sum ( T ) is 5 mod 10, contradicting ( T equiv 0 mod 10 ). However, this is only true if the sum of residues in each block is 5 mod 10, which is not necessarily the case because the actual sums are multiples of 10, not just 5 mod 10.Wait, no. The sum of each block is a multiple of 10, so the sum of residues in each block must be 0 mod 10. But earlier, I thought that the sum of residues in each block is 45 mod 10 = 5, which would imply that the sum of each block is 5 mod 10, which contradicts the requirement that it's 0 mod 10.Therefore, the only way for the sum of each block to be 0 mod 10 is if the sum of residues in each block is 0 mod 10. But since each block contains one of each residue, the sum is 45 mod 10 = 5, which is not 0. Therefore, it's impossible.Therefore, such an arrangement is impossible.Wait, but this seems to be a solid conclusion. Let me try to formalize it.Given that the sequence must satisfy ( a_{i+10} equiv a_i mod 10 ), the residues are periodic with period 10. Therefore, each block of ten consecutive numbers contains exactly one number from each residue class 0-9. The sum of residues 0-9 is 45, which is 5 mod 10. Therefore, the sum of each block is 5 mod 10, which cannot be 0 mod 10. Therefore, it's impossible to arrange the numbers as required.Therefore, the answer is no, it's not possible."},{"question":"If the intended number is multiplied by 6, then 382 is added to the product, the result is the largest three-digit number written with two identical even digits and one odd digit.

However, I must check if this satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Adding 4 and 4 gives 8, which is not greater than 8. Therefore, this combination does not form a valid triangle.Next, I examine the scenario where the two equal sides are both 8 units long.

This means that each of them is between 0 and 1, not including 1.Next, I consider the product ( A times B ). Since both ( A ) and ( B ) are less than 1, their product will also be less than 1. For example, if ( A = 0.5 ) and ( B = 0.5 ), then ( A times B = 0.25 ).Adding 0.1 to this product, the expression becomes ( A times B + 0.1 ). Using the same example, ( 0.25 + 0.1 = 0.35 ), which is still less than 1.To explore the maximum possible value of the expression, I assume ( A ) and ( B ) are as close to 1 as possible, say ( A = 0.99 ) and ( B = 0.99 ).

Each time a ball is drawn from the bag, its color is recorded and the ball is returned to the bag. This process continues until two consecutive red balls are drawn. Let zeta be the total number of draws. If the probability of drawing a ball of any color is the same each time, what is the expected value of zeta?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a bag with four balls: red, yellow, blue, and green. Each time I draw a ball, I note its color and put it back in the bag. I keep doing this until I draw two red balls in a row. The question is asking for the expected number of draws, which is denoted by ζ. Hmm, okay.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Each draw is independent because after each draw, the ball is returned to the bag. So the probability of drawing any color remains the same each time. Since there are four balls, the probability of drawing red is 1/4, and the probability of drawing any other color is 3/4.The process stops when I get two reds in a row. So, I need to find the expected number of draws until this happens. I think this is a problem that can be modeled using states and maybe recursion. Let me try to break it down.Let me define some states based on the recent history of draws. Since we're looking for two consecutive reds, the state can be defined by how many consecutive reds we've drawn so far. So, we can have two states:1. State S0: No reds drawn recently or the last draw was not red.2. State S1: One red has been drawn, so we're one step closer to stopping.Our goal is to find the expected number of draws starting from S0 until we reach two consecutive reds, which would be our stopping point.Let me denote E0 as the expected number of draws starting from S0, and E1 as the expected number starting from S1.So, from S0, when we draw a ball, there are two possibilities:- We draw a red ball (probability 1/4). Then we move to state S1.- We draw a non-red ball (probability 3/4). Then we stay in state S0.Similarly, from S1, when we draw a ball:- If we draw a red ball (probability 1/4), we've achieved two consecutive reds, so we stop. That means the process ends, and we don't need to draw anymore.- If we draw a non-red ball (probability 3/4), we go back to state S0 because the last draw wasn't red.So, we can write equations for E0 and E1 based on these transitions.Starting with E0:From S0, we make one draw, which takes us to either S1 or remains in S0. So, the expected number of draws E0 is 1 (for the current draw) plus the expected number from the next state.Mathematically, that would be:E0 = 1 + (1/4)*E1 + (3/4)*E0Similarly, for E1:From S1, we make one draw, which either ends the process or sends us back to S0. So, the expected number of draws E1 is 1 (for the current draw) plus the expected number from the next state.Mathematically:E1 = 1 + (1/4)*0 + (3/4)*E0Because if we draw red (1/4), we stop, so the expected additional draws are 0. If we draw non-red (3/4), we go back to S0, so we add E0.So, now we have two equations:1. E0 = 1 + (1/4)E1 + (3/4)E02. E1 = 1 + (3/4)E0Let me solve these equations step by step.Starting with equation 1:E0 = 1 + (1/4)E1 + (3/4)E0Let me subtract (3/4)E0 from both sides to get:E0 - (3/4)E0 = 1 + (1/4)E1Which simplifies to:(1/4)E0 = 1 + (1/4)E1Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fractions:E0 = 4 + E1So, equation 1 simplifies to E0 = E1 + 4.Now, let's look at equation 2:E1 = 1 + (3/4)E0We can substitute E0 from equation 1 into this equation.Since E0 = E1 + 4, substitute into equation 2:E1 = 1 + (3/4)(E1 + 4)Let me expand the right-hand side:E1 = 1 + (3/4)E1 + (3/4)*4Simplify (3/4)*4:(3/4)*4 = 3So, E1 = 1 + (3/4)E1 + 3Combine the constants:1 + 3 = 4So, E1 = 4 + (3/4)E1Now, subtract (3/4)E1 from both sides:E1 - (3/4)E1 = 4Which simplifies to:(1/4)E1 = 4Multiply both sides by 4:E1 = 16Now, substitute E1 back into equation 1:E0 = E1 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20So, E0 is 20. Therefore, the expected number of draws until two consecutive reds is 20.Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.From equation 1:E0 = 1 + (1/4)E1 + (3/4)E0Subtract (3/4)E0:(1/4)E0 = 1 + (1/4)E1Multiply by 4:E0 = 4 + E1Equation 2:E1 = 1 + (3/4)E0Substitute E0:E1 = 1 + (3/4)(E1 + 4)E1 = 1 + (3/4)E1 + 3E1 = 4 + (3/4)E1Subtract (3/4)E1:(1/4)E1 = 4E1 = 16Then E0 = 16 + 4 = 20Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe 20 is correct.Alternatively, let me think about another approach. Maybe using the concept of expected waiting times for patterns.In general, for a two-state system, the expected number of trials to get two consecutive successes (here, reds) can be calculated.The formula for the expected number of trials to get two consecutive successes in Bernoulli trials is known. Let me recall.If the probability of success is p, then the expected number of trials E is given by:E = (1 - p)/p^2 + 1/pWait, is that correct?Wait, actually, I think the formula is E = (1 + p)/p^2Wait, no, let me think again.Alternatively, I can model this as a Markov chain with states as I did before, which is probably the right way.Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I got E0 = 20, which is 20 draws. Since p = 1/4, let's see if that aligns.Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the expected waiting time for the first occurrence of two consecutive successes.I recall that in general, for a pattern of length k, the expected waiting time can be calculated, but for two consecutive successes, it's a specific case.I found a formula online before, but since I can't look it up now, let me try to recall.The expected number of trials E to get two consecutive successes with probability p is E = (1 + p)/p^2.Wait, let's test this formula with p = 1/2. Then E = (1 + 1/2)/(1/2)^2 = (3/2)/(1/4) = 6. But I know that for p = 1/2, the expected number is 6. So that seems correct.Similarly, for p = 1/3, E = (1 + 1/3)/(1/3)^2 = (4/3)/(1/9) = 12.Wait, but in our case, p = 1/4. So, plugging in, E = (1 + 1/4)/(1/4)^2 = (5/4)/(1/16) = (5/4)*16 = 20.Yes! So, that formula gives E = 20, which matches our earlier result.Therefore, that confirms that the expected number of draws is indeed 20.So, the answer is 20.**Final Answer**The expected value of ζ is boxed{20}."},{"question":"Find the limit lim _{x rightarrow infty} frac{x - sin x}{x + sin x}.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches infinity of (x - sin x) divided by (x + sin x). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with limits at infinity, especially involving trigonometric functions, sometimes the trigonometric parts become negligible compared to the polynomial terms. But I should verify that.First, let me write down the expression:lim(x→∞) (x - sin x)/(x + sin x)I notice that both the numerator and the denominator are expressions where x is the dominant term, and sin x oscillates between -1 and 1. So as x gets really large, sin x doesn't grow without bound; it just keeps oscillating. That makes me think that sin x becomes insignificant compared to x. So maybe I can factor out x from both the numerator and the denominator to simplify the expression.Let me try that. If I factor x from the numerator, I get:x(1 - (sin x)/x)Similarly, factoring x from the denominator gives:x(1 + (sin x)/x)So now the expression becomes:[x(1 - (sin x)/x)] / [x(1 + (sin x)/x)]The x terms in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, so we're left with:(1 - (sin x)/x) / (1 + (sin x)/x)Now, as x approaches infinity, what happens to (sin x)/x? Since sin x is bounded between -1 and 1, dividing it by x, which is getting larger and larger, will make (sin x)/x approach zero. So both the numerator and the denominator inside the brackets approach 1 - 0 and 1 + 0, respectively.Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:(1 - 0)/(1 + 0) = 1/1 = 1Wait, but hold on a second. Even though sin x is oscillating, when we divide it by x, it still approaches zero because x is growing without bound. So regardless of the oscillation, the term (sin x)/x becomes negligible. That makes sense.Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using L’Hospital’s Rule? Let me see. L’Hospital’s Rule is used when we have an indeterminate form like 0/0 or ∞/∞. In this case, as x approaches infinity, both the numerator and the denominator approach infinity, so it is indeed an ∞/∞ form. So maybe I can apply L’Hospital’s Rule.Let me try differentiating the numerator and the denominator with respect to x.The derivative of the numerator, d/dx [x - sin x], is 1 - cos x.The derivative of the denominator, d/dx [x + sin x], is 1 + cos x.So applying L’Hospital’s Rule, the limit becomes:lim(x→∞) (1 - cos x)/(1 + cos x)Hmm, now what is this limit? Let me think. The numerator is 1 - cos x, and the denominator is 1 + cos x. As x approaches infinity, cos x oscillates between -1 and 1. So 1 - cos x oscillates between 0 and 2, and 1 + cos x oscillates between 0 and 2 as well.Wait, so the expression (1 - cos x)/(1 + cos x) oscillates between 0 and infinity? Because when cos x is 1, the numerator becomes 0 and the denominator becomes 2, so the expression is 0. When cos x is -1, the numerator becomes 2 and the denominator becomes 0, so the expression tends to infinity. But cos x doesn't actually reach -1 infinitely often as x approaches infinity, does it? It oscillates between -1 and 1, so it gets arbitrarily close to both.But does this mean that the limit doesn't exist? Because the expression oscillates between 0 and infinity. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion where I factored out x and found the limit to be 1. So which one is correct?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in applying L’Hospital’s Rule. Let me double-check. L’Hospital’s Rule says that if we have a limit of the form ∞/∞ or 0/0, then the limit of the ratio is equal to the limit of the ratio of their derivatives, provided that this latter limit exists. In this case, after applying L’Hospital’s Rule, I got (1 - cos x)/(1 + cos x), which does not have a limit as x approaches infinity because it oscillates. So that suggests that the original limit might not exist.But that contradicts my initial approach where I factored out x and found the limit to be 1. So which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I need to analyze the original expression more carefully. Let me consider the original expression again:(x - sin x)/(x + sin x)I can rewrite this as:1 - (2 sin x)/(x + sin x)Wait, let me verify that:(x - sin x)/(x + sin x) = [ (x + sin x) - 2 sin x ] / (x + sin x) = 1 - (2 sin x)/(x + sin x)Yes, that's correct. So now, as x approaches infinity, the term (2 sin x)/(x + sin x) can be analyzed. Since sin x is bounded between -1 and 1, the numerator is bounded between -2 and 2, and the denominator x + sin x is approximately x for large x. So (2 sin x)/(x + sin x) is approximately (2 sin x)/x, which approaches zero as x approaches infinity.Therefore, the entire expression approaches 1 - 0 = 1.So that seems to confirm my initial approach. So why did L’Hospital’s Rule give me a different result? Maybe because L’Hospital’s Rule requires the limit of the derivatives to exist, but in this case, the limit of the derivatives does not exist because it oscillates. So perhaps L’Hospital’s Rule isn't applicable here, or at least doesn't give a definitive answer.Alternatively, maybe I should consider the squeeze theorem. Let me try that.Since sin x is bounded between -1 and 1, we can write:x - 1 ≤ x - sin x ≤ x + 1Similarly, for the denominator:x - 1 ≤ x + sin x ≤ x + 1So, let's consider the original expression:(x - sin x)/(x + sin x)We can bound this expression by considering the maximum and minimum possible values of the numerator and denominator.First, let's find a lower bound for the expression:(x - sin x)/(x + sin x) ≥ (x - 1)/(x + 1)Similarly, an upper bound:(x - sin x)/(x + sin x) ≤ (x + 1)/(x - 1)Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Since sin x can be as low as -1, so x - sin x can be as high as x + 1, and as low as x - 1. Similarly, x + sin x can be as high as x + 1, and as low as x - 1.So, to get the lower bound of the entire expression, we can take the smallest numerator over the largest denominator, which is (x - 1)/(x + 1). Similarly, the upper bound is (x + 1)/(x - 1).So now, let's compute the limits of these bounds as x approaches infinity.First, lim(x→∞) (x - 1)/(x + 1) = lim(x→∞) [1 - 1/x]/[1 + 1/x] = (1 - 0)/(1 + 0) = 1.Similarly, lim(x→∞) (x + 1)/(x - 1) = lim(x→∞) [1 + 1/x]/[1 - 1/x] = (1 + 0)/(1 - 0) = 1.Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, since both the lower and upper bounds approach 1, the original expression must also approach 1.So that confirms my initial conclusion that the limit is 1.But then why did L’Hospital’s Rule give me an indeterminate form? Maybe because L’Hospital’s Rule isn't always the right tool for every ∞/∞ limit. In this case, since the numerator and denominator both grow without bound, but the oscillatory nature of sin x complicates the derivative approach. However, by factoring out x or using the squeeze theorem, we can more effectively evaluate the limit.Alternatively, another approach is to divide both numerator and denominator by x. Let me try that.Dividing numerator and denominator by x:[1 - (sin x)/x] / [1 + (sin x)/x]As x approaches infinity, (sin x)/x approaches 0, so the expression becomes (1 - 0)/(1 + 0) = 1.That's another way to see it, and it's straightforward.So, in summary, regardless of the method I use—factoring out x, rewriting the expression, using the squeeze theorem, or dividing numerator and denominator by x—the limit comes out to be 1.Therefore, I can confidently say that the limit is 1.**Final Answer**The limit is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Is it true that the lateral surface area of a cone inscribed in a spherical segment (with its base circle and height being the same as those of the spherical segment) is the geometric mean between the area of the base circle and the surface area of the spherical cap?","answer":"Alright, so I came across this geometry problem, and it's a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step. The question is: Is it true that the lateral surface area of a cone inscribed in a spherical segment (with its base circle and height being the same as those of the spherical segment) is the geometric mean between the area of the base circle and the surface area of the spherical cap?First, let me make sure I understand all the terms here. A spherical segment is like a portion of a sphere cut off by two parallel planes. If it's a spherical segment with one base, it's called a spherical cap. So, in this case, the cone is inscribed in such a way that its base circle and height match those of the spherical segment. That probably means the cone is sitting inside the spherical segment with its base on the same base as the segment and its tip touching the top of the segment.The question is comparing three things: the lateral (or curved) surface area of the cone, the area of the base circle, and the surface area of the spherical cap. It claims that the lateral surface area of the cone is the geometric mean between the base area and the spherical cap's surface area. Remember, the geometric mean of two numbers a and b is sqrt(a*b). So, if we denote the lateral surface area as L, the base area as A, and the spherical cap surface area as S, the claim is that L = sqrt(A * S).To verify this, I think I need to express each of these areas in terms of the same variables and then see if the relationship holds.Let me start by recalling some formulas.1. The lateral surface area of a cone is given by π * r * l, where r is the radius of the base, and l is the slant height of the cone. The slant height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: l = sqrt(r² + h²), where h is the height of the cone.2. The area of the base circle is straightforward: A = π * r².3. The surface area of a spherical cap is given by 2 * π * R * h, where R is the radius of the sphere, and h is the height of the cap. Wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me double-check. Yes, the surface area of a spherical cap is indeed 2πRh, where R is the radius of the sphere, and h is the height of the cap. But in this case, the spherical segment's height is the same as the cone's height, so h is the same for both.But wait, in the case of a spherical cap, the height h is related to the radius R of the sphere and the radius r of the base of the cap. The relationship is given by h = R - sqrt(R² - r²). Let me verify that. If we have a spherical cap with height h and base radius r, then the radius R of the sphere can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the cross-section: R² = r² + (R - h)². Expanding that, R² = r² + R² - 2Rh + h². Simplifying, 0 = r² - 2Rh + h², so 2Rh = r² + h², hence R = (r² + h²)/(2h). Alternatively, solving for h, h = R - sqrt(R² - r²). Yeah, that seems right.But in our problem, the cone is inscribed in the spherical segment, which is essentially a spherical cap. So, the cone has the same base radius r and height h as the spherical cap. Therefore, we can relate R, r, and h for the spherical cap.So, let's write down the relationships:For the spherical cap:- Surface area S = 2πRh- Radius of the sphere R = (r² + h²)/(2h) [from earlier]For the cone:- Lateral surface area L = πr * l, where l is the slant height- Slant height l = sqrt(r² + h²)So, let's express L in terms of r and h:L = πr * sqrt(r² + h²)Now, let's express S in terms of r and h. Since R = (r² + h²)/(2h), substitute that into S:S = 2π * [(r² + h²)/(2h)] * h = 2π * (r² + h²)/2 = π(r² + h²)So, S = π(r² + h²)Now, let's compute the geometric mean of A and S:sqrt(A * S) = sqrt(πr² * π(r² + h²)) = sqrt(π²r²(r² + h²)) = πr * sqrt(r² + h²)Wait a minute, that's exactly the expression we had for L! So, L = sqrt(A * S). Therefore, the lateral surface area of the cone is indeed the geometric mean between the area of the base circle and the surface area of the spherical cap.But let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Start with the spherical cap. Its surface area is 2πRh, and its height is h, with base radius r. The sphere's radius R is related to r and h by R = (r² + h²)/(2h).2. The cone inscribed in the spherical cap has the same base radius r and height h. Its lateral surface area is πr * sqrt(r² + h²).3. The area of the base circle is A = πr².4. The surface area of the spherical cap is S = 2πRh. Substituting R from above, S = 2π * [(r² + h²)/(2h)] * h = π(r² + h²).5. Compute sqrt(A * S): sqrt(πr² * π(r² + h²)) = sqrt(π²r²(r² + h²)) = πr * sqrt(r² + h²), which is exactly L.So, yes, it seems correct. The lateral surface area of the cone is indeed the geometric mean between the base area and the spherical cap's surface area.But just to be thorough, let me plug in some numbers to see if this holds.Suppose r = 3 and h = 4.Compute R for the spherical cap:R = (3² + 4²)/(2*4) = (9 + 16)/8 = 25/8 = 3.125Surface area S of the cap:S = 2π * 3.125 * 4 = 2π * 12.5 = 25πArea of the base circle A:A = π * 3² = 9πCompute the geometric mean sqrt(A * S):sqrt(9π * 25π) = sqrt(225π²) = 15πCompute the lateral surface area L of the cone:L = π * 3 * sqrt(3² + 4²) = 3π * 5 = 15πYep, they match. So, in this case, L = 15π, which is indeed the geometric mean of A = 9π and S = 25π.Let me try another example. Let r = 1 and h = 1.Compute R:R = (1 + 1)/(2*1) = 2/2 = 1Surface area S:S = 2π * 1 * 1 = 2πArea of the base circle A:A = π * 1² = πGeometric mean sqrt(A * S):sqrt(π * 2π) = sqrt(2π²) = π * sqrt(2)Lateral surface area L:L = π * 1 * sqrt(1 + 1) = π * sqrt(2)Again, they match.One more example. Let r = 5 and h = 12.Compute R:R = (25 + 144)/(24) = 169/24 ≈ 7.0417Surface area S:S = 2π * 7.0417 * 12 ≈ 2π * 84.5 ≈ 169πArea of the base circle A:A = π * 25 = 25πGeometric mean sqrt(A * S):sqrt(25π * 169π) = sqrt(4225π²) = 65πLateral surface area L:L = π * 5 * sqrt(25 + 144) = 5π * 13 = 65πPerfect, again, they match.So, through both algebraic manipulation and numerical examples, it seems that the lateral surface area of the cone is indeed the geometric mean between the base area and the spherical cap's surface area.Therefore, the statement is true.**Final Answer**boxed{True}"},{"question":"Find all functions ( f: mathbf{R} rightarrow mathbf{R} ) such that for any real numbers ( x ) and ( y ), the following holds:[ f(f(x) + y) = 2x + f(f(y) - x). ]","answer":"Okay, so I have this functional equation to solve: ( f(f(x) + y) = 2x + f(f(y) - x) ). Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I should recall some common strategies for solving functional equations. Often, substituting specific values for variables can help simplify the equation or reveal properties of the function ( f ). Maybe I can try plugging in some particular values for ( x ) or ( y ) to see if that leads me anywhere.Let me start by setting ( y = 0 ). That might simplify things. So, substituting ( y = 0 ), the equation becomes:( f(f(x) + 0) = 2x + f(f(0) - x) )Simplifying that, we get:( f(f(x)) = 2x + f(f(0) - x) )Hmm, okay. That's interesting. Let me denote ( c = f(0) ) for simplicity. So, the equation becomes:( f(f(x)) = 2x + f(c - x) )I don't know what ( c ) is yet, but maybe I can find another equation involving ( c ) by choosing another substitution.What if I set ( x = 0 ) in the original equation? Let's try that:( f(f(0) + y) = 2(0) + f(f(y) - 0) )Simplifying, that's:( f(c + y) = f(f(y)) )So, ( f(c + y) = f(f(y)) ). Maybe I can use this to substitute back into the equation I got earlier.Earlier, I had ( f(f(x)) = 2x + f(c - x) ). But from this new equation, ( f(f(x)) = f(c + x) ). So, substituting that in, we get:( f(c + x) = 2x + f(c - x) )Hmm, that's a nice relation. Let me write that as:( f(c + x) - f(c - x) = 2x )This looks like a difference equation. Maybe I can consider the function ( g(x) = f(c + x) - f(c - x) ). Then, ( g(x) = 2x ).But ( g(x) ) is defined in terms of ( f ). Maybe I can explore more properties of ( f ) using this.Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that ( f ) is linear. Sometimes, functional equations have linear solutions. Let me suppose that ( f(x) = ax + b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are constants. Maybe I can find ( a ) and ( b ) that satisfy the equation.Let's substitute ( f(x) = ax + b ) into the original equation:( f(f(x) + y) = 2x + f(f(y) - x) )First, compute ( f(f(x) + y) ):( f(f(x) + y) = a(f(x) + y) + b = a(ax + b + y) + b = a^2x + ab + ay + b )Now, compute the right-hand side: ( 2x + f(f(y) - x) )First, compute ( f(y) = a y + b ), so ( f(y) - x = a y + b - x ). Then, ( f(f(y) - x) = a(a y + b - x) + b = a^2 y + ab - a x + b ).So, the right-hand side becomes:( 2x + a^2 y + ab - a x + b = (2 - a)x + a^2 y + ab + b )Now, set the left-hand side equal to the right-hand side:Left: ( a^2x + ab + ay + b )Right: ( (2 - a)x + a^2 y + ab + b )So, equate coefficients for like terms.First, the coefficients of ( x ):Left: ( a^2 )Right: ( 2 - a )So, ( a^2 = 2 - a )Similarly, coefficients of ( y ):Left: ( a )Right: ( a^2 )So, ( a = a^2 )And the constants:Left: ( ab + b )Right: ( ab + b )Which are equal, so no new information there.So, from the coefficients of ( y ), we have ( a = a^2 ), which implies ( a(a - 1) = 0 ), so ( a = 0 ) or ( a = 1 ).Let's consider each case.Case 1: ( a = 0 )Then, from the coefficients of ( x ): ( a^2 = 0 = 2 - a ), which would mean ( 0 = 2 - 0 = 2 ), which is not true. So, ( a = 0 ) is not a solution.Case 2: ( a = 1 )Then, from the coefficients of ( x ): ( a^2 = 1 = 2 - a ). So, ( 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 ), which holds.So, ( a = 1 ) is a valid solution. Now, let's find ( b ).We know that ( c = f(0) = a*0 + b = b ). So, ( c = b ).Earlier, we had the equation ( f(c + x) - f(c - x) = 2x ). Let's substitute ( f(x) = x + b ) into this:( f(c + x) - f(c - x) = (c + x + b) - (c - x + b) = (c + x + b) - c + x - b = 2x )Which simplifies to ( 2x = 2x ), so that holds for any ( c ) and ( b ). But since ( c = b ), we can just say ( f(x) = x + b ).But we need to determine ( b ). Let's use another substitution in the original equation to find ( b ).Let me set ( x = 0 ) in the original equation:( f(f(0) + y) = 2(0) + f(f(y) - 0) )Simplify:( f(c + y) = f(f(y)) )But ( f(y) = y + b ), so ( f(f(y)) = f(y + b) = (y + b) + b = y + 2b ).On the left-hand side, ( f(c + y) = (c + y) + b = c + y + b ).So, setting them equal:( c + y + b = y + 2b )Simplify:( c + b = 2b )Thus, ( c = b ). But we already knew that ( c = b ), so this doesn't give us new information.Hmm, maybe I need another substitution. Let's try setting ( y = -f(x) ) in the original equation. That might lead to something.So, set ( y = -f(x) ):( f(f(x) + (-f(x))) = 2x + f(f(-f(x)) - x) )Simplify:( f(0) = 2x + f(f(-f(x)) - x) )So, ( c = 2x + f(f(-f(x)) - x) )Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I can express ( f(-f(x)) ) in terms of ( x ).Since ( f(x) = x + b ), then ( f(-f(x)) = f(-x - b) = (-x - b) + b = -x ).So, ( f(-f(x)) = -x ). Therefore, ( f(-f(x)) - x = -x - x = -2x ).Thus, ( f(f(-f(x)) - x) = f(-2x) = (-2x) + b ).So, substituting back into the equation:( c = 2x + (-2x + b) )Simplify:( c = 2x - 2x + b = b )Which is consistent with ( c = b ). So, again, no new information.Maybe another substitution. How about setting ( x = y )?Let me try ( x = y ):( f(f(x) + x) = 2x + f(f(x) - x) )Compute both sides.Left-hand side: ( f(f(x) + x) = f((x + b) + x) = f(2x + b) = 2x + b + b = 2x + 2b )Right-hand side: ( 2x + f(f(x) - x) = 2x + f((x + b) - x) = 2x + f(b) = 2x + (b + b) = 2x + 2b )So, both sides are equal. Again, no new information.Hmm, maybe I need to consider another approach. Let's recall that earlier, we had ( f(f(x)) = 2x + f(c - x) ). Since ( f(x) = x + b ), let's compute ( f(f(x)) ):( f(f(x)) = f(x + b) = (x + b) + b = x + 2b )On the other hand, ( 2x + f(c - x) = 2x + (c - x + b) = 2x + c - x + b = x + c + b )Set them equal:( x + 2b = x + c + b )Simplify:( 2b = c + b )Thus, ( c = b ). Again, consistent, but not new.Wait, so all these substitutions are just confirming that ( c = b ), but not giving me the value of ( b ). Maybe I need to find another equation involving ( b ).Let me go back to the original equation and try plugging in ( x = c ). Since ( c = b ), this might lead to something.Set ( x = c ):( f(f(c) + y) = 2c + f(f(y) - c) )Compute ( f(c) ): ( f(c) = c + b = b + b = 2b )So, left-hand side: ( f(2b + y) = (2b + y) + b = 3b + y )Right-hand side: ( 2c + f(f(y) - c) = 2b + f((y + b) - b) = 2b + f(y) = 2b + y + b = 3b + y )So, both sides are equal. Again, no new information.Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Since ( f(x) = x + b ) seems to satisfy the equation for any ( b ), but wait, is that true?Wait, let me test ( f(x) = x + b ) in the original equation.Compute left-hand side: ( f(f(x) + y) = f(x + b + y) = (x + b + y) + b = x + y + 2b )Compute right-hand side: ( 2x + f(f(y) - x) = 2x + f(y + b - x) = 2x + (y + b - x) + b = 2x + y + b - x + b = x + y + 2b )So, both sides are equal. Therefore, ( f(x) = x + b ) satisfies the equation for any real constant ( b ). But wait, in our earlier substitution when we set ( x = 0 ), we found that ( f(c + y) = f(f(y)) ). If ( f(y) = y + b ), then ( f(c + y) = c + y + b ) and ( f(f(y)) = f(y + b) = y + 2b ). So, ( c + y + b = y + 2b ), which gives ( c = b ). So, ( c = b ) is consistent.But wait, earlier when I set ( x = 0 ), I found ( f(c + y) = f(f(y)) ), which led to ( c = b ). So, ( c = b ) is necessary, but ( b ) can be any real number. So, does that mean that all functions of the form ( f(x) = x + b ) satisfy the equation?But wait, let me check with ( b neq 0 ). Suppose ( b = 1 ), so ( f(x) = x + 1 ). Let's test the original equation:Left-hand side: ( f(f(x) + y) = f(x + 1 + y) = (x + y + 1) + 1 = x + y + 2 )Right-hand side: ( 2x + f(f(y) - x) = 2x + f(y + 1 - x) = 2x + (y + 1 - x) + 1 = 2x + y + 1 - x + 1 = x + y + 2 )So, both sides are equal. Similarly, if ( b = 2 ), same thing:Left: ( f(f(x) + y) = f(x + 2 + y) = x + y + 4 )Right: ( 2x + f(f(y) - x) = 2x + f(y + 2 - x) = 2x + (y + 2 - x) + 2 = 2x + y + 2 - x + 2 = x + y + 4 )Again, equal. So, it seems that any function ( f(x) = x + b ) satisfies the equation.But wait, earlier when I assumed ( f ) is linear, I found that ( a = 1 ) and ( b ) is arbitrary. So, is that the only solution?Wait, but maybe there are non-linear solutions as well. I assumed ( f ) is linear, but the problem doesn't specify that ( f ) has to be linear. So, perhaps I need to check if there are other solutions.Let me see. Suppose ( f ) is not linear. Is that possible?Wait, from earlier, we had ( f(c + x) - f(c - x) = 2x ). If ( f ) is linear, this holds. But what if ( f ) is non-linear?Suppose ( f ) is quadratic, say ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ). Let's see if that can satisfy the equation.But before going into that, maybe I can find more properties of ( f ).From the equation ( f(c + x) - f(c - x) = 2x ), which is similar to the definition of an odd function shifted by ( c ). If ( f ) were odd about ( c ), then ( f(c + x) = -f(c - x) + 2f(c) ). But in our case, ( f(c + x) - f(c - x) = 2x ). So, it's a bit different.Alternatively, maybe ( f ) is affine linear, which is the case we already considered.Alternatively, perhaps ( f ) is bijective. Let me check if ( f ) is injective or surjective.Suppose ( f ) is injective. Let me see if that can be inferred.From the original equation: ( f(f(x) + y) = 2x + f(f(y) - x) )If I fix ( x ) and vary ( y ), the left-hand side is ( f ) evaluated at ( f(x) + y ), which can take any real value as ( y ) varies, since ( f(x) ) is fixed and ( y ) can be any real number. Similarly, the right-hand side is ( 2x + f(f(y) - x) ). Since ( f(y) ) can take any real value (assuming ( f ) is surjective), ( f(f(y) - x) ) can also take any real value, so the right-hand side can take any real value as ( y ) varies. Therefore, ( f ) is surjective.So, ( f ) is surjective.Now, is ( f ) injective? Suppose ( f(a) = f(b) ). Let me see if this implies ( a = b ).From the original equation, set ( x = a ) and ( x = b ):For ( x = a ): ( f(f(a) + y) = 2a + f(f(y) - a) )For ( x = b ): ( f(f(b) + y) = 2b + f(f(y) - b) )But since ( f(a) = f(b) ), the left-hand sides are equal for all ( y ). Therefore, ( 2a + f(f(y) - a) = 2b + f(f(y) - b) ) for all ( y ).Let me denote ( z = f(y) ). Since ( f ) is surjective, ( z ) can be any real number. So, the equation becomes:( 2a + f(z - a) = 2b + f(z - b) ) for all ( z ).Rearranging, ( f(z - a) - f(z - b) = 2(b - a) ).Let me set ( w = z - a ), so ( z = w + a ). Then, the equation becomes:( f(w) - f(w + a - b) = 2(b - a) )This is a functional equation in itself. Let me denote ( d = a - b ). Then, the equation becomes:( f(w) - f(w + d) = -2d )Or, ( f(w + d) = f(w) + 2d )This is a kind of functional equation. Let me see if I can solve this.Suppose ( f(w + d) = f(w) + 2d ). Let me iterate this:( f(w + 2d) = f(w + d) + 2d = f(w) + 4d )Similarly, ( f(w + 3d) = f(w + 2d) + 2d = f(w) + 6d ), and so on.In general, ( f(w + nd) = f(w) + 2nd ) for any integer ( n ).This suggests that ( f ) is linear with slope 2 when moving in steps of ( d ). But unless ( d = 0 ), which would mean ( a = b ), this could lead to a contradiction unless ( f ) is linear everywhere.Wait, but if ( d neq 0 ), then ( f ) would have to be linear with slope 2, but earlier we found that ( f ) is affine linear with slope 1. So, unless ( d = 0 ), which would mean ( a = b ), we have a contradiction.Therefore, ( d = 0 ), so ( a = b ). Therefore, ( f ) is injective.So, ( f ) is bijective.Now, knowing that ( f ) is bijective, maybe I can find its inverse function or find another substitution.Let me try to find ( f^{-1} ). Since ( f ) is bijective, it has an inverse.From the original equation: ( f(f(x) + y) = 2x + f(f(y) - x) )Let me denote ( u = f(x) + y ). Then, ( y = u - f(x) ).Substituting into the equation:( f(u) = 2x + f(f(u - f(x)) - x) )Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can set ( y = -f(x) ) as before, but I think I tried that earlier.Wait, earlier when I set ( y = -f(x) ), I got ( c = 2x + f(-2x) ). But since ( f ) is bijective, maybe I can express ( x ) in terms of ( f ).Wait, ( f(-2x) = c - 2x ). So, ( f(-2x) = c - 2x ). Let me denote ( z = -2x ), so ( x = -z/2 ). Then, ( f(z) = c - 2*(-z/2) = c + z ). So, ( f(z) = z + c ).Wait, that's interesting. So, ( f(z) = z + c ). But earlier, I had ( f(x) = x + b ), so ( c = b ). So, ( f(z) = z + c ), which is consistent with ( f(x) = x + c ).Therefore, ( f(x) = x + c ) is the only solution, and ( c ) is a constant.Wait, but earlier, when I assumed ( f ) is linear, I found that ( f(x) = x + b ) works for any ( b ). But now, through injectivity and bijectivity, I deduced that ( f(x) = x + c ). So, that seems consistent.But let me verify this conclusion.From the equation ( f(z) = z + c ), which is derived from setting ( y = -f(x) ) and using bijectivity, we can conclude that ( f ) must be of the form ( f(x) = x + c ).Therefore, the only solutions are linear functions of the form ( f(x) = x + c ), where ( c ) is a constant.But earlier, when I substituted ( f(x) = x + b ) into the original equation, it worked for any ( b ). So, does that mean that all such functions satisfy the equation?Wait, let me test ( f(x) = x + c ) in the original equation again to make sure.Left-hand side: ( f(f(x) + y) = f(x + c + y) = (x + c + y) + c = x + y + 2c )Right-hand side: ( 2x + f(f(y) - x) = 2x + f(y + c - x) = 2x + (y + c - x) + c = 2x + y + c - x + c = x + y + 2c )Yes, both sides are equal. So, ( f(x) = x + c ) satisfies the equation for any constant ( c ).But wait, earlier when I considered ( f(x) = x + b ), I found that ( c = b ). So, ( c ) is just the constant term in the function, which can be any real number.Therefore, the general solution is ( f(x) = x + c ), where ( c ) is a real constant.But let me check if there are any restrictions on ( c ). From the equation ( f(c + x) - f(c - x) = 2x ), substituting ( f(x) = x + c ):( f(c + x) - f(c - x) = (c + x + c) - (c - x + c) = (2c + x) - (2c - x) = 2x )Which holds for any ( c ). So, no restrictions on ( c ).Therefore, all functions ( f(x) = x + c ) satisfy the equation, where ( c ) is any real constant.Wait, but in the beginning, when I set ( y = 0 ), I got ( f(f(x)) = 2x + f(c - x) ). With ( f(x) = x + c ), let's verify this:Left-hand side: ( f(f(x)) = f(x + c) = x + c + c = x + 2c )Right-hand side: ( 2x + f(c - x) = 2x + (c - x + c) = 2x + 2c - x = x + 2c )So, both sides are equal. Therefore, consistent.Therefore, I think I've found all solutions: all linear functions of the form ( f(x) = x + c ), where ( c ) is a real constant.But wait, let me think again. The problem says \\"find all functions ( f: mathbf{R} rightarrow mathbf{R} )\\", so I need to make sure that these are the only solutions.Earlier, I assumed ( f ) is linear and found that it works. Then, by considering injectivity and surjectivity, I deduced that ( f ) must be linear of the form ( f(x) = x + c ). So, I think that's the complete solution set.Therefore, the functions satisfying the equation are all linear functions with slope 1, i.e., ( f(x) = x + c ) for some constant ( c in mathbf{R} ).**Final Answer**The solutions are all linear functions of the form boxed{f(x) = x + c} where ( c ) is a real constant."},{"question":"In the vertices of a regular dodecagon, natural numbers from 1 to 12 were arranged in some order (each number is used exactly once). Is it possible that the sums of all pairs of adjacent numbers are prime, and the sums of all pairs of numbers that have exactly two numbers between them are also prime?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. The vertices are labeled with natural numbers from 1 to 12, each used exactly once. The question is whether it's possible to arrange these numbers such that two conditions are satisfied:1. The sum of every pair of adjacent numbers is a prime number.2. The sum of every pair of numbers that have exactly two numbers between them is also a prime number.Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.First, let's visualize the dodecagon. It has 12 vertices, each connected to two adjacent vertices. Additionally, each vertex is connected to another vertex that's two steps away, meaning there are exactly two numbers between them. So, for each vertex, there are two adjacent vertices and two vertices that are two steps away.Therefore, each number will be part of four sums: two adjacent sums and two sums with numbers two steps away. All of these sums need to be prime numbers.Since we're dealing with numbers from 1 to 12, the possible sums can range from 1+2=3 up to 11+12=23. So, the primes we might encounter are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.Wait, let me list all primes up to 23:2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.But since the smallest sum is 3 (1+2), and the largest is 23 (11+12), we can ignore 2.So, the possible prime sums are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.Now, let's think about the numbers 1 to 12. Each number is used exactly once, so each number will be part of four sums: two adjacent and two with two numbers in between.Given that, each number must be such that when added to its two adjacent numbers and its two \\"two-apart\\" numbers, all four sums are prime.This seems quite restrictive. Maybe we can look for properties of numbers that can only be paired with certain other numbers to form primes.First, let's note that 1 is a special number because adding 1 to another number will give a prime only if the other number is even (since 1 + even = odd, which can be prime, but 1 + odd = even, which is only prime if it's 2, but 1 +1=2, but 1 is only used once). Wait, actually, 1 is odd, so adding 1 to an even number gives an odd number, which could be prime, but adding 1 to an odd number gives an even number, which is only prime if it's 2. But since we're adding 1 to another number, the smallest sum is 1+2=3, which is prime, but 1+3=4, which is not prime. So, 1 can only be adjacent to even numbers because 1 + even is odd, which can be prime, but 1 + odd is even, which is not prime (except for 2, but 1+1=2, but 1 is only used once). Therefore, 1 must be adjacent only to even numbers.Similarly, 2 is the only even prime. So, 2 is even, and adding 2 to another number can give both even and odd sums. But since 2 is even, adding it to an odd number gives an odd sum, which can be prime, and adding it to an even number gives an even sum, which is only prime if it's 2, but since 2 is already used, the sum would be at least 4, which is not prime. Therefore, 2 must be adjacent only to odd numbers.Wait, let me clarify:- 1 must be adjacent only to even numbers because 1 + odd is even (and greater than 2, so not prime), but 1 + even is odd, which can be prime.- 2 must be adjacent only to odd numbers because 2 + even is even (and greater than 2, so not prime), but 2 + odd is odd, which can be prime.So, 1 and 2 have specific restrictions on their neighbors.Similarly, let's think about other numbers:- 3 is odd. 3 + even is odd, which can be prime; 3 + odd is even, which is not prime (except 2, but 3 + (-1)=2, which isn't in our set). So, 3 must be adjacent only to even numbers.Wait, hold on:Wait, 3 is odd. So, 3 + even is odd, which can be prime. 3 + odd is even, which is not prime (except 2, but 3 + (-1)=2, which isn't in our set). So, 3 must be adjacent only to even numbers.Similarly, 4 is even. 4 + odd is odd, which can be prime; 4 + even is even, which is not prime (except 2, but 4 + (-2)=2, which isn't in our set). So, 4 must be adjacent only to odd numbers.Wait, this seems to be a pattern:- Odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9,11) must be adjacent only to even numbers because odd + even = odd, which can be prime, while odd + odd = even, which is not prime (except 2, which is too small).- Even numbers (2,4,6,8,10,12) must be adjacent only to odd numbers because even + odd = odd, which can be prime, while even + even = even, which is not prime (except 2, which is too small).Therefore, in the dodecagon, the numbers must alternate between odd and even. Since 12 is even, the dodecagon has 12 vertices, which is even, so it's possible to alternate perfectly between odd and even numbers.So, the arrangement must be such that odd and even numbers alternate around the dodecagon.This is a crucial observation. So, in the circle, we have 6 odd numbers and 6 even numbers, alternating.Therefore, each odd number is adjacent to two even numbers, and each even number is adjacent to two odd numbers.Similarly, for the pairs with two numbers between them, let's think about that.In a dodecagon, each vertex has two neighbors two steps away. So, for each vertex, the two numbers two steps away are also part of the same parity? Wait, let's see.If the numbers alternate between odd and even, then moving two steps from an odd number would land on another odd number, because odd -> even -> odd. Similarly, moving two steps from an even number would land on another even number.Therefore, the pairs with two numbers between them consist of two numbers of the same parity.So, for example, if we have an odd number, the numbers two steps away are also odd, so their sum is even (since odd + odd = even). Similarly, for even numbers, the numbers two steps away are even, so their sum is even (even + even = even).But wait, except for 2, all even numbers are not prime. So, the sums of two odd numbers or two even numbers must be prime. But the sum of two odds is even, and the sum of two evens is even. The only even prime is 2. However, the smallest sum of two numbers from 1 to 12 is 1+2=3, so the sums we're considering are at least 3. Therefore, the sums of two odds or two evens must be 2, which is impossible because the sums are at least 3. Therefore, all these sums must be even numbers greater than 2, which are not prime.Wait, that's a problem.Wait, hold on. If the numbers alternate between odd and even, then the pairs two steps apart are same parity, so their sums are even and greater than 2, hence composite. Therefore, it's impossible for these sums to be prime.But the problem states that the sums of all pairs of numbers that have exactly two numbers between them must also be prime. So, if the numbers are arranged alternately, the two-apart sums are even and greater than 2, hence composite, which violates the condition.Therefore, such an arrangement is impossible.Wait, but hold on. Maybe the numbers don't alternate? But earlier, I thought that because of the adjacency condition, numbers must alternate between odd and even.Wait, let me re-examine that.We have numbers 1 to 12. Each number is adjacent to two others, and each adjacency must sum to a prime.We noticed that 1 must be adjacent only to even numbers because 1 + odd is even and greater than 2, hence composite, which is not allowed.Similarly, 2 must be adjacent only to odd numbers because 2 + even is even and greater than 2, hence composite.Similarly, 3 must be adjacent only to even numbers because 3 + odd is even and greater than 2, hence composite.Similarly, 4 must be adjacent only to odd numbers because 4 + even is even and greater than 2, hence composite.This pattern continues for all numbers: odd numbers must be adjacent only to even numbers, and even numbers must be adjacent only to odd numbers.Therefore, the arrangement must alternate between odd and even numbers.But as a result, the two-apart sums are same parity, hence even and greater than 2, hence composite, which violates the second condition.Therefore, it's impossible to arrange the numbers 1 to 12 in a dodecagon such that both the adjacent sums and the two-apart sums are prime.Wait, but before concluding, let me think if there's a way to arrange numbers without strictly alternating parity.Is it possible to have two odds or two evens adjacent somewhere, but still satisfy the prime sum conditions?Wait, for example, suppose two odds are adjacent. Then their sum is even, which must be prime. The only even prime is 2, but the smallest sum of two odds is 1+3=4, which is composite. So, two odds cannot be adjacent because their sum would be even and at least 4, which is composite.Similarly, two evens cannot be adjacent because their sum is even and at least 2+4=6, which is composite.Therefore, it's impossible to have two odds or two evens adjacent. Therefore, the arrangement must strictly alternate between odd and even numbers.Therefore, the two-apart sums are same parity, hence even and composite, which violates the second condition.Therefore, such an arrangement is impossible.Wait, but hold on. Let me think again.Is it possible that the two-apart sums are primes? For that, the two numbers two apart must be of opposite parity? But in an alternating arrangement, two apart would be same parity, so their sum is even, which is composite.Alternatively, if the arrangement isn't strictly alternating, but then we saw that two odds or two evens adjacent would lead to composite sums, which is not allowed.Therefore, the arrangement must alternate, but then the two-apart sums are composite. Therefore, it's impossible.Wait, but let me think about specific numbers.For example, 1 must be adjacent only to even numbers. Let's say 1 is next to 2 and 12.Then, 2 must be adjacent to 1 and another odd number, say 3.But then, 3 must be adjacent to 2 and another even number, say 4.Continuing this way, we alternate between odd and even.But then, the two-apart sums would be 1 and 3, which are both odd, so 1+3=4, which is composite. Similarly, 2 and 4 are both even, so 2+4=6, composite.Therefore, regardless of how we arrange, the two-apart sums would be same parity, hence composite.Therefore, it's impossible.Wait, but wait another thought: maybe the two-apart sums are allowed to be 2? But 2 is only possible if both numbers are 1, but 1 is only used once. So, no.Alternatively, maybe the two-apart sums can be primes in some way, but as we saw, same parity leads to even sums, which are composite.Therefore, it's impossible.Wait, but let me think about the specific numbers.Wait, 1 is odd, so it must be adjacent to even numbers. Let's say 1 is between 2 and 12.Then, 2 is even, so it must be adjacent to 1 and another odd number, say 3.3 is odd, so it must be adjacent to 2 and another even number, say 4.4 is even, adjacent to 3 and another odd, say 5.5 is odd, adjacent to 4 and another even, say 6.6 is even, adjacent to 5 and another odd, say 7.7 is odd, adjacent to 6 and another even, say 8.8 is even, adjacent to 7 and another odd, say 9.9 is odd, adjacent to 8 and another even, say 10.10 is even, adjacent to 9 and another odd, say 11.11 is odd, adjacent to 10 and another even, say 12.12 is even, adjacent to 11 and 1.So, this is a possible arrangement: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 arranged alternately.But now, let's check the two-apart sums.Starting from 1: two apart is 3. 1+3=4, composite.From 2: two apart is 4. 2+4=6, composite.From 3: two apart is 5. 3+5=8, composite.From 4: two apart is 6. 4+6=10, composite.From 5: two apart is 7. 5+7=12, composite.From 6: two apart is 8. 6+8=14, composite.From 7: two apart is 9. 7+9=16, composite.From 8: two apart is 10. 8+10=18, composite.From 9: two apart is 11. 9+11=20, composite.From 10: two apart is 12. 10+12=22, composite.From 11: two apart is 1. 11+1=12, composite.From 12: two apart is 2. 12+2=14, composite.So, all two-apart sums are composite. Therefore, this arrangement doesn't satisfy the second condition.But maybe there's another arrangement where the two-apart sums are prime.Wait, but given that the two-apart sums are same parity, their sums are even and greater than 2, hence composite. Therefore, regardless of the arrangement, the two-apart sums will be even and composite.Therefore, it's impossible to satisfy both conditions.Hence, the answer is no, it's not possible.**Final Answer**boxed{No}"},{"question":"The bisector of angle ( A ) in triangle ( ABC ) intersects the circumcircle of the triangle at point ( D ). Find the length of chord ( DC ) if the center of the incircle of the triangle is at a distance (boldsymbol{n}) from point ( D ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: In triangle ABC, the bisector of angle A intersects the circumcircle at point D. I need to find the length of chord DC, given that the center of the incircle is at a distance n from point D. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, let me draw triangle ABC. Let me label the vertices A, B, and C. The angle bisector of angle A will split angle A into two equal parts. So, if I draw the bisector, it will meet side BC at some point, say E, but then it also intersects the circumcircle again at point D. So, point D is diametrically opposite to where the bisector meets the circumcircle? Wait, not necessarily diametrically opposite, just another intersection point.Now, the incircle of triangle ABC is tangent to all three sides. Its center is called the incenter, which is the intersection of the angle bisectors. So, the incenter is equidistant from all sides. The problem says that the incenter is at a distance n from point D. So, the distance between the incenter (let's call it I) and point D is n. I need to find the length of chord DC.Hmm, okay. Let me recall some properties of angle bisectors and circumcircles. The angle bisector theorem might come into play here. Also, since D is on the circumcircle, maybe some cyclic quadrilateral properties or power of a point could be useful.Wait, since AD is the angle bisector, and D is on the circumcircle, perhaps there are some known relationships or theorems about this configuration. I think there's a theorem that says that the angle bisector of angle A meets the circumcircle at the midpoint of the arc BC. Is that right? Let me think.Yes, actually, in a triangle, the angle bisector of angle A does pass through the midpoint of the arc BC that doesn't contain A. So, point D is the midpoint of arc BC. That means BD = DC in terms of arc length, but does that translate to chord lengths? Hmm, not necessarily, unless the arcs are equal, which they are, so actually, the chords BD and DC should be equal in length. Wait, is that correct?Wait, if D is the midpoint of arc BC, then arcs BD and DC are equal. Therefore, chords BD and DC should be equal in length. So, BD = DC. So, if I can find BD, then I can find DC. But the problem is asking for DC, so maybe I can express DC in terms of other known quantities.But I don't know the sides of the triangle or any other lengths. The only given is the distance from the incenter I to point D is n. So, I need to relate this distance n to the length DC.Let me think about coordinates. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system could help. Let me consider placing point A at (0,0), point B at (c,0), and point C somewhere in the plane. But that might get too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric relationships or vector methods. Hmm, perhaps using the properties of the inradius and the distance from the incenter to D.Wait, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, but here, the distance from the incenter to point D is given. So, it's not the inradius, but the distance from I to D is n.I need to find a relationship between n and DC. Maybe I can express DC in terms of other elements of the triangle, like the sides, angles, or the inradius.Let me recall that the inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter: r = area / semiperimeter. But I don't know the area or the sides, so maybe that's not directly helpful.Wait, maybe I can use coordinates for points A, B, C, and then find expressions for D and I, and then compute the distance between I and D.Let me try that approach. Let me place triangle ABC in a coordinate system. Let me set point A at (0,0), point B at (c,0), and point C at coordinates (d,e). Then, the incenter I can be found using the formula:I = ( (aA + bB + cC) / (a + b + c) ), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to angles A, B, C respectively.Wait, actually, the coordinates of the incenter are given by ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/ (a + b + c), (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C)/ (a + b + c) ). So, if I set A at (0,0), B at (c,0), and C at (d,e), then the incenter I would have coordinates:I_x = (a*0 + b*c + c*d) / (a + b + c)I_y = (a*0 + b*0 + c*e) / (a + b + c)So, I = ( (b c + c d)/ (a + b + c), (c e)/ (a + b + c) )But this might get too messy. Maybe there's a better coordinate system.Alternatively, maybe I can use barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC. In barycentric coordinates, the incenter has coordinates proportional to the lengths of the sides. Specifically, the incenter is at (a : b : c). But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Wait, maybe I can use vector methods. Let me denote vectors from the circumcircle. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that D is the midpoint of arc BC, which means that D is equidistant from B and C on the circumcircle. So, BD = DC as chords. Therefore, DC is equal to BD.But I need to find DC in terms of n, the distance from I to D.Wait, maybe I can consider triangle IDC. If I can find the lengths of ID, IC, and angle between them, I can use the Law of Cosines to find DC. But I don't know IC or the angle.Wait, IC is the distance from the incenter to point C. Is there a formula for that? Let me recall.Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed using the formula:IC = sqrt{r^2 + (s - c)^2}where r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and c is the length of side AB.Wait, is that correct? Let me verify.Yes, the distance from the incenter to vertex C is given by:IC = sqrt{r^2 + (s - c)^2}Similarly, the distance from the incenter to vertex B is:IB = sqrt{r^2 + (s - b)^2}And the distance from the incenter to vertex A is:IA = sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2}So, in our case, IC is known in terms of r and s. But I don't know r or s. Hmm.Wait, but maybe I can relate r and s to other quantities.Also, since D is on the circumcircle, maybe I can find the distance ID in terms of other elements.Wait, the distance between the incenter and a point on the circumcircle. Is there a known formula for that?I think there is a formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, but here, D is a point on the circumcircle, not necessarily the circumcenter.Hmm, so maybe I need to find a relationship between ID, IC, and DC.Wait, let's consider triangle IDC. We have ID = n, IC = sqrt(r^2 + (s - c)^2), and DC is the side we need to find. If we can find angle IDC, then we can apply the Law of Cosines.But how can we find angle IDC? Maybe we can relate it to other angles in the triangle.Alternatively, maybe we can use coordinates or trigonometric identities.Wait, maybe if I can express the coordinates of D in terms of the triangle's coordinates, then compute the distance from I to D.But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.Wait, another idea: since D is the midpoint of arc BC, it is equidistant from B and C, and also, the angle BDC is equal to angle BAC / 2, because D is on the angle bisector.Wait, is that true? Let me think.Since D is the midpoint of arc BC, the angle BDC is equal to half the measure of arc BAC. Wait, no, the measure of angle BDC is equal to half the measure of arc BC not containing D. Wait, since D is the midpoint of arc BC, the measure of arc BD and arc DC are equal, each being half of arc BC.Wait, perhaps I need to recall that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at the circumference. So, angle BDC is equal to half the measure of arc BC.But arc BC is equal to 2 times angle BAC, because in the circumcircle, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. Wait, no, angle BAC is the inscribed angle subtended by arc BC, so arc BC is 2 * angle BAC.Therefore, angle BDC, which is subtended by arc BC at point D, is equal to half of arc BC, which is angle BAC.Wait, so angle BDC = angle BAC.But angle BAC is being bisected by AD, so angle BAD = angle CAD = angle BAC / 2.Hmm, interesting. So, angle BDC = angle BAC.Is there a way to relate this to triangle IDC?Alternatively, maybe we can consider triangle AID. Hmm, not sure.Wait, another thought: the distance from the incenter I to point D can be expressed using the formula involving the circumradius R and other triangle parameters.Wait, I recall that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by sqrt(R(R - 2r)). But here, D is a point on the circumcircle, not the circumradius.Wait, maybe we can use the formula for the distance between two points on the circumcircle. But I don't know the position of I relative to the circumcircle.Alternatively, maybe we can use trigonometric identities in triangle IDC.Wait, let me think again. In triangle IDC, we have ID = n, IC = sqrt(r^2 + (s - c)^2), and DC is the side we need to find. If we can find angle IDC, then we can apply the Law of Cosines.So, angle IDC is equal to angle between ID and IC. How can we find this angle?Alternatively, maybe we can express angle IDC in terms of other angles in the triangle.Wait, since D is the midpoint of arc BC, and I is the incenter, perhaps there is a known relationship between angle IDC and other angles.Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the incenter I lies inside the triangle, and D is on the circumcircle. So, maybe we can express the coordinates of I and D in some coordinate system and compute the distance.Wait, perhaps using trigonometric coordinates. Let me consider placing triangle ABC in a coordinate system where the circumcircle is centered at the origin with radius R. Then, points A, B, C, D lie on the circle of radius R.Let me denote the coordinates as follows:Let me set point A at (R, 0). Then, points B and C can be placed at angles corresponding to their positions on the circumcircle. Let me denote angle BAC as 2α, so that the angle bisector divides it into two angles of α each.Since D is the midpoint of arc BC, which doesn't contain A, the arc BC is equal to 2 times angle BAC, which is 4α. Therefore, arc BD and arc DC are each 2α.Wait, actually, in a triangle, the measure of arc BC is equal to 2 times angle BAC. So, if angle BAC is 2α, then arc BC is 4α, so arc BD and arc DC are each 2α.Therefore, the central angles for arcs BD and DC are each 2α.So, if I place point A at (R, 0), then point D would be located at an angle of π - 2α from point A, since it's the midpoint of arc BC opposite to A.Wait, maybe not exactly, but let me think.Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the positions of B and C.Let me denote the central angles for points B and C as θ and -θ, respectively, so that arc BC is 2θ. Then, since D is the midpoint of arc BC, it would be at angle 0, but that might conflict with point A. Hmm, maybe not.Wait, perhaps it's better to use complex numbers for coordinates.Let me represent the circumcircle as the unit circle in the complex plane, with center at the origin. Let me denote point A as 1 (on the real axis). Then, points B and C can be represented as complex numbers e^{iβ} and e^{-iβ}, respectively, so that arc BC is 2β. Then, the midpoint D of arc BC (which doesn't contain A) would be at angle 0, but that's the same as point A. Hmm, that can't be.Wait, maybe I need to adjust the angles. Let me think.If I place point A at angle 0, then points B and C can be placed symmetrically around the real axis, say at angles γ and -γ. Then, the arc BC would be 2γ, and the midpoint of arc BC not containing A would be at angle π, which is diametrically opposite to A. So, point D would be at (-1, 0) in the complex plane.Wait, that might be a good approach. So, let me set up the circumcircle as the unit circle, with point A at (1,0), point D at (-1,0), and points B and C symmetric with respect to the real axis at angles γ and -γ.So, point B is e^{iγ} and point C is e^{-iγ}. Then, the angle at A is angle BAC, which is equal to the angle between vectors AB and AC.Since points B and C are at angles γ and -γ, the angle BAC is 2γ.Therefore, the angle bisector of angle A (which is 2γ) will split it into two angles of γ each. So, the angle bisector will make an angle of γ with the real axis.But since point D is at (-1,0), which is diametrically opposite to A, the angle bisector from A passes through D. So, in this configuration, the angle bisector of angle A is the line from (1,0) through (-1,0), which is the real axis.Therefore, in this coordinate system, the angle bisector is the real axis, and point D is at (-1,0).Now, the incenter I of triangle ABC. Since the triangle is symmetric with respect to the real axis, the incenter must lie on the real axis. So, its coordinates are (h, 0) for some h between 0 and 1.Wait, actually, in this symmetric case, the incenter lies on the real axis. So, I can compute its coordinates.Given that points B and C are at e^{iγ} and e^{-iγ}, and point A is at (1,0). Let me compute the inradius and the coordinates of I.First, let's compute the side lengths.The length AB is the distance between (1,0) and e^{iγ}. Using the chord length formula, it's 2 sin(γ/2). Similarly, AC is also 2 sin(γ/2). The length BC is the distance between e^{iγ} and e^{-iγ}, which is 2 sin γ.So, sides:AB = AC = 2 sin(γ/2)BC = 2 sin γTherefore, the semiperimeter s is:s = (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (2 sin(γ/2) + 2 sin(γ/2) + 2 sin γ)/2 = (4 sin(γ/2) + 2 sin γ)/2 = 2 sin(γ/2) + sin γThe area of triangle ABC can be computed using the formula (1/2)ab sin C. Here, sides AB and AC are equal, so it's an isoceles triangle. The area is (1/2)*AB*AC*sin(angle BAC).Angle BAC is 2γ, so area = (1/2)*(2 sin(γ/2))^2 * sin(2γ) = (1/2)*(4 sin²(γ/2)) * sin(2γ) = 2 sin²(γ/2) * sin(2γ)Alternatively, since the triangle is inscribed in the unit circle, the area can also be computed as (abc)/(4R), where R is the circumradius. Here, R = 1, so area = (AB * AC * BC)/4 = (2 sin(γ/2) * 2 sin(γ/2) * 2 sin γ)/4 = (8 sin²(γ/2) sin γ)/4 = 2 sin²(γ/2) sin γ. So, same as before.Therefore, the inradius r = area / s = [2 sin²(γ/2) sin γ] / [2 sin(γ/2) + sin γ]Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: 2 sin²(γ/2) sin γDenominator: 2 sin(γ/2) + sin γLet me factor sin γ in the denominator:Denominator: sin γ + 2 sin(γ/2) = 2 sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2) + 2 sin(γ/2) = 2 sin(γ/2)(cos(γ/2) + 1)So, r = [2 sin²(γ/2) sin γ] / [2 sin(γ/2)(cos(γ/2) + 1)] = [sin²(γ/2) sin γ] / [sin(γ/2)(cos(γ/2) + 1)] = [sin(γ/2) sin γ] / [cos(γ/2) + 1]Simplify sin γ = 2 sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2):So, r = [sin(γ/2) * 2 sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2)] / [cos(γ/2) + 1] = [2 sin²(γ/2) cos(γ/2)] / [cos(γ/2) + 1]Factor numerator and denominator:Let me factor out cos(γ/2) + 1 from the numerator:Wait, 2 sin²(γ/2) cos(γ/2) = 2 sin²(γ/2) cos(γ/2)Hmm, perhaps I can write sin²(γ/2) as (1 - cos γ)/2:Wait, sin²(γ/2) = (1 - cos γ)/2So, r = [2 * (1 - cos γ)/2 * cos(γ/2)] / [cos(γ/2) + 1] = [(1 - cos γ) cos(γ/2)] / [cos(γ/2) + 1]Note that 1 - cos γ = 2 sin²(γ/2), so:r = [2 sin²(γ/2) cos(γ/2)] / [cos(γ/2) + 1]Wait, this seems similar to what I had before. Maybe I can factor out cos(γ/2) + 1 in the numerator:Let me write 2 sin²(γ/2) cos(γ/2) = 2 sin²(γ/2) cos(γ/2)Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me write cos(γ/2) + 1 = 2 cos²(γ/4), using the identity 1 + cos θ = 2 cos²(θ/2). So, cos(γ/2) + 1 = 2 cos²(γ/4)Similarly, sin²(γ/2) = 4 sin²(γ/4) cos²(γ/4)Wait, maybe not helpful.Alternatively, let me write r in terms of t = γ/2. Then, r = [2 sin² t cos t] / [cos t + 1]Let me factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: 2 sin² t cos tDenominator: cos t + 1Let me write numerator as 2 sin² t cos t = 2 sin t * sin t cos t = 2 sin t * (sin t cos t) = 2 sin t * (1/2 sin 2t) = sin t sin 2tWait, not sure.Alternatively, let me divide numerator and denominator by cos t + 1:r = [2 sin² t cos t] / [cos t + 1] = [2 sin² t cos t] / [cos t + 1]Let me perform polynomial division or factor:Let me write 2 sin² t cos t = 2 (1 - cos² t) cos t = 2 cos t - 2 cos³ tSo, numerator: 2 cos t - 2 cos³ tDenominator: cos t + 1So, let's divide 2 cos t - 2 cos³ t by cos t + 1.Let me write numerator as -2 cos³ t + 2 cos tFactor out -2 cos t: -2 cos t (cos² t - 1) = -2 cos t (-sin² t) = 2 cos t sin² tWait, that's going back. Alternatively, perform polynomial division:Divide -2 cos³ t + 2 cos t by cos t + 1.Let me write it as:Divide (-2 cos³ t + 0 cos² t + 2 cos t + 0) by (cos t + 1).Using polynomial long division:First term: -2 cos³ t divided by cos t is -2 cos² t.Multiply divisor by -2 cos² t: (-2 cos² t)(cos t + 1) = -2 cos³ t - 2 cos² tSubtract from dividend:(-2 cos³ t + 0 cos² t + 2 cos t + 0) - (-2 cos³ t - 2 cos² t) = 0 + 2 cos² t + 2 cos tNext term: 2 cos² t divided by cos t is 2 cos t.Multiply divisor by 2 cos t: 2 cos t (cos t + 1) = 2 cos² t + 2 cos tSubtract:(2 cos² t + 2 cos t) - (2 cos² t + 2 cos t) = 0So, the division yields -2 cos² t + 2 cos t with no remainder.Therefore, r = (-2 cos² t + 2 cos t) = 2 cos t (1 - cos t)But t = γ/2, so:r = 2 cos(γ/2) (1 - cos(γ/2)) = 2 cos(γ/2) - 2 cos²(γ/2)Hmm, that's an expression for r.But I'm not sure if this is helpful yet.Wait, in this coordinate system, the incenter I is on the real axis at (h, 0). Let me find h.In barycentric coordinates, the incenter is at (a : b : c), but in our case, since it's symmetric, it's on the real axis.Alternatively, since the triangle is isoceles with AB = AC, the incenter lies on the axis of symmetry, which is the real axis.So, in coordinates, I is at (h, 0). Let me compute h.In an isoceles triangle with AB = AC, the inradius can be found, and the coordinates of the incenter can be determined.Wait, in a triangle with coordinates A(1,0), B(e^{iγ}), C(e^{-iγ}), the incenter I is located at (h,0). Let me compute h.In a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side. Since the triangle is symmetric, the inradius is the distance from I to side BC.But side BC is the chord between points B and C, which are at angles γ and -γ. The equation of line BC can be found, and then the distance from (h,0) to this line is equal to r.Alternatively, since the triangle is isoceles, the inradius can be found using the formula r = (area)/s, which we already have.But maybe it's easier to compute h in terms of γ.Wait, in a triangle, the coordinates of the incenter can be found as a weighted average. Since the triangle is isoceles, the incenter lies on the real axis, so its y-coordinate is 0, and x-coordinate is h.Given that, the inradius is the distance from I to side BC. Let me compute that.First, find the equation of line BC.Points B and C are at e^{iγ} and e^{-iγ}, which in coordinates are (cos γ, sin γ) and (cos γ, -sin γ). So, the line BC connects these two points.The slope of BC is [ -sin γ - sin γ ] / [ cos γ - cos γ ] = (-2 sin γ)/0, which is undefined. So, line BC is vertical, at x = cos γ.Therefore, the distance from point I(h,0) to line BC is |h - cos γ|.But this distance is equal to the inradius r.So, |h - cos γ| = r => h = cos γ ± rBut since I is inside the triangle, and in our coordinate system, the triangle is between x = 1 and x = cos γ (since points B and C are at x = cos γ). So, h must be between cos γ and 1.Therefore, h = cos γ + r, because h > cos γ.Wait, but the distance from I to BC is r, which is |h - cos γ|. Since h > cos γ, h = cos γ + r.But wait, actually, in our coordinate system, the inradius is the distance from I to BC, which is |h - cos γ|. Since I is inside the triangle, and the triangle is on the right side of BC (since A is at (1,0)), h must be greater than cos γ, so h = cos γ + r.Wait, but in reality, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to side BC, which is |h - cos γ|. So, if h > cos γ, then h - cos γ = r. Therefore, h = cos γ + r.But in our case, the inradius r is the distance from I to BC, which is h - cos γ.Wait, but earlier, we had r = [2 sin²(γ/2) sin γ] / [2 sin(γ/2) + sin γ], which we simplified to 2 cos(γ/2)(1 - cos(γ/2)).So, h = cos γ + r = cos γ + 2 cos(γ/2)(1 - cos(γ/2))Hmm, let me compute this.First, cos γ can be written as 2 cos²(γ/2) - 1.So, h = 2 cos²(γ/2) - 1 + 2 cos(γ/2)(1 - cos(γ/2)) = 2 cos²(γ/2) - 1 + 2 cos(γ/2) - 2 cos²(γ/2) = (2 cos²(γ/2) - 2 cos²(γ/2)) + 2 cos(γ/2) - 1 = 2 cos(γ/2) - 1So, h = 2 cos(γ/2) - 1Therefore, the incenter I is at (2 cos(γ/2) - 1, 0)Now, point D is at (-1, 0). So, the distance between I and D is |h - (-1)| = |2 cos(γ/2) - 1 + 1| = |2 cos(γ/2)| = 2 |cos(γ/2)|But since γ is an angle in a triangle, γ/2 is between 0 and π/2, so cos(γ/2) is positive. Therefore, ID = 2 cos(γ/2)But the problem states that ID = n. So, 2 cos(γ/2) = n => cos(γ/2) = n/2Therefore, γ/2 = arccos(n/2) => γ = 2 arccos(n/2)Now, we need to find DC.Point D is at (-1,0), point C is at (cos γ, -sin γ). So, the distance DC is the distance between (-1,0) and (cos γ, -sin γ).Compute DC:DC = sqrt[ (cos γ - (-1))² + (-sin γ - 0)² ] = sqrt[ (cos γ + 1)² + sin² γ ]Simplify:= sqrt[ cos² γ + 2 cos γ + 1 + sin² γ ] = sqrt[ (cos² γ + sin² γ) + 2 cos γ + 1 ] = sqrt[ 1 + 2 cos γ + 1 ] = sqrt[ 2 + 2 cos γ ] = sqrt[ 2(1 + cos γ) ] = sqrt[ 2 * 2 cos²(γ/2) ] = sqrt[4 cos²(γ/2)] = 2 |cos(γ/2)|Again, since γ/2 is between 0 and π/2, cos(γ/2) is positive, so DC = 2 cos(γ/2)But earlier, we found that 2 cos(γ/2) = n. Therefore, DC = nWait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, DC = 2 cos(γ/2) = n, so DC = n.Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps.We had ID = 2 cos(γ/2) = n, so DC = 2 cos(γ/2) = n. So, DC = n.But the problem states that the incenter is at distance n from D, so DC is equal to n. Therefore, the length of chord DC is n.Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me verify.In our coordinate system, we placed the circumradius as 1, but in reality, the circumradius R is not necessarily 1. Wait, hold on! I assumed the circumradius was 1 for simplicity, but in reality, the circumradius could be any value. So, in my coordinate system, I set R = 1, but in the actual problem, R is not given.Therefore, my result DC = n is only valid when R = 1. But in the general case, we need to express DC in terms of R and n.Wait, so let me adjust for that.In my coordinate system, I set R = 1, but in reality, R is arbitrary. So, all lengths scale by R. So, in my coordinate system, DC = n, but in reality, DC = n * R.But wait, in my coordinate system, ID = n, but in reality, ID = n * R as well. Wait, no, in my coordinate system, I set R = 1, so ID = n corresponds to n * R in the actual problem.Wait, perhaps I need to express DC in terms of R and n.Wait, in my coordinate system, R = 1, and I found that DC = n. So, in the general case, DC = n * R.But I don't know R. Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.Wait, but in my coordinate system, R = 1, and I found that DC = n. Therefore, in general, DC = n * R.But I need to express DC in terms of n, without R. So, perhaps I can relate R and n.Wait, in my coordinate system, R = 1, and ID = n. So, in the general case, ID = n = 2 R cos(γ/2). Therefore, R = n / (2 cos(γ/2))But DC = 2 R cos(γ/2) = 2 * (n / (2 cos(γ/2))) * cos(γ/2) = nWait, so DC = n regardless of R. So, in the general case, DC = n.Wait, that seems to be the case. So, in my coordinate system, with R = 1, DC = n. In the general case, DC = n as well.Wait, that seems counterintuitive. How can DC be equal to n, the distance from I to D, regardless of the triangle's size?Wait, but in my coordinate system, I set R = 1, but in reality, the distance ID is given as n, so scaling back, DC = n.Wait, perhaps it's correct. Let me think.In the coordinate system where R = 1, DC = n. So, in the general case, DC = n.Therefore, the length of chord DC is n.Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check with an example.Suppose n = 1. Then, DC = 1. But in my coordinate system, with R = 1, DC = n = 1, which is consistent.Alternatively, if n = 0, which would mean I = D, but in that case, DC would be zero, which is also consistent.Wait, but in reality, n cannot be zero because I is inside the triangle, and D is on the circumcircle, so they can't coincide unless the triangle is degenerate.But in the formula, DC = n, so if n = 0, DC = 0, which would imply D = C, but in reality, D is the midpoint of arc BC, so unless the triangle is degenerate, D cannot coincide with C.Hmm, maybe my coordinate system assumption is causing some issues.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the circumradius is 1. Let me try to redo the calculation without assuming R = 1.Let me denote the circumradius as R. So, in the coordinate system, point A is at (R, 0), point D is at (-R, 0), points B and C are at (R cos γ, R sin γ) and (R cos γ, -R sin γ).Then, the inradius r is given by area / semiperimeter.First, compute side lengths:AB = AC = 2 R sin(γ/2)BC = 2 R sin γSemiperimeter s = (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (4 R sin(γ/2) + 2 R sin γ)/2 = 2 R sin(γ/2) + R sin γArea = (1/2) AB * AC * sin(angle BAC) = (1/2)*(2 R sin(γ/2))^2 * sin(2γ) = 2 R² sin²(γ/2) sin(2γ)Alternatively, area = (abc)/(4R) = (AB * AC * BC)/(4R) = (2 R sin(γ/2) * 2 R sin(γ/2) * 2 R sin γ)/(4R) = (8 R³ sin²(γ/2) sin γ)/(4R) = 2 R² sin²(γ/2) sin γSo, area = 2 R² sin²(γ/2) sin γTherefore, inradius r = area / s = [2 R² sin²(γ/2) sin γ] / [2 R sin(γ/2) + R sin γ] = [2 R² sin²(γ/2) sin γ] / [R (2 sin(γ/2) + sin γ)] = [2 R sin²(γ/2) sin γ] / [2 sin(γ/2) + sin γ]Simplify denominator:2 sin(γ/2) + sin γ = 2 sin(γ/2) + 2 sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2) = 2 sin(γ/2)(1 + cos(γ/2))So, r = [2 R sin²(γ/2) sin γ] / [2 sin(γ/2)(1 + cos(γ/2))] = [R sin(γ/2) sin γ] / [1 + cos(γ/2)]Express sin γ as 2 sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2):r = [R sin(γ/2) * 2 sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2)] / [1 + cos(γ/2)] = [2 R sin²(γ/2) cos(γ/2)] / [1 + cos(γ/2)]Factor numerator:2 R sin²(γ/2) cos(γ/2) = 2 R sin(γ/2) * sin(γ/2) cos(γ/2) = 2 R sin(γ/2) * (1/2) sin γ = R sin(γ/2) sin γWait, not sure. Alternatively, factor out 1 + cos(γ/2):Wait, 1 + cos(γ/2) = 2 cos²(γ/4), so:r = [2 R sin²(γ/2) cos(γ/2)] / [2 cos²(γ/4)] = [R sin²(γ/2) cos(γ/2)] / [cos²(γ/4)]But sin(γ/2) = 2 sin(γ/4) cos(γ/4), so:r = [R (2 sin(γ/4) cos(γ/4))² cos(γ/2)] / [cos²(γ/4)] = [R * 4 sin²(γ/4) cos²(γ/4) * cos(γ/2)] / [cos²(γ/4)] = 4 R sin²(γ/4) cos(γ/2)Hmm, not sure if helpful.Alternatively, let me compute the coordinates of I.In this scaled coordinate system, point I is at (h, 0), where h = R (2 cos(γ/2) - 1)Wait, earlier in the R = 1 case, h = 2 cos(γ/2) - 1. So, scaling by R, h = R (2 cos(γ/2) - 1)Therefore, the incenter I is at (R (2 cos(γ/2) - 1), 0)Point D is at (-R, 0). So, the distance ID is |h - (-R)| = |R (2 cos(γ/2) - 1) + R| = |R (2 cos(γ/2) - 1 + 1)| = |R * 2 cos(γ/2)| = 2 R cos(γ/2)Given that ID = n, so 2 R cos(γ/2) = n => R cos(γ/2) = n / 2Now, compute DC.Point D is at (-R, 0), point C is at (R cos γ, -R sin γ)Distance DC:sqrt[ (R cos γ - (-R))² + (-R sin γ - 0)² ] = sqrt[ (R cos γ + R)² + (R sin γ)^2 ] = sqrt[ R² (cos γ + 1)^2 + R² sin² γ ] = R sqrt[ (cos γ + 1)^2 + sin² γ ]Simplify inside the sqrt:(cos γ + 1)^2 + sin² γ = cos² γ + 2 cos γ + 1 + sin² γ = (cos² γ + sin² γ) + 2 cos γ + 1 = 1 + 2 cos γ + 1 = 2 + 2 cos γ = 2(1 + cos γ)Therefore, DC = R sqrt[2(1 + cos γ)] = R sqrt[2 * 2 cos²(γ/2)] = R sqrt[4 cos²(γ/2)] = R * 2 |cos(γ/2)|Since γ/2 is between 0 and π/2, cos(γ/2) is positive, so DC = 2 R cos(γ/2)But from earlier, 2 R cos(γ/2) = n, so DC = nTherefore, regardless of the circumradius R, DC = nWow, so despite scaling, DC is equal to n.Therefore, the length of chord DC is n.That's the answer.**Final Answer**The length of chord ( DC ) is (boxed{n})."},{"question":"If the variance of a set of data 3, 3, 3, x is 0, then x=______.","answer":"First, I recognize that the variance of a dataset being zero implies that all the data points are identical.

When dividing Ana's result by the smaller of the two numbers she should have multiplied, the quotient is 288 and the remainder is 67. What are the two numbers that Ana multiplied?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Ana multiplies two positive integers, and their difference is 202. But she makes a mistake and gets a number that's 1000 units less than the correct result. Then, when you divide Ana's result by the smaller number, the quotient is 288 and the remainder is 67. I need to find the two numbers she multiplied.Let me break this down step by step. First, let's denote the two numbers. Since their difference is 202, I can call the smaller number ( x ) and the larger one ( x + 202 ). So, the correct product should be ( x(x + 202) ).But Ana made a mistake and got a number that's 1000 less. So, her result is ( x(x + 202) - 1000 ).Now, the problem also says that when Ana's result is divided by the smaller number ( x ), the quotient is 288 and the remainder is 67. That means:( text{Ana's result} = 288x + 67 )But we also know that Ana's result is ( x(x + 202) - 1000 ). So, we can set up the equation:( x(x + 202) - 1000 = 288x + 67 )Let me write that out:( x^2 + 202x - 1000 = 288x + 67 )Hmm, okay, let's bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:( x^2 + 202x - 1000 - 288x - 67 = 0 )Combine like terms:( x^2 + (202x - 288x) + (-1000 - 67) = 0 )Calculating the coefficients:202x - 288x = -86x-1000 - 67 = -1067So, the equation becomes:( x^2 - 86x - 1067 = 0 )Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation for x. Let me see if it factors nicely. The quadratic is ( x^2 - 86x - 1067 ). I need two numbers that multiply to -1067 and add up to -86. Hmm, 1067 is a prime number? Let me check.Wait, 1067 divided by 11 is 97, because 11*97 is 1067. So, 1067 is 11*97. So, the factors are 11 and 97. Since the product is negative, one is positive and the other is negative. So, which combination gives me -86 when added?Let me try 97 and -11. 97 - 11 = 86. But since the middle term is -86x, so maybe -97 and +11? Let's see: -97 + 11 = -86. Yes, that works.So, the quadratic factors as:( (x - 97)(x + 11) = 0 )So, the solutions are x = 97 or x = -11. But since we're dealing with positive integers, x must be 97.Therefore, the smaller number is 97, and the larger number is 97 + 202 = 299.Let me verify this to make sure.First, the correct product is 97 * 299. Let me compute that:97 * 300 would be 29,100, so subtract 97 to get 29,100 - 97 = 29,003.Ana's result is 1000 less, so 29,003 - 1000 = 28,003.Now, dividing Ana's result by the smaller number, 97:28,003 ÷ 97. Let's see, 97 * 288 = ?97 * 200 = 19,40097 * 80 = 7,76097 * 8 = 776Adding those together: 19,400 + 7,760 = 27,160; 27,160 + 776 = 27,936.But Ana's result is 28,003, so 28,003 - 27,936 = 67. So, the remainder is 67. That matches the problem statement.Therefore, the two numbers are 97 and 299.**Final Answer**The two numbers are boxed{97} and boxed{299}."},{"question":"If a solution to the equation ax-3y=0 in terms of x and y is also a solution to the system of equations left{begin{array}{l}{x+y=1}{2x+y=0}end{array}right., then the value of a is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If a solution to the equation ( ax - 3y = 0 ) in terms of ( x ) and ( y ) is also a solution to the system of equations [begin{cases}x + y = 1 2x + y = 0end{cases}]then I need to find the value of ( a ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that if a solution satisfies both the equation ( ax - 3y = 0 ) and the system of equations, then that solution must satisfy all three equations simultaneously. So, maybe I should first solve the system of equations to find the values of ( x ) and ( y ), and then plug those into the equation ( ax - 3y = 0 ) to find ( a ).Alright, let's start by solving the system:1. ( x + y = 1 )2. ( 2x + y = 0 )I can use either substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here. If I subtract the first equation from the second, I can eliminate ( y ).So, subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:( (2x + y) - (x + y) = 0 - 1 )Simplify:( 2x + y - x - y = -1 )Which simplifies to:( x = -1 )Okay, so ( x = -1 ). Now, plug this back into one of the equations to find ( y ). Let's use equation 1:( (-1) + y = 1 )So, ( y = 1 + 1 = 2 )Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check. If ( x = -1 ), then plugging into equation 1:( (-1) + y = 1 ) implies ( y = 2 ). Hmm, okay. Let me check with equation 2 to make sure.Equation 2: ( 2(-1) + y = 0 ) which is ( -2 + y = 0 ), so ( y = 2 ). Okay, that's consistent. So, the solution to the system is ( x = -1 ) and ( y = 2 ).Now, since this solution also satisfies the equation ( ax - 3y = 0 ), I can substitute ( x = -1 ) and ( y = 2 ) into this equation to find ( a ).So, substituting:( a(-1) - 3(2) = 0 )Simplify:( -a - 6 = 0 )Now, solving for ( a ):( -a = 6 )Multiply both sides by -1:( a = -6 )Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, plugging ( x = -1 ) and ( y = 2 ) into ( ax - 3y = 0 ):( a(-1) - 3(2) = 0 )Which is ( -a - 6 = 0 ), so ( -a = 6 ), hence ( a = -6 ). That seems correct.Just to double-check, if ( a = -6 ), then the equation becomes ( -6x - 3y = 0 ). Let's see if ( x = -1 ) and ( y = 2 ) satisfy this:Left-hand side: ( -6(-1) - 3(2) = 6 - 6 = 0 ). Yep, that works. So, the value of ( a ) is indeed -6.I think that's it. I solved the system to find ( x ) and ( y ), then substituted into the given equation to find ( a ). Everything checks out.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{-6}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)= begin{cases} x-2,x > 0  -x^{2}+bx+c,xleqslant 0 end{cases} satisfies f(0)=1 and f(0)+2f(-1)=0, then the function g(x)=f(x)+x has ___ ___ number of zeros.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise. It's x - 2 when x is greater than 0, and it's -x² + bx + c when x is less than or equal to 0. I need to find the number of zeros for the function g(x) = f(x) + x. First, let me write down what I know. The function f(x) has two cases: one for x > 0 and another for x ≤ 0. The problem gives me two conditions: f(0) = 1 and f(0) + 2f(-1) = 0. I think I can use these conditions to find the values of b and c in the quadratic part of f(x).Starting with f(0) = 1. Since 0 is less than or equal to 0, I should use the second case of the function, which is -x² + bx + c. Plugging in x = 0, we get:f(0) = -(0)² + b*(0) + c = cSo, f(0) = c = 1. That means c is 1. Got that.Next, the second condition is f(0) + 2f(-1) = 0. We already know f(0) is 1, so plugging that in:1 + 2f(-1) = 0So, 2f(-1) = -1, which means f(-1) = -1/2.Now, let's find f(-1). Since -1 is less than or equal to 0, we use the quadratic part again:f(-1) = -(-1)² + b*(-1) + cCalculating each term:-(-1)² = -1 (because (-1)² is 1, and the negative of that is -1)b*(-1) = -bc is 1, as we found earlier.So, f(-1) = -1 - b + 1. Simplify that:-1 + 1 cancels out, so f(-1) = -bBut we know f(-1) is -1/2, so:-b = -1/2Multiply both sides by -1:b = 1/2Alright, so now we have both b and c. b is 1/2 and c is 1. So the function f(x) is:f(x) = {    x - 2, x > 0    -x² + (1/2)x + 1, x ≤ 0}Now, the function g(x) is defined as f(x) + x. So let me write that out:g(x) = f(x) + xSo, for x > 0, f(x) is x - 2, so:g(x) = (x - 2) + x = 2x - 2For x ≤ 0, f(x) is -x² + (1/2)x + 1, so:g(x) = (-x² + (1/2)x + 1) + x = -x² + (3/2)x + 1So, g(x) is a piecewise function:g(x) = {    2x - 2, x > 0    -x² + (3/2)x + 1, x ≤ 0}Now, I need to find the number of zeros of g(x). That is, find how many times g(x) crosses the x-axis. To do this, I'll analyze each piece separately and then see if there are any overlaps or additional considerations.First, let's consider x > 0:g(x) = 2x - 2Set this equal to zero:2x - 2 = 02x = 2x = 1So, for x > 0, g(x) has a zero at x = 1. That's straightforward.Now, let's consider x ≤ 0:g(x) = -x² + (3/2)x + 1Set this equal to zero:-x² + (3/2)x + 1 = 0I can multiply both sides by -1 to make it a standard quadratic:x² - (3/2)x - 1 = 0Alternatively, to make it easier, I can write it as:x² - (3/2)x - 1 = 0But maybe it's better to keep it as is. Let me write it as:-x² + (3/2)x + 1 = 0Multiply both sides by -1:x² - (3/2)x - 1 = 0Now, let's solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)Here, a = 1, b = -3/2, c = -1.So, discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-3/2)² - 4*1*(-1) = (9/4) + 4 = (9/4) + (16/4) = 25/4Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real roots.So, x = [3/2 ± sqrt(25/4)] / 2sqrt(25/4) is 5/2, so:x = [3/2 ± 5/2] / 2Calculating both roots:First root: [3/2 + 5/2] / 2 = (8/2)/2 = 4/2 = 2Second root: [3/2 - 5/2] / 2 = (-2/2)/2 = (-1)/2 = -1/2So, the solutions are x = 2 and x = -1/2.But wait, in this case, we're solving for x ≤ 0. So x = 2 is not in the domain we're considering here (since 2 > 0). Therefore, the only solution in x ≤ 0 is x = -1/2.Therefore, g(x) has a zero at x = -1/2 for x ≤ 0, and another zero at x = 1 for x > 0.So, in total, g(x) has two zeros: one at x = -1/2 and another at x = 1.But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in solving the quadratic.Original equation for x ≤ 0: -x² + (3/2)x + 1 = 0Multiply by -1: x² - (3/2)x - 1 = 0Then, discriminant D = ( -3/2 )² - 4*1*(-1) = 9/4 + 4 = 25/4, which is correct.Solutions: [3/2 ± 5/2]/2First solution: (3/2 + 5/2)/2 = (8/2)/2 = 4/2 = 2Second solution: (3/2 - 5/2)/2 = (-2/2)/2 = (-1)/2 = -1/2Yes, that's correct. So, only x = -1/2 is in the domain x ≤ 0.Therefore, g(x) has two zeros: x = -1/2 and x = 1.Wait, but hold on. Let me check if x = -1/2 is indeed a zero.Plugging x = -1/2 into g(x):g(-1/2) = -(-1/2)² + (3/2)*(-1/2) + 1Calculate each term:-(-1/2)² = -(1/4) = -1/4(3/2)*(-1/2) = -3/4So, adding them up: -1/4 - 3/4 + 1 = (-1 - 3)/4 + 1 = (-4)/4 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0Yes, that's correct. So x = -1/2 is a zero.Similarly, for x = 1:g(1) = 2*1 - 2 = 0, which is correct.So, both zeros are valid.Wait, but hold on again. Let me check if there's any other zero at x = 0.Because sometimes, the point where the function changes definition can be a zero.So, let's compute g(0):g(0) = f(0) + 0 = f(0) = 1, as given.So, g(0) = 1, which is not zero.Therefore, there's no zero at x = 0.So, in total, g(x) has two zeros: one at x = -1/2 and another at x = 1.Therefore, the number of zeros is two.Wait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that the quadratic part could have another zero in x ≤ 0?We found x = -1/2 as a solution, but x = 2 is not in the domain. So, only x = -1/2 is a zero in x ≤ 0.And in x > 0, only x = 1 is a zero.Therefore, total zeros are two.But just to make sure, let me graph the function mentally.For x > 0, g(x) is a straight line with slope 2, starting from (0, g(0)) which is (0,1). So, at x = 0, it's 1, and it goes up with slope 2. It crosses zero at x = 1.For x ≤ 0, it's a quadratic function: -x² + (3/2)x + 1. Since the coefficient of x² is negative, it's a downward opening parabola. The vertex is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a = -1, b = 3/2.Wait, vertex x-coordinate is -b/(2a) = -(3/2)/(2*(-1)) = -(3/2)/(-2) = (3/2)/2 = 3/4. But 3/4 is positive, so the vertex is at x = 3/4, which is in the x > 0 region. But since we're only considering x ≤ 0 for this part, the maximum point of the parabola is at x = 3/4, which is outside our domain.Therefore, in the domain x ≤ 0, the quadratic is decreasing because the vertex is at x = 3/4, which is to the right of x = 0. So, from x = 0 going left, the function is decreasing.At x = 0, g(0) = 1. As x decreases, the function decreases. It crosses zero at x = -1/2.So, yes, only one zero in x ≤ 0.Therefore, overall, two zeros.Wait, but let me confirm if the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis more than once in x ≤ 0. Since the quadratic equation only gave us one solution in x ≤ 0, which is x = -1/2, and the other solution is x = 2, which is outside the domain. So, only one zero in x ≤ 0.Therefore, the total number of zeros is two.So, the answer should be two.But just to make sure, let me check the behavior of the function.For x > 0: g(x) = 2x - 2. It's a straight line starting at (0, -2) but wait, no. Wait, at x = 0, g(0) is f(0) + 0 = 1. But for x > 0, g(x) is 2x - 2. So, at x = 0, it's 2*0 - 2 = -2, but wait, that contradicts with g(0) = 1.Wait, hold on, that can't be. There must be a mistake here.Wait, no, because g(x) is defined as f(x) + x. For x > 0, f(x) is x - 2, so g(x) = (x - 2) + x = 2x - 2. So, at x = 0, if we approach from the right, g(x) approaches 2*0 - 2 = -2, but g(0) is defined as f(0) + 0 = 1. So, there's a jump discontinuity at x = 0.So, the function g(x) is not continuous at x = 0. So, when x approaches 0 from the right, g(x) approaches -2, but g(0) is 1. So, the function jumps from 1 at x = 0 to approaching -2 as x approaches 0 from the right.Similarly, for x approaching 0 from the left, g(x) is the quadratic part: -x² + (3/2)x + 1. So, as x approaches 0 from the left, g(x) approaches 1, which matches g(0) = 1.So, the function is continuous from the left at x = 0, but not from the right.Therefore, the graph of g(x) has a jump at x = 0.So, for x > 0, it's a straight line starting just below (0, -2) and going upwards with slope 2, crossing zero at x = 1.For x ≤ 0, it's a downward opening parabola with vertex at x = 3/4 (outside the domain), so in x ≤ 0, it's decreasing from (0,1) to the left, crossing zero at x = -1/2.Therefore, the function g(x) crosses the x-axis twice: once at x = -1/2 and once at x = 1.Hence, the number of zeros is two.I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.**Final Answer**The function ( g(x) ) has boxed{2} zeros."},{"question":"The younger sister, Emma, has been exploring different historical periods and plans to organize her newly found historical knowledge into a timeline.

They position themselves at the points with coordinates (0,0),(1,0), and (0,1). Every minute, one of the three friends moves somewhere along the line parallel to the line passing through the positions of the other two friends. Can they reach the coordinates (0,0),(1,1),(0,2)?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where three friends are positioned at the points (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1). Every minute, one of them moves along a line that's parallel to the line passing through the other two friends' current positions. The question is whether they can reach the coordinates (0,0), (1,1), and (0,2). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.First, let me visualize the initial positions. We have one friend at the origin, another at (1,0), and the third at (0,1). So, they form a right-angled triangle with legs of length 1. Now, the goal is to get them to (0,0), (1,1), and (0,2). That would form a different triangle, also right-angled but with legs of lengths 1 and 2.The movement rule is that every minute, one friend moves along a line parallel to the line passing through the other two. So, if I pick one person to move, I have to figure out the direction they can move in based on the other two's positions.Let me denote the three friends as A, B, and C. Let's say A is at (0,0), B is at (1,0), and C is at (0,1). So initially, the line through B and C is from (1,0) to (0,1), which has a slope of (1-0)/(0-1) = -1. So, if A is to move, they have to move along a line parallel to this, which is also slope -1. So, A can move along the line y = -x + c. Since A is at (0,0), c would be 0, so A can move along y = -x. But wait, moving along y = -x from (0,0) would take A into the fourth quadrant, which might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe A can move in any direction parallel to BC, which is slope -1, so A can move along any line with slope -1, but starting from (0,0). So, points like (1,-1), (2,-2), etc., but also points like (-1,1), (-2,2), etc. Hmm, but moving to negative coordinates might complicate things. Maybe it's better to move in the positive direction.Alternatively, maybe I should consider moving another person first. Let's say I move B. The line through A and C is from (0,0) to (0,1), which is a vertical line. So, a line parallel to that would also be vertical. So, if B is at (1,0), moving along a vertical line would mean moving up or down along x=1. So, B can go to (1, y) where y is any real number. Similarly, if I move C, the line through A and B is from (0,0) to (1,0), which is horizontal. So, a line parallel to that is horizontal, so C can move along y=1, so to (x,1). So, C can go to (x,1) for any x.Hmm, so perhaps moving B or C is more flexible initially because they can move vertically or horizontally, which might be easier to reach the desired points.Let me think about the target positions: (0,0), (1,1), and (0,2). So, one person stays at (0,0), another moves to (1,1), and the third moves to (0,2). So, perhaps I need to move B from (1,0) to (1,1) or (1, something), and C from (0,1) to (0,2). Alternatively, maybe moving A somewhere else.Wait, but A is at (0,0). If I move A, as I thought earlier, it has to move along a line with slope -1. So, if A moves to (1,-1), that's one possibility, but that's moving away from the target. Alternatively, moving A to (-1,1), but again, that's moving away. Maybe not the best idea.Alternatively, maybe moving B first. If I move B vertically, from (1,0) to (1,1). Let's see if that's possible. So, moving B along the vertical line x=1. Since the line through A and C is vertical (from (0,0) to (0,1)), so moving B along a vertical line is allowed. So, moving B to (1,1) is possible in one move. Then, the new positions would be A at (0,0), B at (1,1), and C at (0,1).Now, from here, can we move C to (0,2)? Let's see. The line through A and B is from (0,0) to (1,1), which has a slope of 1. So, if we want to move C, we have to move along a line parallel to AB, which is slope 1. So, C is at (0,1). Moving along a line with slope 1 from (0,1) would be the line y = x + 1. So, C can move to any point along that line. To get to (0,2), that's not on y = x + 1, because plugging x=0, y=1. So, (0,2) is not on that line. So, moving C directly to (0,2) isn't possible in this step.Alternatively, maybe moving A. The line through B and C is from (1,1) to (0,1), which is a horizontal line y=1. So, moving A along a line parallel to that, which is horizontal. So, A can move along y=0, so from (0,0) to (x,0). But we need A to stay at (0,0), so maybe not moving A is better.Alternatively, maybe moving B again. The line through A and C is from (0,0) to (0,1), which is vertical. So, moving B along a vertical line again. B is at (1,1). So, moving along x=1, so up or down. If we move B up to (1,2), that might help. Then, the positions would be A at (0,0), B at (1,2), and C at (0,1).Now, can we move C to (0,2)? The line through A and B is from (0,0) to (1,2), which has a slope of 2. So, moving C along a line parallel to that, which is slope 2. C is at (0,1). So, the line would be y = 2x + 1. So, moving along that, can we reach (0,2)? Plugging x=0, y=1, so no, (0,2) isn't on that line. So, can't move C to (0,2) directly.Alternatively, maybe moving A. The line through B and C is from (1,2) to (0,1), which has a slope of (1-2)/(0-1) = (-1)/(-1) = 1. So, moving A along a line with slope 1. A is at (0,0), so the line is y = x. So, A can move to (1,1), but B is already at (1,2). Hmm, maybe moving A to (2,2), but that's getting further away. Alternatively, moving A to (-1,-1), but that's not helpful.Alternatively, maybe moving C. The line through A and B is from (0,0) to (1,2), slope 2. So, moving C along a line with slope 2. C is at (0,1), so the line is y = 2x + 1. So, moving along that, can we reach (0,2)? As before, no. Alternatively, moving C to (1,3), but that's not helpful.Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try a different sequence of moves.Starting again: A at (0,0), B at (1,0), C at (0,1).First, move C. The line through A and B is horizontal, so moving C along a horizontal line. C is at (0,1), so moving along y=1. So, C can go to (x,1). Let's say we move C to (1,1). Now, the positions are A at (0,0), B at (1,0), C at (1,1).Now, the line through A and C is from (0,0) to (1,1), slope 1. So, moving B along a line parallel to that, which is slope 1. B is at (1,0). So, the line is y = x - 1. So, moving B along that, can we get to (1,1)? Plugging x=1, y=0, so no. Alternatively, moving B to (2,1), but that's further away. Alternatively, moving B to (0,-1), which is not helpful.Alternatively, moving A. The line through B and C is from (1,0) to (1,1), which is vertical. So, moving A along a vertical line. A is at (0,0), so moving along x=0. So, A can go to (0,y). Let's move A to (0,1). But C is already at (1,1). Wait, no, C is at (1,1). So, moving A to (0,1) would mean two people are at (0,1), which isn't allowed, I think. Each person must occupy a unique point.Alternatively, moving A to (0,2). The line through B and C is vertical, so moving A along vertical line x=0. So, A can go to (0,2). Then, positions are A at (0,2), B at (1,0), C at (1,1).Now, can we move B to (1,1)? The line through A and C is from (0,2) to (1,1), slope (1-2)/(1-0) = -1. So, moving B along a line with slope -1. B is at (1,0). So, the line is y = -x + 1. So, moving along that, can we reach (1,1)? Plugging x=1, y=0, so no. Alternatively, moving B to (2,-1), which is not helpful.Alternatively, moving C. The line through A and B is from (0,2) to (1,0), slope (0-2)/(1-0) = -2. So, moving C along a line with slope -2. C is at (1,1). So, the line is y = -2x + 3. So, moving along that, can we reach (0,2)? Plugging x=0, y=3, which is not (0,2). Alternatively, moving C to (2,-1), which is not helpful.Hmm, this isn't working either. Maybe I need a different strategy.Let me think about the properties of the movement. Each move is along a line parallel to the line through the other two points. So, the direction of movement is determined by the other two points. Maybe I can model this as vectors or something.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the coordinates modulo something. For example, looking at the parity or something like that.Wait, let's consider the coordinates of the points. Initially, A is at (0,0), B at (1,0), C at (0,1). The target is A at (0,0), B at (1,1), C at (0,2). So, the differences are that B moves from (1,0) to (1,1), so y-coordinate increases by 1, and C moves from (0,1) to (0,2), y-coordinate increases by 1.So, maybe if I can find a way to increase the y-coordinates of B and C by 1 each, that would solve the problem.But how?Let me think about moving B first. If I move B vertically up to (1,1), as I did earlier, then from there, maybe I can move C.Wait, after moving B to (1,1), the line through A and C is from (0,0) to (0,1), which is vertical. So, moving C along a vertical line. C is at (0,1), so moving up to (0,2) is possible. Wait, is that allowed?Wait, if I move C, the line through A and B is from (0,0) to (1,1), which has a slope of 1. So, moving C along a line parallel to that, which is slope 1. But C is at (0,1). So, the line is y = x + 1. So, moving along that, can we reach (0,2)? No, because when x=0, y=1. So, (0,2) is not on that line.Wait, but if I move C vertically, is that allowed? Because the line through A and B is slope 1, so moving C along slope 1. So, no, moving vertically isn't allowed unless the line through A and B is vertical, which it isn't in this case.So, moving C vertically isn't an option when A and B are at (0,0) and (1,1). So, that approach doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe after moving B to (1,1), I can move A. The line through B and C is from (1,1) to (0,1), which is horizontal. So, moving A along a horizontal line. A is at (0,0), so moving along y=0. So, A can go to (x,0). But we need A to stay at (0,0), so maybe not moving A is better.Alternatively, maybe moving B again. The line through A and C is vertical, so moving B along vertical line x=1. So, moving B from (1,1) to (1,2). Now, positions are A at (0,0), B at (1,2), C at (0,1).Now, can we move C to (0,2)? The line through A and B is from (0,0) to (1,2), slope 2. So, moving C along a line with slope 2. C is at (0,1). So, the line is y = 2x + 1. So, moving along that, can we reach (0,2)? No, because when x=0, y=1. So, can't reach (0,2) directly.Alternatively, maybe moving A. The line through B and C is from (1,2) to (0,1), slope (1-2)/(0-1) = 1. So, moving A along a line with slope 1. A is at (0,0), so the line is y = x. So, moving A to (1,1), but B is at (1,2). So, maybe moving A to (2,2), but that's further away. Alternatively, moving A to (-1,-1), which isn't helpful.Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I need to consider more steps or a different sequence.Wait, let me try moving C first. From the initial positions, moving C along the line parallel to AB, which is horizontal. So, C can move from (0,1) to (x,1). Let's say we move C to (1,1). Now, positions are A at (0,0), B at (1,0), C at (1,1).Now, the line through A and C is from (0,0) to (1,1), slope 1. So, moving B along a line with slope 1. B is at (1,0). So, the line is y = x - 1. So, moving B along that, can we reach (1,1)? Plugging x=1, y=0, so no. Alternatively, moving B to (2,1), but that's further away. Alternatively, moving B to (0,-1), which isn't helpful.Alternatively, moving A. The line through B and C is from (1,0) to (1,1), which is vertical. So, moving A along a vertical line. A is at (0,0), so moving along x=0. So, A can go to (0,y). Let's move A to (0,1). But C is already at (1,1). Wait, no, C is at (1,1). So, moving A to (0,1) would mean two people are at (0,1), which isn't allowed. So, maybe moving A to (0,2). Then, positions are A at (0,2), B at (1,0), C at (1,1).Now, can we move B to (1,1)? The line through A and C is from (0,2) to (1,1), slope (1-2)/(1-0) = -1. So, moving B along a line with slope -1. B is at (1,0). So, the line is y = -x + 1. So, moving along that, can we reach (1,1)? Plugging x=1, y=0, so no. Alternatively, moving B to (2,-1), which isn't helpful.Alternatively, moving C. The line through A and B is from (0,2) to (1,0), slope (0-2)/(1-0) = -2. So, moving C along a line with slope -2. C is at (1,1). So, the line is y = -2x + 3. So, moving along that, can we reach (0,2)? Plugging x=0, y=3, which is not (0,2). Alternatively, moving C to (2,-1), which isn't helpful.Hmm, this isn't working either. Maybe I need to consider that it's not possible, but I'm not sure yet.Wait, let me think about the problem differently. Maybe I can model the positions as vectors and see if the target configuration is reachable through a series of allowed moves.Let me denote the positions as vectors: A = (0,0), B = (1,0), C = (0,1). The target is A' = (0,0), B' = (1,1), C' = (0,2).The movement rule is that each move, one point is translated by a vector parallel to the line through the other two points.So, for example, if I move A, the translation vector must be parallel to the line through B and C. Similarly for moving B or C.So, the translation vector for A would be a scalar multiple of (C - B) = (0,1) - (1,0) = (-1,1). So, A can be moved by any vector k*(-1,1), where k is a real number.Similarly, the translation vector for B would be parallel to (A - C) = (0,0) - (0,1) = (0,-1). So, B can be moved by any vector k*(0,-1).And the translation vector for C would be parallel to (A - B) = (0,0) - (1,0) = (-1,0). So, C can be moved by any vector k*(-1,0).Wait, that's interesting. So, initially, moving A can only change its position by multiples of (-1,1). Moving B can only change its y-coordinate (since the vector is (0,-1)). Moving C can only change its x-coordinate (since the vector is (-1,0)).So, let's see. If I move B, I can change its y-coordinate. If I move C, I can change its x-coordinate. If I move A, I can change both x and y, but in a specific ratio.So, starting from A=(0,0), B=(1,0), C=(0,1).If I move B: B can go to (1,0 + k). Let's choose k=1, so B moves to (1,1). Now, A=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(0,1).Now, if I move C: The translation vector for C is parallel to (A - B) = (0,0) - (1,1) = (-1,-1). So, C can be moved by any vector k*(-1,-1). C is at (0,1). So, moving along (-1,-1), C can go to (0 - k, 1 - k). Let's choose k=1, so C moves to (-1,0). But that's moving away from the target. Alternatively, k=0.5, so C moves to (-0.5, 0.5). Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe moving A. The translation vector for A is parallel to (B - C) = (1,1) - (0,1) = (1,0). So, A can be moved by any vector k*(1,0). So, A is at (0,0), so moving along x-axis. Let's move A to (1,0). But B is already at (1,1). So, maybe moving A to (2,0). But that's further away.Alternatively, moving B again. The translation vector for B is parallel to (A - C) = (0,0) - (0,1) = (0,-1). So, B can be moved by any vector k*(0,-1). B is at (1,1). So, moving down along y-axis. Let's move B to (1,0). But that's back to the original position. Not helpful.Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try moving C first.From the initial positions, moving C: translation vector is parallel to (A - B) = (-1,0). So, C can move along x-axis. C is at (0,1). Let's move C to (1,1). Now, positions are A=(0,0), B=(1,0), C=(1,1).Now, moving A: translation vector is parallel to (B - C) = (1,0) - (1,1) = (0,-1). So, A can be moved along y-axis. A is at (0,0). Let's move A to (0,1). But C is already at (1,1). So, maybe moving A to (0,2). Then, positions are A=(0,2), B=(1,0), C=(1,1).Now, moving B: translation vector is parallel to (A - C) = (0,2) - (1,1) = (-1,1). So, B can be moved by k*(-1,1). B is at (1,0). Let's choose k=1, so B moves to (0,1). Now, positions are A=(0,2), B=(0,1), C=(1,1).Now, moving C: translation vector is parallel to (A - B) = (0,2) - (0,1) = (0,1). So, C can be moved along y-axis. C is at (1,1). Let's move C to (1,2). Now, positions are A=(0,2), B=(0,1), C=(1,2).Now, moving A: translation vector is parallel to (B - C) = (0,1) - (1,2) = (-1,-1). So, A can be moved by k*(-1,-1). A is at (0,2). Let's choose k=2, so A moves to (-2,0). Not helpful. Alternatively, k=1, so A moves to (-1,1). Still not helpful.Alternatively, moving B: translation vector is parallel to (A - C) = (0,2) - (1,2) = (-1,0). So, B can be moved along x-axis. B is at (0,1). Let's move B to (1,1). Now, positions are A=(0,2), B=(1,1), C=(1,2).Now, moving C: translation vector is parallel to (A - B) = (0,2) - (1,1) = (-1,1). So, C can be moved by k*(-1,1). C is at (1,2). Let's choose k=1, so C moves to (0,3). Not helpful. Alternatively, k=0.5, so C moves to (0.5, 2.5). Not helpful.Hmm, this seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to try a different sequence of moves.Wait, let me think about the problem in terms of linear algebra. Each move is a translation by a vector that's a scalar multiple of the vector between the other two points. So, each move can be represented as adding a vector to one of the points, where the vector is a multiple of the difference between the other two points.So, the problem reduces to whether the target configuration can be reached by a series of such translations.Let me denote the points as vectors A, B, C. The target is A' = A, B' = (1,1), C' = (0,2).So, the difference between B' and B is (1,1) - (1,0) = (0,1). So, we need to increase B's y-coordinate by 1.Similarly, the difference between C' and C is (0,2) - (0,1) = (0,1). So, we need to increase C's y-coordinate by 1.So, both B and C need to increase their y-coordinates by 1. How can we achieve that?Well, moving B can change its y-coordinate, but only along certain directions. Similarly for C.Wait, when moving B, the translation vector is parallel to (A - C). Initially, (A - C) is (0,0) - (0,1) = (0,-1). So, moving B can only change its y-coordinate by multiples of -1. So, moving B up would require a negative multiple, which would actually decrease its y-coordinate. Wait, no, because the translation vector is k*(0,-1), so k can be negative. So, if k is negative, say k = -1, then the translation vector is (0,1), which would increase B's y-coordinate by 1. So, moving B from (1,0) to (1,1) is possible by choosing k = -1.Similarly, moving C, the translation vector is parallel to (A - B). Initially, (A - B) is (0,0) - (1,0) = (-1,0). So, moving C can change its x-coordinate by multiples of -1. So, moving C from (0,1) to (1,1) is possible by choosing k = -1.So, perhaps the strategy is to first move B up by 1 unit, then move C right by 1 unit, but wait, moving C right would take it to (1,1), but then we can't move it further up because the translation vector would change.Wait, let's try:1. Move B: translation vector k*(0,-1). Choose k = -1, so B moves from (1,0) to (1,1).2. Now, positions are A=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(0,1).3. Now, move C: translation vector is parallel to (A - B) = (0,0) - (1,1) = (-1,-1). So, translation vector is k*(-1,-1). C is at (0,1). Let's choose k = -1, so C moves to (1,2). Now, positions are A=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(1,2).4. Now, move B: translation vector is parallel to (A - C) = (0,0) - (1,2) = (-1,-2). So, translation vector is k*(-1,-2). B is at (1,1). Let's choose k = -1, so B moves to (2,3). Not helpful.Alternatively, moving A: translation vector is parallel to (B - C) = (1,1) - (1,2) = (0,-1). So, A can be moved along y-axis. A is at (0,0). Let's move A to (0,1). Now, positions are A=(0,1), B=(1,1), C=(1,2).5. Now, move C: translation vector is parallel to (A - B) = (0,1) - (1,1) = (-1,0). So, C can be moved along x-axis. C is at (1,2). Let's move C to (0,2). Now, positions are A=(0,1), B=(1,1), C=(0,2).6. Now, move A: translation vector is parallel to (B - C) = (1,1) - (0,2) = (1,-1). So, A can be moved by k*(1,-1). A is at (0,1). Let's choose k = 1, so A moves to (1,0). Now, positions are A=(1,0), B=(1,1), C=(0,2).7. Now, move B: translation vector is parallel to (A - C) = (1,0) - (0,2) = (1,-2). So, B can be moved by k*(1,-2). B is at (1,1). Let's choose k = 0, so no move. Alternatively, k = 1, so B moves to (2,-1). Not helpful.Alternatively, moving C: translation vector is parallel to (A - B) = (1,0) - (1,1) = (0,-1). So, C can be moved along y-axis. C is at (0,2). Let's move C to (0,1). But then we're back to an earlier position.Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe I need to try a different approach.Wait, let me think about the problem in terms of invariant properties. Maybe there's some invariant that prevents reaching the target configuration.For example, maybe the area of the triangle formed by the three points is an invariant modulo something.Initially, the area is 0.5, since it's a right-angled triangle with legs of length 1.The target configuration is also a right-angled triangle with legs 1 and 2, so area is 1.So, the area changes from 0.5 to 1. Is that possible?Wait, each move involves translating one point along a line parallel to the line through the other two. So, the area might change, but by how much?Let me calculate the area after each move.Starting area: 0.5.After moving B to (1,1), the new area is the area of triangle A=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(0,1). Using the formula for area: 0.5*| (x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B) ) |.Plugging in: 0.5*| 0*(1 - 1) + 1*(1 - 0) + 0*(0 - 1) | = 0.5*|0 + 1 + 0| = 0.5.So, area remains 0.5.Then, moving C to (1,2), the area becomes 0.5*|0*(1 - 2) + 1*(2 - 0) + 1*(0 - 1)| = 0.5*|0 + 2 -1| = 0.5*1 = 0.5.Still 0.5.Then, moving B to (2,3), area would be 0.5*|0*(3 - 2) + 2*(2 - 0) + 1*(0 - 3)| = 0.5*|0 + 4 -3| = 0.5*1 = 0.5.Hmm, so the area remains 0.5 throughout these moves. But the target configuration has area 1. So, that suggests that it's impossible to reach the target configuration because the area is an invariant modulo something.Wait, but the area can change if the translation vector is not parallel to the line through the other two points, but in this case, the translation vector is parallel, so the area might remain the same.Wait, let me think again. When you translate a point along a line parallel to the line through the other two, does the area of the triangle change?Let me consider two points fixed, say A and B, and moving C along a line parallel to AB. The area of the triangle ABC is 0.5*base*height. If I move C parallel to AB, the height remains the same because the distance from C to AB doesn't change. So, the area remains the same.Similarly, if I move A or B along a line parallel to the line through the other two, the area remains the same.Therefore, the area is an invariant. It cannot change through any number of moves.In the initial configuration, the area is 0.5. In the target configuration, the area is 1. Since 0.5 ≠ 1, it's impossible to reach the target configuration.Therefore, the answer is no, they cannot reach the coordinates (0,0), (1,1), (0,2)."},{"question":"Calculate the area of a parallelogram constructed on vectors (vec{a}) and (vec{b}), given the lengths of its diagonals, (cos (widehat{vec{a}, vec{b}})), and (| vec{a} times vec{b} |), where[vec{a} = 5 vec{p} + 2 vec{q}, quad vec{b} = vec{p} - 3 vec{q}, quad |vec{p}| = 4 sqrt{2}, quad |vec{q}| = 6, quad (widehat{vec{p}, vec{q}}) = frac{pi}{4}]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the area of a parallelogram constructed on vectors (vec{a}) and (vec{b}).

Hmm, wait, actually, looking back, the problem statement says it's given the lengths of its diagonals, (cos (widehat{vec{a}, vec{b}})), and (| vec{a} times vec{b} |). But hold on, the vectors (vec{a}) and (vec{b}) are given in terms of (vec{p}) and (vec{q}), with their magnitudes and the angle between them.

Hmm, let me think.Wait, perhaps the problem is to calculate the area using the given information, which includes the diagonals, the cosine of the angle between (vec{a}) and (vec{b}), and the cross product. But actually, if we have (| vec{a} times vec{b} |), that's the area, so maybe the rest is extra information? Or perhaps it's a trick question where I need to verify that the area is consistent with the given diagonals and angle?Alternatively, maybe the problem is to compute the area using the diagonals and the angle between the vectors, rather than directly computing the cross product. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.Wait, let me check the problem statement again:\\"Calculate the area of a parallelogram constructed on vectors (vec{a}) and (vec{b}), given the lengths of its diagonals, (cos (widehat{vec{a}, vec{b}})), and (| vec{a} times vec{b} |), where...\\"Wait, hold on, maybe it's a translation issue. The original problem might have been in another language, and the translation is a bit off. It says, \\"given the lengths of its diagonals, (cos (widehat{vec{a}, vec{b}})), and (| vec{a} times vec{b} |)\\". So, perhaps it's saying that the lengths of the diagonals are given, along with the cosine of the angle between (vec{a}) and (vec{b}), and the magnitude of the cross product. But in the problem statement, they don't actually give numerical values for the diagonals or the cosine; instead, they give expressions for (vec{a}) and (vec{b}) in terms of (vec{p}) and (vec{q}), along with their magnitudes and the angle between them.So perhaps the problem is to compute the area using the cross product, which is straightforward, but also to compute it using the diagonals and the angle, and confirm that both methods give the same result? Or maybe it's just to compute the cross product's magnitude.Given that, let's see. The area of the parallelogram is indeed (| vec{a} times vec{b} |). So, if we can compute that, we can find the area. Alternatively, if we can compute the lengths of the diagonals and the angle between the vectors, we can use another formula for the area.But let me see. The vectors (vec{a}) and (vec{b}) are given in terms of (vec{p}) and (vec{q}). So, perhaps the first step is to express (vec{a}) and (vec{b}) in terms of (vec{p}) and (vec{q}), compute their cross product, and then find its magnitude.Alternatively, since we know (vec{p}) and (vec{q}) have magnitudes (4sqrt{2}) and 6, respectively, and the angle between them is (pi/4), we can compute the cross product of (vec{a}) and (vec{b}) in terms of (vec{p}) and (vec{q}), then compute its magnitude.So, let's try that.First, let's write down (vec{a}) and (vec{b}):[vec{a} = 5 vec{p} + 2 vec{q}][vec{b} = vec{p} - 3 vec{q}]We need to compute (vec{a} times vec{b}). Let's do that.First, recall that the cross product is distributive over vector addition, so:[vec{a} times vec{b} = (5 vec{p} + 2 vec{q}) times (vec{p} - 3 vec{q})]Expanding this, we get:[5 vec{p} times vec{p} - 15 vec{p} times vec{q} + 2 vec{q} times vec{p} - 6 vec{q} times vec{q}]Now, recall that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so (vec{p} times vec{p} = 0) and (vec{q} times vec{q} = 0). So, those terms drop out.Also, remember that (vec{q} times vec{p} = - vec{p} times vec{q}). So, let's substitute that in:[5 cdot 0 - 15 vec{p} times vec{q} + 2 (- vec{p} times vec{q}) - 6 cdot 0][= -15 vec{p} times vec{q} - 2 vec{p} times vec{q}][= (-15 - 2) vec{p} times vec{q}][= -17 vec{p} times vec{q}]So, (vec{a} times vec{b} = -17 vec{p} times vec{q}). Therefore, the magnitude is:[| vec{a} times vec{b} | = 17 | vec{p} times vec{q} |]Now, we need to compute (| vec{p} times vec{q} |). The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors is given by:[| vec{p} times vec{q} | = | vec{p} | | vec{q} | sin theta]where (theta) is the angle between (vec{p}) and (vec{q}). We are given that (theta = frac{pi}{4}), so (sin theta = sin frac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}).We are also given that (| vec{p} | = 4 sqrt{2}) and (| vec{q} | = 6). Plugging these in:[| vec{p} times vec{q} | = (4 sqrt{2})(6) left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right )]Let's compute this step by step.First, multiply (4 sqrt{2}) and 6:[4 sqrt{2} times 6 = 24 sqrt{2}]Then, multiply that by (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}):[24 sqrt{2} times frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = 24 times frac{2}{2} = 24 times 1 = 24]So, (| vec{p} times vec{q} | = 24).Therefore, going back to (| vec{a} times vec{b} |):[| vec{a} times vec{b} | = 17 times 24 = 408]So, the area of the parallelogram is 408.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 17 times 24 is 408, which seems a bit large, but given the vectors, maybe it's correct.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the cross product expansion. Let me go back.We had:[vec{a} times vec{b} = (5 vec{p} + 2 vec{q}) times (vec{p} - 3 vec{q})][= 5 vec{p} times vec{p} - 15 vec{p} times vec{q} + 2 vec{q} times vec{p} - 6 vec{q} times vec{q}][= 0 - 15 vec{p} times vec{q} - 2 vec{p} times vec{q} + 0][= (-15 - 2) vec{p} times vec{q}][= -17 vec{p} times vec{q}]Yes, that seems correct. So, the cross product is -17 times (vec{p} times vec{q}), so the magnitude is 17 times the magnitude of (vec{p} times vec{q}), which we found to be 24, so 17*24=408.Alternatively, maybe I should compute the area using another method, like the formula involving the lengths of the diagonals and the angle between the vectors. Let's see.Wait, the formula for the area of a parallelogram in terms of the diagonals and the angle between them is a bit more complicated. I think it's:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2 sin phi]where (d_1) and (d_2) are the lengths of the diagonals, and (phi) is the angle between them. But wait, is that correct? Hmm, actually, I think that formula is for the area of a quadrilateral, but for a parallelogram, the area can be expressed in terms of the diagonals and the angle between them as:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2 sin theta]where (theta) is the angle between the diagonals. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the cross product method since it's straightforward.But just to confirm, let's compute the lengths of the diagonals and see if we can compute the area another way.In a parallelogram, the diagonals are (vec{a} + vec{b}) and (vec{a} - vec{b}). So, let's compute these vectors.First, compute (vec{a} + vec{b}):[vec{a} + vec{b} = (5 vec{p} + 2 vec{q}) + (vec{p} - 3 vec{q}) = 6 vec{p} - vec{q}]Similarly, compute (vec{a} - vec{b}):[vec{a} - vec{b} = (5 vec{p} + 2 vec{q}) - (vec{p} - 3 vec{q}) = 4 vec{p} + 5 vec{q}]Now, let's compute the lengths of these diagonals.First, compute (| vec{a} + vec{b} |):[| 6 vec{p} - vec{q} |]To compute this, we can use the formula:[| vec{u} + vec{v} |^2 = | vec{u} |^2 + | vec{v} |^2 + 2 vec{u} cdot vec{v}]But in this case, it's (6 vec{p} - vec{q}), so:[| 6 vec{p} - vec{q} |^2 = (6)^2 | vec{p} |^2 + (-1)^2 | vec{q} |^2 + 2 times 6 times (-1) vec{p} cdot vec{q}][= 36 | vec{p} |^2 + | vec{q} |^2 - 12 vec{p} cdot vec{q}]We know (| vec{p} | = 4 sqrt{2}), so (| vec{p} |^2 = (4 sqrt{2})^2 = 16 times 2 = 32).Similarly, (| vec{q} | = 6), so (| vec{q} |^2 = 36).The dot product (vec{p} cdot vec{q}) is:[vec{p} cdot vec{q} = | vec{p} | | vec{q} | cos theta = (4 sqrt{2})(6) cos frac{pi}{4}][= 24 sqrt{2} times frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = 24 times 1 = 24]So, plugging back into the expression:[| 6 vec{p} - vec{q} |^2 = 36 times 32 + 36 - 12 times 24]Wait, hold on, no:Wait, the expression is:[36 | vec{p} |^2 + | vec{q} |^2 - 12 vec{p} cdot vec{q}][= 36 times 32 + 36 - 12 times 24]Compute each term:36 * 32: Let's compute 36*30=1080, 36*2=72, so total 1080+72=1152.36 is just 36.12*24=288.So, putting it all together:1152 + 36 - 288 = (1152 + 36) - 288 = 1188 - 288 = 900.Therefore, (| 6 vec{p} - vec{q} |^2 = 900), so the length is (sqrt{900} = 30).So, the length of the first diagonal is 30.Now, compute the length of the second diagonal, which is (| 4 vec{p} + 5 vec{q} |):Again, using the formula:[| 4 vec{p} + 5 vec{q} |^2 = (4)^2 | vec{p} |^2 + (5)^2 | vec{q} |^2 + 2 times 4 times 5 vec{p} cdot vec{q}][= 16 times 32 + 25 times 36 + 40 times 24]Compute each term:16*32: 16*30=480, 16*2=32, total 480+32=512.25*36: 25*30=750, 25*6=150, total 750+150=900.40*24=960.So, adding them up:512 + 900 + 960 = (512 + 900) + 960 = 1412 + 960 = 2372.Wait, that can't be right because 512 + 900 is 1412, plus 960 is 2372. So, (| 4 vec{p} + 5 vec{q} |^2 = 2372), so the length is (sqrt{2372}).Wait, let me compute (sqrt{2372}). Let's see:2372 divided by 4 is 593, which is a prime number, I think. So, (sqrt{2372} = sqrt{4 times 593} = 2 sqrt{593}). Hmm, 593 is a prime, so we can't simplify further. So, the length of the second diagonal is (2 sqrt{593}).Wait, that seems complicated. Let me check my calculations again because 4^2 * 32 is 16*32=512, 5^2*36=25*36=900, and 2*4*5=40, times the dot product which is 24, so 40*24=960. So, 512 + 900 + 960 = 2372. Yes, that's correct.So, the lengths of the diagonals are 30 and (2 sqrt{593}).Now, if I wanted to compute the area using the diagonals and the angle between them, I would need the angle between the diagonals. But the problem statement mentions (cos (widehat{vec{a}, vec{b}})), which is the angle between (vec{a}) and (vec{b}), not the angle between the diagonals.So, perhaps I can compute the angle between the diagonals and then use the formula for the area?Alternatively, maybe the formula for the area in terms of the diagonals and the angle between the diagonals is:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2 sin theta]where (theta) is the angle between the diagonals. But I don't have (theta), so I might need to compute it.Alternatively, perhaps there's another formula involving the lengths of the diagonals and the angle between the sides, which is given as (cos (widehat{vec{a}, vec{b}})).Wait, let's recall that in a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to twice the sum of the squares of the sides:[d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2)]But I don't know if that helps directly with the area.Alternatively, the area can be expressed as:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2 sin phi]where (phi) is the angle between the diagonals. But since I don't know (phi), maybe I can relate it to the angle between the sides.Alternatively, maybe I can express the area in terms of the sides and the angle between them, which is given as (cos (widehat{vec{a}, vec{b}})). Since the area is also equal to (| vec{a} | | vec{b} | sin theta), where (theta) is the angle between (vec{a}) and (vec{b}). So, if I can compute (| vec{a} |), (| vec{b} |), and (sin theta), I can compute the area.Given that, let's compute (| vec{a} |) and (| vec{b} |).First, compute (| vec{a} |):[| vec{a} | = | 5 vec{p} + 2 vec{q} |]Using the formula:[| 5 vec{p} + 2 vec{q} |^2 = (5)^2 | vec{p} |^2 + (2)^2 | vec{q} |^2 + 2 times 5 times 2 vec{p} cdot vec{q}][= 25 times 32 + 4 times 36 + 20 times 24]Compute each term:25*32=8004*36=14420*24=480Adding them up:800 + 144 + 480 = (800 + 144) + 480 = 944 + 480 = 1424So, (| vec{a} |^2 = 1424), so (| vec{a} | = sqrt{1424}). Let's see if we can simplify that.1424 divided by 16 is 89, so (sqrt{1424} = sqrt{16 times 89} = 4 sqrt{89}). So, (| vec{a} | = 4 sqrt{89}).Similarly, compute (| vec{b} |):[| vec{b} | = | vec{p} - 3 vec{q} |]Using the formula:[| vec{p} - 3 vec{q} |^2 = (1)^2 | vec{p} |^2 + (-3)^2 | vec{q} |^2 + 2 times 1 times (-3) vec{p} cdot vec{q}][= 1 times 32 + 9 times 36 - 6 times 24]Compute each term:1*32=329*36=3246*24=144So, putting it together:32 + 324 - 144 = (32 + 324) - 144 = 356 - 144 = 212Therefore, (| vec{b} |^2 = 212), so (| vec{b} | = sqrt{212}). Simplify:212 divided by 4 is 53, so (sqrt{212} = sqrt{4 times 53} = 2 sqrt{53}).So, (| vec{b} | = 2 sqrt{53}).Now, we also know that (cos (widehat{vec{a}, vec{b}})) is given. Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says \\"given the lengths of its diagonals, (cos (widehat{vec{a}, vec{b}})), and (| vec{a} times vec{b} |)\\". But in the problem statement, they don't actually provide numerical values for the diagonals or the cosine; instead, they give expressions for (vec{a}) and (vec{b}) in terms of (vec{p}) and (vec{q}), along with their magnitudes and the angle between them.Wait, hold on, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.Wait, the problem says:\\"Calculate the area of a parallelogram constructed on vectors (vec{a}) and (vec{b}), given the lengths of its diagonals, (cos (widehat{vec{a}, vec{b}})), and (| vec{a} times vec{b} |), where[vec{a} = 5 vec{p} + 2 vec{q}, quad vec{b} = vec{p} - 3 vec{q}, quad |vec{p}| = 4 sqrt{2}, quad |vec{q}| = 6, quad (widehat{vec{p}, vec{q}}) = frac{pi}{4}]\\"So, actually, the problem is giving us (vec{a}) and (vec{b}) in terms of (vec{p}) and (vec{q}), along with the magnitudes of (vec{p}) and (vec{q}), and the angle between them. It says that the area is given by the lengths of the diagonals, the cosine of the angle between (vec{a}) and (vec{b}), and the magnitude of the cross product. But since we can compute the cross product directly, as we did earlier, perhaps the problem is just asking us to compute that.But given that, we already found that the area is 408. So, perhaps that's the answer.Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to compute the area using the diagonals and the angle between the sides, but since we have the cross product, it's straightforward.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to compute the area using the formula involving the diagonals and the angle between them, but since we don't have the angle between the diagonals, we need to compute it.Wait, let's see. If we have the lengths of the diagonals, which we found to be 30 and (2 sqrt{593}), and we can compute the angle between the diagonals, then we can use the formula:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2 sin phi]where (phi) is the angle between the diagonals.But how do we find (phi)?Alternatively, perhaps we can relate the angle between the sides to the angle between the diagonals.Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, and the angle between the diagonals can be related to the angles of the parallelogram.Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the angle between the diagonals using vector operations.Since the diagonals are (vec{a} + vec{b}) and (vec{a} - vec{b}), we can compute the angle between them using the dot product.So, let's compute the dot product of (vec{a} + vec{b}) and (vec{a} - vec{b}):[(vec{a} + vec{b}) cdot (vec{a} - vec{b}) = | vec{a} |^2 - | vec{b} |^2]Wait, that's a useful identity. So, the dot product is equal to (| vec{a} |^2 - | vec{b} |^2).We already computed (| vec{a} |^2 = 1424) and (| vec{b} |^2 = 212), so:[(vec{a} + vec{b}) cdot (vec{a} - vec{b}) = 1424 - 212 = 1212]Also, the dot product can be expressed as:[| vec{a} + vec{b} | | vec{a} - vec{b} | cos phi = 1212]We already computed (| vec{a} + vec{b} | = 30) and (| vec{a} - vec{b} | = 2 sqrt{593}). So:[30 times 2 sqrt{593} times cos phi = 1212][60 sqrt{593} cos phi = 1212][cos phi = frac{1212}{60 sqrt{593}} = frac{1212}{60 sqrt{593}} = frac{20.2}{sqrt{593}}]Wait, let me compute that.First, 1212 divided by 60 is 20.2. So,[cos phi = frac{20.2}{sqrt{593}}]But (sqrt{593}) is approximately sqrt(576)=24, sqrt(625)=25, so sqrt(593)≈24.35.So, 20.2 / 24.35 ≈ 0.83.So, (cos phi ≈ 0.83), so (phi ≈ arccos(0.83) ≈ 33.9 degrees).But this is approximate. However, we can compute it exactly.Wait, let's compute (sqrt{593}):593 is a prime number, so (sqrt{593}) is irrational. So, we can leave it as is.So, (cos phi = frac{20.2}{sqrt{593}}). But 20.2 is 101/5, so:[cos phi = frac{101}{5 sqrt{593}} = frac{101 sqrt{593}}{5 times 593} = frac{101 sqrt{593}}{2965}]But that's not particularly helpful.Alternatively, perhaps we can compute (sin phi) using the identity:[sin^2 phi + cos^2 phi = 1]So,[sin phi = sqrt{1 - cos^2 phi} = sqrt{1 - left( frac{1212}{60 sqrt{593}} right)^2 }]But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can compute (sin phi) using the cross product of the diagonals.Wait, the area of the parallelogram can also be expressed as:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} | (vec{a} + vec{b}) times (vec{a} - vec{b}) |]But wait, that's actually the area of the quadrilateral formed by the diagonals, but in a parallelogram, the area is actually twice the area of the triangle formed by the diagonals. Hmm, maybe not.Wait, actually, in a parallelogram, the area can be expressed as:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} | (vec{a} + vec{b}) times (vec{a} - vec{b}) |]But let's compute that.Compute ((vec{a} + vec{b}) times (vec{a} - vec{b})):[(6 vec{p} - vec{q}) times (4 vec{p} + 5 vec{q})]Expanding this:[6 vec{p} times 4 vec{p} + 6 vec{p} times 5 vec{q} - vec{q} times 4 vec{p} - vec{q} times 5 vec{q}]Simplify term by term:- (6 vec{p} times 4 vec{p} = 24 (vec{p} times vec{p}) = 0)- (6 vec{p} times 5 vec{q} = 30 (vec{p} times vec{q}))- (- vec{q} times 4 vec{p} = -4 (vec{q} times vec{p}) = 4 (vec{p} times vec{q})) (since (vec{q} times vec{p} = - vec{p} times vec{q}))- (- vec{q} times 5 vec{q} = -5 (vec{q} times vec{q}) = 0)So, combining the terms:[0 + 30 (vec{p} times vec{q}) + 4 (vec{p} times vec{q}) + 0 = 34 (vec{p} times vec{q})]Therefore,[(vec{a} + vec{b}) times (vec{a} - vec{b}) = 34 (vec{p} times vec{q})]So, the magnitude is:[| (vec{a} + vec{b}) times (vec{a} - vec{b}) | = 34 | vec{p} times vec{q} | = 34 times 24 = 816]Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is:[frac{1}{2} times 816 = 408]Which matches our earlier result.So, regardless of the method, we get the area as 408.Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is 408.**Final Answer**The area of the parallelogram is boxed{408}."},{"question":"For a natural number ( N ), if at least six of the nine natural numbers from 1 to 9 are factors of ( N ), then ( N ) is called a “six-match number.” Find the smallest \\"six-match number\\" greater than 2000.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest \\"six-match number\\" greater than 2000. A six-match number is defined as a natural number ( N ) such that at least six of the nine natural numbers from 1 to 9 are factors of ( N ). That means ( N ) should be divisible by six or more numbers in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. First, I should understand what this means. If ( N ) is a six-match number, then it must be divisible by six different numbers from 1 through 9. Since 1 is a factor of every number, that's automatically included. So, effectively, ( N ) needs to be divisible by five more numbers from 2 to 9. My goal is to find the smallest such ( N ) that is greater than 2000. So, I need to look for numbers just above 2000 and check if they meet the six-match criteria.Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of certain numbers. If I can find an LCM that includes as many numbers from 2 to 9 as possible, then that LCM will be a candidate. However, since I need the smallest such number above 2000, I might have to look for multiples of this LCM that are just above 2000.But before jumping into that, let me consider the numbers from 2 to 9 and see which combinations would give me the most factors. The numbers 2 through 9 are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.I know that some of these numbers are multiples of others. For example, 4 is 2 squared, 6 is 2 times 3, 8 is 2 cubed, and 9 is 3 squared. So, if I include 4, 6, 8, or 9, I might automatically include their factors as well. Therefore, to maximize the number of factors, it's better to include numbers that have higher exponents or are primes. For example, including 8 (which is 2^3) will cover the factors 2 and 4 as well, since 8 is divisible by both. Similarly, including 9 (which is 3^2) will cover 3 as a factor.So, if I take the LCM of 8 and 9, which are 2^3 and 3^2, that would be 72. But 72 is much smaller than 2000, so I need a multiple of 72 that is just above 2000. Let me calculate that.2000 divided by 72 is approximately 27.777. So, the next integer is 28. Therefore, 72 multiplied by 28 is 2016. So, 2016 is a multiple of 72, which is the LCM of 8 and 9. Let me check if 2016 is a six-match number.First, let's list the factors of 2016 from 1 to 9.1: Yes, always a factor.2: 2016 is even, so yes.3: Sum of digits is 2+0+1+6=9, which is divisible by 3, so yes.4: The last two digits, 16, are divisible by 4, so yes.5: The last digit is 6, not 0 or 5, so no.6: Since it's divisible by both 2 and 3, yes.7: Let's check. 2016 divided by 7 is 288, so yes, 7 is a factor.8: The last three digits, 016, are 16, which is divisible by 8, so yes.9: Sum of digits is 9, which is divisible by 9, so yes.So, let's count how many factors from 1 to 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. That's eight factors. So, 2016 is actually an eight-match number, which is more than the required six. But wait, the problem asks for the smallest six-match number greater than 2000. So, 2016 is a candidate. But is there a smaller number between 2000 and 2016 that is a six-match number?Let me check numbers between 2000 and 2016.Starting from 2001:2001: Let's see its factors from 1-9.1: Yes.2: 2001 is odd, so no.3: Sum of digits is 2+0+0+1=3, so yes.4: Last two digits 01, which is 1, not divisible by 4, so no.5: Ends with 1, so no.6: Needs to be divisible by 2 and 3. Since it's not divisible by 2, no.7: Let's check 2001 ÷ 7. 7*285=1995, 2001-1995=6, so remainder 6. Not divisible.8: Last three digits 001, which is 1, not divisible by 8.9: Sum of digits is 3, not divisible by 9.So, factors are 1, 3. Only two factors.

Only two. Not enough.2016:As I checked earlier, 2016 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. That's eight factors. So, it's definitely a six-match number.But wait, before I conclude that 2016 is the answer, I should check if there's a number between 2000 and 2016 that is a six-match number. From the above checks, numbers 2000 to 2015 don't have enough factors. So, 2016 is the next candidate.But just to be thorough, let me check 2016 again.2016 ÷ 1 = 2016, yes.2016 ÷ 2 = 1008, yes.2016 ÷ 3 = 672, yes.2016 ÷ 4 = 504, yes.2016 ÷ 5 = 403.2, no.2016 ÷ 6 = 336, yes.2016 ÷ 7 = 288, yes.2016 ÷ 8 = 252, yes.2016 ÷ 9 = 224, yes.So, it's missing only 5. So, factors are 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. Eight factors. So, it's an eight-match number.But is 2016 the smallest six-match number above 2000? It seems so because all numbers between 2000 and 2016 have fewer than six factors from 1 to 9.But just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Maybe instead of checking each number, I can find numbers that are multiples of several numbers from 2 to 9.For example, if I can find a number that is a multiple of 8 and 9, which is 72, as I did earlier, then 72*28=2016. So, 2016 is the first multiple of 72 above 2000.But perhaps there's a smaller multiple of another set of numbers that gives a six-match number.Wait, another thought: if I can find a number that is a multiple of 6, 7, and 8, that would cover more factors. Let me see.The LCM of 6, 7, 8 is LCM(6,7,8). Let's compute that.First, factor each:6 = 2*37 = 78 = 2^3So, LCM is 2^3 * 3 * 7 = 8*3*7=168.So, multiples of 168 above 2000.2000 ÷ 168 ≈ 11.904. So, next integer is 12. 168*12=2016. So, again, 2016.So, 2016 is the next multiple of 168 after 2000.Alternatively, if I take LCM of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, that would be a larger number, but perhaps it's smaller than 2016? Let me check.Wait, LCM of 5,6,7,8,9.Factor each:5=56=2*37=78=2^39=3^2So, LCM is 2^3 * 3^2 *5 *7=8*9*5*7=2520.2520 is larger than 2016, so 2016 is smaller.So, 2016 is the LCM of 6,7,8, which is 168, and 168*12=2016.Alternatively, if I take LCM of 8 and 9, which is 72, and 72*28=2016.So, both approaches lead to 2016.But let me think if there is a number less than 2016, greater than 2000, which is a multiple of at least five numbers from 2 to 9 (since 1 is automatic). So, maybe a number that is a multiple of 5,6,7,8, but not necessarily all.Wait, let me think about the number 2010.Earlier, I saw that 2010 is divisible by 1,2,3,5,6. That's five factors. If it were divisible by one more, say 4 or 7 or 9, it would be a six-match number.But 2010 is not divisible by 4 (since 10 is not divisible by 4), not divisible by 7 (2010 ÷7≈287.14), and not divisible by 9 (sum is 3). So, only five factors.Similarly, 2016 is the next multiple of 72, which is 8*9, so it's divisible by 8 and 9, which brings in more factors.Alternatively, let me think about the number 2020.Wait, 2020 is beyond 2016, so 2016 is still smaller.Alternatively, maybe 2016 is indeed the smallest.But just to make sure, let me think about another angle.What if I consider numbers that are multiples of 5, since 5 is a prime and not covered by other numbers. So, if a number is a multiple of 5, it can cover that factor.But 2016 is not a multiple of 5, so it's missing 5. But it has eight other factors, so it's still a six-match number.But perhaps, if I can find a number that is a multiple of 5 and also several others, maybe I can get a six-match number.For example, let's consider 2020. 2020 is a multiple of 5, 2, 4, 10, but 10 is beyond 9. Let me check factors from 1-9.2020:1: Yes.2: Even, yes.3: Sum is 2+0+2+0=4, not divisible by 3.4: Last two digits 20, which is divisible by 4, yes.5: Ends with 0, yes.6: Needs 2 and 3, not 3, so no.7: 2020 ÷7≈288.571, no.8: Last three digits 020, which is 20, not divisible by 8.9: Sum is 4, not divisible by 9.So, factors: 1,2,4,5. Only four. Not enough.Alternatively, 2025.Wait, 2025 is 45 squared, which is 9*225, but that's beyond 2016.Wait, 2025 is 45^2, which is 2025. Let me check its factors.2025:1: Yes.2: Odd, no.3: Sum is 2+0+2+5=9, divisible by 3, yes.4: Last two digits 25, which is 25, not divisible by 4.5: Ends with 5, yes.6: Needs 2 and 3, not 2, so no.7: 2025 ÷7≈289.285..., no.8: Last three digits 025, which is 25, not divisible by 8.9: Sum is 9, divisible by 9, yes.So, factors: 1,3,5,9. Only four. Not enough.Alternatively, 2016 is still better.Wait, another idea: maybe numbers that are multiples of 7 and 8, but not necessarily 9.But 2016 is a multiple of both 7 and 8, as we saw.Alternatively, let me think about the number 2016. It's 2^5 * 3^2 *7. So, it's divisible by 2,3,4,6,7,8,9. So, that's seven factors. So, it's a seven-match number, which is more than six.So, perhaps, 2016 is indeed the smallest such number.But let me think if there is a number between 2000 and 2016 that is a multiple of, say, 6,7,8, but not necessarily 9.Wait, 2016 is the first multiple of 168 (which is LCM of 6,7,8) above 2000. So, 168*12=2016.But 168*11=1848, which is below 2000.So, 2016 is the next one.Alternatively, if I can find a number that is a multiple of 5,6,7,8, but not necessarily 9, but that would require the LCM of 5,6,7,8, which is 840. 840*3=2520, which is higher than 2016.So, 2016 is still smaller.Alternatively, let me think about numbers that are multiples of 7 and 8, but not necessarily 6 or 9.But 2016 is the first multiple of 56 (which is LCM of 7 and 8) above 2000.Wait, 56*35=1960, 56*36=2016.So, 2016 is the next multiple of 56 after 1960.But 2016 is also a multiple of 6 and 9, so it's better.Alternatively, if I take LCM of 7 and 9, which is 63. 63*32=2016.So, 2016 is a multiple of 63 as well.So, in any case, 2016 seems to be the number that is a multiple of several of these numbers, giving it multiple factors.But let me think if there's a number less than 2016, greater than 2000, that is a multiple of, say, 5,6,7, but not necessarily 8 or 9.Let me try 2010, which is 5*402, but as we saw earlier, it's only divisible by 1,2,3,5,6. So, five factors.Similarly, 2016 is the next multiple of 6 after 2010, but it's also a multiple of 7 and 8, giving it more factors.Alternatively, let me think about 2020, but that's beyond 2016.Wait, 2016 is the next multiple of 7 after 2009 (which is 7*287). 2009+7=2016.So, 2016 is the next multiple of 7 after 2009.Similarly, it's the next multiple of 8 after 2008 (2008+8=2016).And it's the next multiple of 9 after 2007 (2007+9=2016).So, 2016 is the next multiple of 7,8,9 after 2000.Therefore, it's the first number after 2000 that is a multiple of 7,8,9, which gives it multiple factors.So, in conclusion, after checking all numbers from 2001 to 2015, none of them have six or more factors from 1 to 9. The next number, 2016, is a multiple of 7,8,9, and hence has eight factors from 1 to 9, making it a six-match number.Therefore, the smallest six-match number greater than 2000 is 2016.**Final Answer**The smallest \\"six-match number\\" greater than 2000 is boxed{2016}."},{"question":"An e-commerce retailer is transitioning to eco-friendly shipping materials to help reduce their carbon footprint. They have determined that using these new materials will decrease their environmental impact by a certain percentage. The retailer currently ships 500 packages per month using traditional materials, which contributes to 1000 units of carbon emissions.1. If the use of eco-friendly materials reduces carbon emissions by (x%) per package, express the total carbon emissions (E(x)) as a polynomial function of (x).2. The retailer has set a goal to reduce their total carbon emissions to 700 units per month. Solve the inequality (E(x) leq 700) to find the minimum percentage reduction (x) needed to achieve this goal.","answer":"First, I need to understand the current situation. The retailer ships 500 packages per month, and each package contributes to 2 units of carbon emissions, totaling 1000 units.Next, I'll express the total carbon emissions after using eco-friendly materials. If the eco-friendly materials reduce emissions by (x%), then the new emissions per package would be (2 times (1 - frac{x}{100})). Multiplying this by the number of packages gives the total emissions function (E(x)).So, the total carbon emissions function is:[E(x) = 500 times 2 times left(1 - frac{x}{100}right) = 1000 - 10x]Now, to find the minimum percentage reduction needed to achieve a total of 700 units of carbon emissions, I'll set up the inequality:[1000 - 10x leq 700]Solving for (x), I subtract 1000 from both sides:[-10x leq -300]Then, divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number:[x geq 30]Therefore, the retailer needs to achieve a minimum reduction of 30% in carbon emissions per package to meet their goal."},{"question":"For the infinite sequence of numbers ( x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, ldots ), the relationship ( x_{n} = x_{n-1} cdot x_{n-3} ) holds for all natural numbers ( n geq 4 ).

The sequence starts with x₁ = 1, x₂ = 1, and x₃ = -1. I need to find x₂₀₂₂. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, let me write down the given information:- x₁ = 1- x₂ = 1- x₃ = -1- For n ≥ 4, xₙ = xₙ₋₁ × xₙ₋₃So, starting from the fourth term, each term is the product of the term immediately before it and the term three places before it.

Let's see. From x₁ to x₆: 1,1,-1,-1,-1,1Then x₇ to x₁₂: -1,1,1,-1,-1,-1x₁₃ to x₁₈:1,-1,1,1,-1,-1x₁₉ to x₂₄: -1,1,-1,1,1,-1Wait, maybe I'm not seeing it correctly. Let me group them in 6 terms each:Group 1: x₁ to x₆: 1,1,-1,-1,-1,1Group 2: x₇ to x₁₂: -1,1,1,-1,-1,-1Group 3: x₁₃ to x₁₈:1,-1,1,1,-1,-1Group 4: x₁₉ to x₂₄: -1,1,-1,1,1,-1Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, let's list the terms with their indices:1:12:13:-14:-15:-16:17:-18:19:110:-111:-112:-113:114:-115:116:117:-118:-119:-120:1So, looking at this, I can see that every 6 terms, the pattern repeats? Let's check:From x₁ to x₆: 1,1,-1,-1,-1,1From x₇ to x₁₂: -1,1,1,-1,-1,-1From x₁₃ to x₁₈:1,-1,1,1,-1,-1From x₁₉ to x₂₄: -1,1,-1,1,1,-1Wait, that doesn't seem to be a repetition of the same 6-term block. Maybe the cycle is longer.Alternatively, maybe the cycle is 12 terms? Let's see:Looking at x₁ to x₁₂: 1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1x₁₃ to x₂₄:1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1Wait, no, that doesn't seem to repeat either. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the cycle is 8 terms? Let me check:x₁ to x₈:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1x₉ to x₁₆:1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1x₁₇ to x₂₄:-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1Hmm, not really. Maybe 10 terms? Let's see:x₁ to x₁₀:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1x₁₁ to x₂₀:-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1Not the same. Hmm.Wait, maybe I should look for a cycle in the exponents or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is periodic with a certain period.Let me see the terms again:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,...So, starting from x₁, every 6 terms, the pattern is 1,1,-1,-1,-1,1, then again -1,1,1,-1,-1,-1, then 1,-1,1,1,-1,-1, then -1,1,-1,1,1,-1, etc.Wait, maybe the cycle is 12 terms? Let me check:From x₁ to x₁₂:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1From x₁₃ to x₂₄:1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1Hmm, not the same. Wait, x₁₃ is 1, which is same as x₁, but x₁₄ is -1, which is same as x₂, but x₁₅ is 1, which is same as x₃? Wait, no, x₃ is -1. Hmm, not matching.Wait, maybe the cycle is 24 terms? That seems too long. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is periodic with period 6, but shifted. Let me check:Looking at x₁ to x₆:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1x₇ to x₁₂:-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1x₁₃ to x₁₈:1,-1,1,1,-1,-1x₁₉ to x₂₄:-1,1,-1,1,1,-1Hmm, each block of 6 terms seems to be a shifted version of the previous one. Maybe the cycle is 6 terms, but each time shifted by one? Not sure.Alternatively, maybe the cycle is 12 terms. Let me check if x₁ equals x₁₃, x₂ equals x₁₄, etc.x₁ = 1, x₁₃ =1: samex₂=1, x₁₄=-1: differentSo, no, not a 12-term cycle.Wait, maybe the cycle is 8 terms?

That seems too long.Wait, maybe I should think about the recurrence relation.Given that xₙ = xₙ₋₁ × xₙ₋₃.This is a linear recurrence relation, but multiplicative rather than additive. Hmm, multiplicative recurrences can sometimes be tricky, but maybe taking logarithms could help? However, since the terms can be negative, taking logarithms might not be straightforward because log of negative numbers isn't real. So, maybe that's not the way.Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the terms as exponents in some modulus. Since the terms are either 1 or -1, maybe we can model this as a sequence in the multiplicative group {1, -1} under multiplication modulo something.Wait, in the multiplicative group {1, -1}, the operation is multiplication, and the elements have order 2 because (-1)^2 = 1. So, maybe the exponents can be considered modulo 2.But how does that help with the recurrence?Alternatively, maybe we can model the exponents as a linear recurrence over GF(2). Let me think.If I let yₙ = (xₙ + 1)/2, which maps 1 to 1 and -1 to 0. Then, the recurrence becomes:xₙ = xₙ₋₁ × xₙ₋₃So, in terms of yₙ:If xₙ = 1, then yₙ = 1If xₙ = -1, then yₙ = 0So, the recurrence is:xₙ = xₙ₋₁ × xₙ₋₃Which can be written as:yₙ = (xₙ + 1)/2 = (xₙ₋₁ × xₙ₋₃ + 1)/2But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express the recurrence in terms of yₙ.Wait, since xₙ = xₙ₋₁ × xₙ₋₃, and xₙ is either 1 or -1, then yₙ = (xₙ + 1)/2 is 1 if xₙ = 1, else 0.So, xₙ = 2yₙ - 1.Substituting into the recurrence:2yₙ - 1 = (2yₙ₋₁ - 1)(2yₙ₋₃ - 1)Expanding the right-hand side:(2yₙ₋₁ - 1)(2yₙ₋₃ - 1) = 4yₙ₋₁ yₙ₋₃ - 2yₙ₋₁ - 2yₙ₋₃ + 1So, 2yₙ - 1 = 4yₙ₋₁ yₙ₋₃ - 2yₙ₋₁ - 2yₙ₋₃ + 1Bringing all terms to one side:2yₙ - 1 - 4yₙ₋₁ yₙ₋₃ + 2yₙ₋₁ + 2yₙ₋₃ - 1 = 0Simplify:2yₙ - 4yₙ₋₁ yₙ₋₃ + 2yₙ₋₁ + 2yₙ₋₃ - 2 = 0Divide both sides by 2:yₙ - 2yₙ₋₁ yₙ₋₃ + yₙ₋₁ + yₙ₋₃ - 1 = 0Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe this approach isn't helpful.Alternatively, perhaps I can model the exponents modulo 2. Since xₙ is either 1 or -1, which are multiplicative inverses of themselves. So, maybe the exponents can be considered modulo 2.Wait, let's think about the exponents in terms of powers of -1. Since xₙ is either 1 or -1, we can write xₙ = (-1)^{aₙ}, where aₙ is an integer. Then, the recurrence becomes:xₙ = xₙ₋₁ × xₙ₋₃ ⇒ (-1)^{aₙ} = (-1)^{aₙ₋₁} × (-1)^{aₙ₋₃} = (-1)^{aₙ₋₁ + aₙ₋₃}Therefore, aₙ ≡ aₙ₋₁ + aₙ₋₃ mod 2.So, now we have a linear recurrence relation modulo 2:aₙ ≡ aₙ₋₁ + aₙ₋₃ mod 2With initial conditions:x₁ = 1 ⇒ a₁ = 0x₂ = 1 ⇒ a₂ = 0x₃ = -1 ⇒ a₃ = 1So, now we can model the sequence aₙ as a linear recurrence modulo 2, which might be easier to analyze.Let me write down the initial terms of aₙ:a₁ = 0a₂ = 0a₃ = 1Now, compute a₄:a₄ ≡ a₃ + a₁ ≡ 1 + 0 ≡ 1 mod 2a₅ ≡ a₄ + a₂ ≡ 1 + 0 ≡ 1 mod 2a₆ ≡ a₅ + a₃ ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2a₇ ≡ a₆ + a₄ ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 2a₈ ≡ a₇ + a₅ ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2a₉ ≡ a₈ + a₆ ≡ 0 + 0 ≡ 0 mod 2a₁₀ ≡ a₉ + a₇ ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 2a₁₁ ≡ a₁₀ + a₈ ≡ 1 + 0 ≡ 1 mod 2a₁₂ ≡ a₁₁ + a₉ ≡ 1 + 0 ≡ 1 mod 2a₁₃ ≡ a₁₂ + a₁₀ ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2a₁₄ ≡ a₁₃ + a₁₁ ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 2a₁₅ ≡ a₁₄ + a₁₂ ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2a₁₆ ≡ a₁₅ + a₁₃ ≡ 0 + 0 ≡ 0 mod 2a₁₇ ≡ a₁₆ + a₁₄ ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 2a₁₈ ≡ a₁₇ + a₁₅ ≡ 1 + 0 ≡ 1 mod 2a₁₉ ≡ a₁₈ + a₁₆ ≡ 1 + 0 ≡ 1 mod 2a₂₀ ≡ a₁₉ + a₁₇ ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2a₂₁ ≡ a₂₀ + a₁₈ ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 2a₂₂ ≡ a₂₁ + a₁₉ ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2a₂₃ ≡ a₂₂ + a₂₀ ≡ 0 + 0 ≡ 0 mod 2a₂₄ ≡ a₂₃ + a₂₁ ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 2a₂₅ ≡ a₂₄ + a₂₂ ≡ 1 + 0 ≡ 1 mod 2a₂₆ ≡ a₂₅ + a₂₃ ≡ 1 + 0 ≡ 1 mod 2a₂₇ ≡ a₂₆ + a₂₄ ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2a₂₈ ≡ a₂₇ + a₂₅ ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 2a₂₉ ≡ a₂₈ + a₂₆ ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2a₃₀ ≡ a₂₉ + a₂₇ ≡ 0 + 0 ≡ 0 mod 2Hmm, okay, let's list these aₙ:n: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30aₙ:0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0Looking at this, I notice a repeating pattern every 6 terms: 0,0,1,1,1,0From n=1 to n=6: 0,0,1,1,1,0n=7 to n=12:1,0,0,1,1,1Wait, that's not the same as the first 6. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.Wait, let's see:From n=1: 0,0,1,1,1,0n=7:1,0,0,1,1,1n=13:0,1,0,0,1,1n=19:1,1,0,1,0,0n=25:1,1,1,0,1,0n=31:0,1,1,1,0,1Hmm, it seems like the pattern shifts each time. Maybe the cycle is longer.Alternatively, perhaps the period is 12 terms? Let's check:Looking at a₁ to a₁₂:0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1a₁₃ to a₂₄:0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1a₂₅ to a₃₆:1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1Hmm, not the same as the first 12. So, maybe the period is longer.Alternatively, maybe the period is 24 terms? Let me check:a₁ to a₂₄:0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1a₂₅ to a₄₈:1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1Hmm, not the same. Maybe the period is 36? That seems too long.Wait, maybe instead of looking at aₙ, I can look at the original xₙ sequence again.Looking back at xₙ:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,...I notice that every 6 terms, the pattern is 1,1,-1,-1,-1,1, then -1,1,1,-1,-1,-1, then 1,-1,1,1,-1,-1, then -1,1,-1,1,1,-1, etc.Wait, maybe the cycle is 12 terms, but with a shift each time. Alternatively, perhaps the cycle is 18 terms.Wait, let me try to see if xₙ repeats every 12 terms.x₁ to x₁₂:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1x₁₃ to x₂₄:1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1x₂₅ to x₃₆:1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1Wait, x₁₃ to x₂₄ is similar to x₁ to x₁₂ but shifted. Hmm, not exactly the same.Wait, x₁₃ is 1, which is same as x₁, x₁₄ is -1, same as x₂, x₁₅ is 1, same as x₃, but x₃ is -1. So, not the same.Wait, maybe the cycle is 18 terms. Let me check:x₁ to x₁₈:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1x₁₉ to x₃₆:-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1Hmm, not the same.Alternatively, maybe the cycle is 6 terms, but with a different starting point each time.Wait, looking back, the original xₙ sequence seems to have a repeating pattern of 6 terms, but each time shifted by one.From x₁:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1From x₇:-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1From x₁₃:1,-1,1,1,-1,-1From x₁₉:-1,1,-1,1,1,-1From x₂₅:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1Wait, x₂₅ is 1, same as x₁. So, maybe after 24 terms, the pattern repeats? Let's check:x₁ to x₂₄:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1x₂₅ to x₄₈:1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1Yes! It seems that starting from x₂₅, the sequence repeats the original x₁ to x₂₄. So, the period is 24 terms.Therefore, the sequence is periodic with period 24.So, if the period is 24, then xₙ = xₙ₊₂₄ for all n.Therefore, to find x₂₀₂₂, we can compute 2022 modulo 24.Let me compute 2022 divided by 24:24 × 84 = 20162022 - 2016 = 6So, 2022 ≡ 6 mod 24.Therefore, x₂₀₂₂ = x₆.Looking back at the sequence, x₆ = 1.Wait, let me confirm:x₁ =1, x₂=1, x₃=-1, x₄=-1, x₅=-1, x₆=1.Yes, x₆ is 1.Therefore, x₂₀₂₂ = 1.Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning about the period being 24. Earlier, I noticed that x₂₅ to x₄₈ is the same as x₁ to x₂₄, so the period is indeed 24.Therefore, the answer should be 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"For which natural numbers ( n ), the number ( 3^{2n+1} - 2^{2n+1} - 6^n ) is composite?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: For which natural numbers ( n ), the number ( 3^{2n+1} - 2^{2n+1} - 6^n ) is composite? Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First off, natural numbers are positive integers, so ( n = 1, 2, 3, ) and so on. I need to find for which of these ( n ) the expression ( 3^{2n+1} - 2^{2n+1} - 6^n ) results in a composite number. Remember, composite numbers are positive integers that have at least one positive divisor other than one and themselves. So, essentially, I need to check when this expression isn't prime.Let me start by plugging in some small values of ( n ) to see what happens. Maybe I can spot a pattern or figure out a general formula.Starting with ( n = 1 ):( 3^{2*1+1} - 2^{2*1+1} - 6^1 = 3^3 - 2^3 - 6 = 27 - 8 - 6 = 13 ). Hmm, 13 is a prime number. So, for ( n = 1 ), the result is prime, which means it's not composite. So, ( n = 1 ) is out.Next, ( n = 2 ):( 3^{2*2+1} - 2^{2*2+1} - 6^2 = 3^5 - 2^5 - 36 = 243 - 32 - 36 = 175 ). Let's see, 175. Is that composite? Yes, because 175 divided by 5 is 35, so it's 5*35, which is 5*5*7. So, definitely composite. So, ( n = 2 ) works.Moving on to ( n = 3 ):( 3^{2*3+1} - 2^{2*3+1} - 6^3 = 3^7 - 2^7 - 216 = 2187 - 128 - 216 = 2187 - 344 = 1843 ). Hmm, is 1843 composite? Let me check. Divided by 13: 13*141 is 1833, so 1843 - 1833 is 10, so no. Divided by 7: 7*263 is 1841, so 1843 - 1841 is 2, so no. Maybe 11: 11*167 is 1837, 1843 - 1837 is 6, so no. 17: 17*108 is 1836, 1843 - 1836 is 7, so no. 19: 19*97 is 1843? Let me check: 19*90 is 1710, 19*7 is 133, so 1710 + 133 is 1843. Yes! So, 19*97 is 1843. So, 1843 is composite. So, ( n = 3 ) is good.Now, ( n = 4 ):( 3^{2*4+1} - 2^{2*4+1} - 6^4 = 3^9 - 2^9 - 1296 = 19683 - 512 - 1296 = 19683 - 1808 = 17875 ). Is 17875 composite? Well, it ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5. 17875 divided by 5 is 3575, which is still divisible by 5, so yes, definitely composite. So, ( n = 4 ) is good.( n = 5 ):( 3^{11} - 2^{11} - 6^5 = 177147 - 2048 - 7776 = 177147 - 2048 is 175,099; 175,099 - 7776 is 167,323. Is 167,323 composite? Let me test some small primes. Divided by 7: 7*23,903 is 167,321, so 167,323 - 167,321 is 2, so no. Divided by 11: 11*15,211 is 167,321, same as above. 13: 13*12,871 is 167,323? Let me check: 13*12,000 is 156,000; 13*871 is 11,323; so 156,000 + 11,323 is 167,323. Yes! So, 13*12,871 is 167,323, so it's composite. So, ( n = 5 ) is good.Hmm, so far, for ( n = 2, 3, 4, 5 ), the expression is composite. Only ( n = 1 ) gives a prime. Maybe ( n = 6 ) as well?Let's try ( n = 6 ):( 3^{13} - 2^{13} - 6^6 = 1594323 - 8192 - 46656 = 1594323 - 8192 is 1586131; 1586131 - 46656 is 1539475. Is 1,539,475 composite? It ends with a 5, so yes, divisible by 5. So, definitely composite. So, ( n = 6 ) is good.Wait, maybe I should try ( n = 0 ) just in case, but natural numbers usually start at 1, so maybe not. But just for fun, ( n = 0 ):( 3^{1} - 2^{1} - 6^0 = 3 - 2 - 1 = 0 ). 0 is neither prime nor composite, so it doesn't count.So, so far, all ( n geq 2 ) give composite numbers, while ( n = 1 ) gives a prime. Is this always the case? Let me see if I can find a general pattern or formula.Looking at the expression: ( 3^{2n+1} - 2^{2n+1} - 6^n ). Let me try to factor this expression or find some common terms.First, note that ( 3^{2n+1} = 3 cdot 9^n ) and ( 2^{2n+1} = 2 cdot 4^n ). So, substituting these in, the expression becomes:( 3 cdot 9^n - 2 cdot 4^n - 6^n ).Hmm, maybe I can factor this somehow. Let's see. Let me write all terms with base 3 and 2:( 3 cdot (3^2)^n - 2 cdot (2^2)^n - (2 cdot 3)^n )Which simplifies to:( 3^{2n+1} - 2^{2n+1} - 6^n ).Not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor out something common. Let me see:Looking at ( 3^{2n+1} - 2^{2n+1} ), that's similar to ( a^{k+1} - b^{k+1} ), which can be factored as ( (a - b)(a^k + a^{k-1}b + dots + b^k) ). So, maybe I can factor ( 3^{2n+1} - 2^{2n+1} ) as ( (3 - 2)(3^{2n} + 3^{2n -1} cdot 2 + dots + 2^{2n}) ). Which simplifies to ( 1 times ) that sum, so just the sum.So, ( 3^{2n+1} - 2^{2n+1} = 3^{2n} + 3^{2n -1} cdot 2 + dots + 2^{2n} ). Hmm, but then we subtract ( 6^n ) from that. Not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as:( 3 cdot 9^n - 2 cdot 4^n - 6^n ).Is there a way to factor this? Maybe factor out a common term. Let's see:Looking at ( 3 cdot 9^n ) and ( 6^n ), which is ( (3 cdot 2)^n = 3^n cdot 2^n ). So, maybe factor out ( 3^n ) from the first and third terms:( 3^n (3 cdot 3^n - 2^n) - 2 cdot 4^n ).Wait, let me see:( 3 cdot 9^n = 3 cdot (3^2)^n = 3^{2n + 1} ).( 6^n = (3 cdot 2)^n = 3^n cdot 2^n ).So, maybe:( 3^{2n + 1} - 6^n = 3 cdot 9^n - 3^n cdot 2^n ).Factor out ( 3^n ):( 3^n (3 cdot 3^n - 2^n) ).So, the entire expression is ( 3^n (3 cdot 3^n - 2^n) - 2^{2n + 1} ).Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of 6^n. Let me see:( 3^{2n + 1} = 3 cdot 9^n = 3 cdot (3^2)^n = 3 cdot (3^n)^2 ).Similarly, ( 2^{2n + 1} = 2 cdot 4^n = 2 cdot (2^2)^n = 2 cdot (2^n)^2 ).So, the expression becomes:( 3 cdot (3^n)^2 - 2 cdot (2^n)^2 - 6^n ).Let me denote ( a = 3^n ) and ( b = 2^n ). Then the expression becomes:( 3a^2 - 2b^2 - ab ).Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of a and b. Maybe I can factor this quadratic.Looking at ( 3a^2 - ab - 2b^2 ). Let me try to factor this:Looking for factors of the form (ma + nb)(pa + qb). Let's see:Multiply out: (ma + nb)(pa + qb) = mpa^2 + (mq + np)ab + nqb^2.We need this to equal 3a^2 - ab - 2b^2.So, set up equations:1. ( mp = 3 )2. ( mq + np = -1 )3. ( nq = -2 )Looking for integer solutions.From equation 1: possible m and p are (3,1) or (1,3). Let's try m=3, p=1.From equation 3: nq = -2. Possible pairs: (n,q) = (2,-1), (-2,1), (1,-2), (-1,2).Let's try n=2, q=-1:Then equation 2: mq + np = 3*(-1) + 2*1 = -3 + 2 = -1. Perfect, that's equation 2.So, the factors are (3a + 2b)(a - b).Let me check:(3a + 2b)(a - b) = 3a^2 - 3ab + 2ab - 2b^2 = 3a^2 - ab - 2b^2. Yes, that works.So, the expression factors as ( (3a + 2b)(a - b) ), where ( a = 3^n ) and ( b = 2^n ). So, substituting back:( (3 cdot 3^n + 2 cdot 2^n)(3^n - 2^n) ).Simplify:( (3^{n+1} + 2^{n+1})(3^n - 2^n) ).So, the original expression ( 3^{2n+1} - 2^{2n+1} - 6^n ) factors into ( (3^{n+1} + 2^{n+1})(3^n - 2^n) ).Wow, that's a useful factorization. So, now, the expression is the product of two terms: ( 3^{n+1} + 2^{n+1} ) and ( 3^n - 2^n ). So, for the entire expression to be composite, at least one of these factors must be greater than 1, and both factors must be integers greater than 1, right?Wait, but let's check for ( n = 1 ):( 3^{2} + 2^{2} = 9 + 4 = 13 ), and ( 3^1 - 2^1 = 3 - 2 = 1 ). So, 13 * 1 = 13, which is prime, as we saw earlier.For ( n = 2 ):( 3^3 + 2^3 = 27 + 8 = 35 ), and ( 3^2 - 2^2 = 9 - 4 = 5 ). So, 35 * 5 = 175, which is composite.Similarly, for ( n = 3 ):( 3^4 + 2^4 = 81 + 16 = 97 ), and ( 3^3 - 2^3 = 27 - 8 = 19 ). So, 97 * 19 = 1843, which is composite.So, in general, for ( n geq 2 ), both ( 3^{n+1} + 2^{n+1} ) and ( 3^n - 2^n ) are greater than 1, so their product is composite. For ( n = 1 ), one of the factors is 1, so the product is prime.Therefore, the expression is composite for all natural numbers ( n geq 2 ).Wait, let me just verify for ( n = 1 ) again. The expression is 13, which is prime, so indeed, only ( n = 1 ) gives a prime, and all ( n geq 2 ) give composite numbers.So, the answer should be all natural numbers ( n ) except ( n = 1 ). So, for ( n geq 2 ), the expression is composite.But let me just check ( n = 6 ) again with the factorization to make sure:( 3^{7} + 2^{7} = 2187 + 128 = 2315 ), and ( 3^6 - 2^6 = 729 - 64 = 665 ). So, 2315 * 665. Wait, but earlier, when I calculated ( n = 6 ), I got 1,539,475. Let me check 2315 * 665:2315 * 600 = 1,389,0002315 * 65 = let's compute 2315*60=138,900 and 2315*5=11,575. So, 138,900 + 11,575 = 150,475Total: 1,389,000 + 150,475 = 1,539,475. Yes, that's correct. So, the factorization works.Therefore, the conclusion is that for all natural numbers ( n geq 2 ), the expression ( 3^{2n+1} - 2^{2n+1} - 6^n ) is composite, and for ( n = 1 ), it's prime.So, the answer is all natural numbers ( n ) except ( n = 1 ). In other words, for all ( n geq 2 ), the number is composite.**Final Answer**The number is composite for all natural numbers ( n ) except ( n = 1 ). Thus, the solution is boxed{n geq 2}.Wait, hold on, the question asks \\"For which natural numbers ( n ), the number... is composite?\\" So, it's asking for the set of ( n ) where the number is composite. Since ( n = 1 ) gives a prime, and all ( n geq 2 ) give composite numbers, the answer is all natural numbers ( n ) with ( n geq 2 ). So, in boxed form, I should write ( n geq 2 ). But sometimes, in math problems, they expect the answer in terms of ( n ) being greater than or equal to 2, or all natural numbers except 1.But the problem says \\"for which natural numbers ( n )\\", so the answer is all natural numbers ( n ) except ( n = 1 ). So, in LaTeX, I can write it as ( n geq 2 ), but maybe the problem expects the answer in a different form.Alternatively, since ( n ) is a natural number, starting at 1, the answer is all natural numbers ( n ) where ( n ) is greater than or equal to 2. So, I think writing ( n geq 2 ) is appropriate.**Final Answer**The number is composite for all natural numbers ( n ) with ( n geq 2 ). Thus, the solution is boxed{n geq 2}.Wait, but in the initial problem statement, it's asking \\"For which natural numbers ( n )\\", so maybe it's better to specify the set as ( n in mathbb{N} setminus {1} ), but in the answer, they usually prefer a specific form. Since the user instruction says to put the final answer within boxed{}, and in the examples, they use n geq something, so I think boxed{n geq 2} is fine.Alternatively, if they prefer listing the values, but since it's an infinite set, it's better to describe it with an inequality.Yes, I think boxed{n geq 2} is the appropriate way to present the answer.**Final Answer**boxed{n geq 2}"},{"question":"As a junior high school student fascinated by entomology, you have decided to conduct a study on the growth of a particular ant colony in your backyard. You observe that the number of ants in the colony triples every month. 1. If the initial number of ants in the colony is represented by ( a_0 = 50 ), express the number of ants ( a_n ) after ( n ) months as a function of ( n ).2. After how many months will the number of ants first exceed 2000?","answer":"To determine the number of ants after ( n ) months, I start with the initial population of 50 ants. Since the colony triples every month, the population follows an exponential growth pattern. The formula for exponential growth is ( a_n = a_0 times r^n ), where ( a_0 ) is the initial amount, ( r ) is the growth rate, and ( n ) is the number of periods. In this case, ( r = 3 ) because the population triples each month. Therefore, the number of ants after ( n ) months is ( a_n = 50 times 3^n ).Next, to find out after how many months the ant population will exceed 2000, I set up the inequality ( 50 times 3^n > 2000 ). Dividing both sides by 50 gives ( 3^n > 40 ). To solve for ( n ), I take the natural logarithm of both sides: ( ln(3^n) > ln(40) ). Using the logarithm power rule, this simplifies to ( n times ln(3) > ln(40) ). Solving for ( n ) yields ( n > frac{ln(40)}{ln(3)} ). Calculating this gives approximately ( n > 3.38 ). Since the number of months must be a whole number, I round up to the next whole number, which is 4 months."},{"question":"If a and b are two distinct roots of the function f(x)=x^{2}-px+q (p > 0, q > 0), and the three numbers a, b, -2 can be properly arranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and can also be properly arranged to form a geometric sequence, then the value of p+q is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of ( p + q ) given some conditions about the roots of a quadratic function. Let me try to parse this step by step.First, the function is ( f(x) = x^2 - p x + q ), and it's given that ( p > 0 ) and ( q > 0 ). The roots of this function are ( a ) and ( b ), which are distinct. So, from Vieta's formulas, I know that:1. The sum of the roots ( a + b = p ).2. The product of the roots ( a cdot b = q ).So, ( p = a + b ) and ( q = a b ). Therefore, ( p + q = a + b + a b ). So, if I can find the values of ( a ) and ( b ), I can compute ( p + q ).Now, the problem states that the three numbers ( a ), ( b ), and ( -2 ) can be properly arranged to form an arithmetic sequence and also can be properly arranged to form a geometric sequence. Hmm, that's interesting. So, depending on the arrangement, these three numbers can form both an arithmetic and a geometric sequence.Let me break this down. First, let's consider the arithmetic sequence. An arithmetic sequence has a common difference between consecutive terms. So, if I arrange ( a ), ( b ), and ( -2 ) in some order, the difference between the first and second term should be equal to the difference between the second and third term.Similarly, for a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms should be constant. So, arranging ( a ), ( b ), and ( -2 ) in some order, the ratio of the second term to the first term should equal the ratio of the third term to the second term.Since the numbers can be arranged in different orders for each sequence, I need to consider all possible permutations for both arithmetic and geometric sequences.But before diving into all permutations, maybe I can find some relationships between ( a ) and ( b ) that must hold because of these conditions.Let me first think about the arithmetic sequence. Let me denote the three terms as ( x ), ( y ), ( z ) such that ( y - x = z - y ), which simplifies to ( 2y = x + z ). So, the middle term is the average of the other two.Similarly, for the geometric sequence, if the terms are ( x ), ( y ), ( z ), then ( y / x = z / y ), which implies ( y^2 = x z ).So, for both sequences, I can set up equations based on these properties.But since the same three numbers can form both sequences, just arranged differently, I need to find an arrangement for the arithmetic sequence and another arrangement for the geometric sequence.Given that ( a ), ( b ), and ( -2 ) are the numbers, let me list all possible permutations for the arithmetic sequence and the geometric sequence.But that might be too time-consuming. Maybe I can find some constraints.First, let's note that in a geometric sequence, all terms must be non-zero because you can't have zero in a geometric sequence (as division by zero is undefined). So, ( a ), ( b ), and ( -2 ) must all be non-zero. Since ( q = a b > 0 ), both ( a ) and ( b ) must be either both positive or both negative. But since ( p = a + b > 0 ), if both ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, their sum is positive. If both are negative, their sum would be negative, which contradicts ( p > 0 ). So, ( a ) and ( b ) must both be positive.Therefore, ( a > 0 ), ( b > 0 ), and ( -2 ) is negative. So, in the geometric sequence, since all terms must be non-zero, but ( -2 ) is negative, and ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, the geometric sequence must have terms with alternating signs if ( -2 ) is included. But wait, in a geometric sequence, if the common ratio is negative, the terms alternate in sign. However, since ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, and ( -2 ) is negative, perhaps ( -2 ) is the middle term or the first term.Wait, let's think about it. If the geometric sequence has three terms, one of them is negative (( -2 )) and the other two are positive (( a ) and ( b )). So, if the common ratio is negative, the sequence can alternate signs. But since we have only one negative term, maybe the negative term is either the first or the last term.Wait, no. If the common ratio is negative, then starting from a positive term, the next term is negative, and the third term is positive again. So, in that case, the sequence would have two positive terms and one negative term, which matches our case.Alternatively, if the common ratio is positive, all terms would have the same sign, but since we have a negative term, the common ratio must be negative.So, let's consider that the geometric sequence has a negative common ratio.So, let me denote the geometric sequence as ( x ), ( x r ), ( x r^2 ), where ( r ) is the common ratio, which must be negative because we have a negative term.Given that, let's suppose that ( -2 ) is one of the terms. So, either:1. ( x = -2 ), so the sequence is ( -2 ), ( -2 r ), ( -2 r^2 ).2. ( x r = -2 ), so the sequence is ( x ), ( -2 ), ( -2 r ).3. ( x r^2 = -2 ), so the sequence is ( x ), ( x r ), ( -2 ).Similarly, for the arithmetic sequence, the three terms ( a ), ( b ), ( -2 ) can be arranged in some order such that the middle term is the average of the other two.Given that ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, and ( -2 ) is negative, let's consider where ( -2 ) can be in the arithmetic sequence.Case 1: ( -2 ) is the first term. Then, the sequence would be ( -2 ), ( y ), ( z ), with ( y - (-2) = z - y ), so ( y + 2 = z - y ), which gives ( z = 2 y + 2 ).Case 2: ( -2 ) is the middle term. Then, the sequence would be ( x ), ( -2 ), ( z ), with ( -2 - x = z - (-2) ), so ( -2 - x = z + 2 ), which gives ( z = -x - 4 ).Case 3: ( -2 ) is the last term. Then, the sequence would be ( x ), ( y ), ( -2 ), with ( y - x = -2 - y ), so ( y - x = -2 - y ), which gives ( 2 y = x - 2 ).So, these are the three cases for the arithmetic sequence.Similarly, for the geometric sequence, as I considered earlier, we have three possibilities depending on where ( -2 ) is placed.This seems a bit complex, but maybe I can combine the information from both sequences.Since both sequences are formed by the same three numbers ( a ), ( b ), and ( -2 ), just arranged differently, perhaps I can find some relationships between them.Let me denote the arithmetic sequence as ( t_1 ), ( t_2 ), ( t_3 ) and the geometric sequence as ( s_1 ), ( s_2 ), ( s_3 ). Since both sequences consist of the same three numbers, just in different orders, the sets ( { t_1, t_2, t_3 } ) and ( { s_1, s_2, s_3 } ) are equal to ( { a, b, -2 } ).Given that, perhaps I can find expressions for ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of each other.Alternatively, maybe I can set up equations based on the arithmetic and geometric mean.Wait, another thought: since ( a ), ( b ), and ( -2 ) can form both an arithmetic and a geometric sequence, perhaps one of them is the arithmetic mean and another is the geometric mean of the other two? Hmm, not sure.Wait, let me think differently. Let me suppose that in the arithmetic sequence, ( -2 ) is the middle term. Then, as per the arithmetic sequence condition, the average of the other two terms is ( -2 ). So, ( (a + b)/2 = -2 ). But ( a + b = p > 0 ), so ( (a + b)/2 ) is positive, which can't be equal to ( -2 ). Therefore, ( -2 ) cannot be the middle term in the arithmetic sequence.Similarly, if ( -2 ) is the first term in the arithmetic sequence, then the next term is ( y ), and the third term is ( z ), with ( y - (-2) = z - y ). So, ( y + 2 = z - y ), which gives ( z = 2 y + 2 ). Since ( z ) must be one of ( a ) or ( b ), which are positive, ( y ) must be positive as well because ( y = a ) or ( y = b ). So, ( z = 2 y + 2 ) is positive.Alternatively, if ( -2 ) is the last term in the arithmetic sequence, then ( 2 y = x - 2 ). So, ( y = (x - 2)/2 ). Since ( y ) must be positive, ( x ) must be greater than 2.So, in the arithmetic sequence, ( -2 ) can be either the first term or the last term, but not the middle term.Similarly, for the geometric sequence, since ( -2 ) is negative and ( a ), ( b ) are positive, the geometric sequence must have a negative common ratio. So, the terms alternate in sign.Therefore, in the geometric sequence, the negative term must be either the first term, the second term, or the third term.But since we have only one negative term, which is ( -2 ), the geometric sequence must have ( -2 ) in one of the positions, and the other two terms positive.So, let's consider the three cases for the geometric sequence:1. ( -2 ) is the first term: So, the sequence is ( -2 ), ( -2 r ), ( -2 r^2 ). But since ( r ) is negative, ( -2 r ) is positive, and ( -2 r^2 ) is negative. But we only have one negative term, which is ( -2 ). So, this case would result in two negative terms, which is not possible because we have only ( -2 ) as the negative term. Therefore, this case is invalid.2. ( -2 ) is the second term: So, the sequence is ( x ), ( -2 ), ( -2 r ). Since ( x ) is positive, ( -2 ) is negative, and ( -2 r ) must be positive because ( r ) is negative. So, this is possible. So, in this case, ( x ), ( -2 ), ( -2 r ) are the three terms. Therefore, ( x ) and ( -2 r ) are positive, and ( -2 ) is negative.3. ( -2 ) is the third term: So, the sequence is ( x ), ( x r ), ( -2 ). Here, ( x ) is positive, ( x r ) is negative (since ( r ) is negative), and ( -2 ) is negative. But this would result in two negative terms (( x r ) and ( -2 )), which is not allowed because we have only one negative term. Therefore, this case is invalid.Therefore, the only valid case for the geometric sequence is when ( -2 ) is the second term, so the sequence is ( x ), ( -2 ), ( -2 r ), where ( x ) and ( -2 r ) are positive.So, from this, we can write the relationships:1. The common ratio ( r = (-2)/x ).2. The next term after ( -2 ) is ( -2 r ), which must be equal to one of ( a ) or ( b ).Wait, but in the geometric sequence, the terms are ( x ), ( -2 ), ( -2 r ). So, ( x ) is one of ( a ) or ( b ), ( -2 ) is the middle term, and ( -2 r ) is the other one of ( a ) or ( b ).So, let's denote:- ( x = a ) or ( x = b )- ( -2 r = b ) or ( -2 r = a )So, suppose ( x = a ), then ( -2 r = b ). Since ( r = (-2)/a ), substituting into ( -2 r = b ), we get:( -2 times (-2)/a = b ) => ( 4/a = b ).Alternatively, if ( x = b ), then ( -2 r = a ). Similarly, ( r = (-2)/b ), so ( -2 times (-2)/b = a ) => ( 4/b = a ).So, in either case, we have ( a times b = 4 ). Because if ( x = a ), then ( b = 4/a ), so ( a b = 4 ). Similarly, if ( x = b ), then ( a = 4/b ), so ( a b = 4 ).Therefore, from the geometric sequence condition, we have ( a b = 4 ). But wait, from Vieta's formula, ( a b = q ). So, ( q = 4 ).That's a useful piece of information.Now, moving on to the arithmetic sequence. As we saw earlier, ( -2 ) cannot be the middle term because that would require the average of ( a ) and ( b ) to be ( -2 ), which contradicts ( a + b = p > 0 ). So, ( -2 ) must be either the first or the last term in the arithmetic sequence.Let me consider both cases.Case 1: ( -2 ) is the first term in the arithmetic sequence.So, the sequence is ( -2 ), ( y ), ( z ), where ( y ) and ( z ) are ( a ) and ( b ) in some order.Since it's an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, ( y - (-2) = z - y ), which simplifies to:( y + 2 = z - y )So, ( 2 y = z - 2 )But ( z ) is either ( a ) or ( b ). Let's suppose ( y = a ) and ( z = b ). Then, the equation becomes:( 2 a = b - 2 )So, ( b = 2 a + 2 )Alternatively, if ( y = b ) and ( z = a ), then:( 2 b = a - 2 )So, ( a = 2 b + 2 )So, depending on the order, we have either ( b = 2 a + 2 ) or ( a = 2 b + 2 ).But we also know from Vieta's formula that ( a + b = p ) and ( a b = 4 ).So, let's consider both subcases.Subcase 1a: ( b = 2 a + 2 )Then, substituting into ( a + b = p ):( a + (2 a + 2) = p )( 3 a + 2 = p )And from ( a b = 4 ):( a (2 a + 2) = 4 )( 2 a^2 + 2 a - 4 = 0 )Divide both sides by 2:( a^2 + a - 2 = 0 )Solving this quadratic equation:( a = [-1 pm sqrt{1 + 8}]/2 = [-1 pm 3]/2 )So, ( a = (-1 + 3)/2 = 1 ) or ( a = (-1 - 3)/2 = -2 )But ( a ) must be positive because ( a ) and ( b ) are both positive (since ( p > 0 ) and ( q > 0 )). So, ( a = 1 ).Then, ( b = 2 a + 2 = 2(1) + 2 = 4 ).So, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 4 ), ( p = a + b = 5 ), ( q = a b = 4 ). Therefore, ( p + q = 5 + 4 = 9 ).Subcase 1b: ( a = 2 b + 2 )Then, substituting into ( a + b = p ):( (2 b + 2) + b = p )( 3 b + 2 = p )And from ( a b = 4 ):( (2 b + 2) b = 4 )( 2 b^2 + 2 b - 4 = 0 )Divide both sides by 2:( b^2 + b - 2 = 0 )Solving this quadratic equation:( b = [-1 pm sqrt{1 + 8}]/2 = [-1 pm 3]/2 )So, ( b = (-1 + 3)/2 = 1 ) or ( b = (-1 - 3)/2 = -2 )Again, ( b ) must be positive, so ( b = 1 ).Then, ( a = 2 b + 2 = 2(1) + 2 = 4 ).So, ( a = 4 ), ( b = 1 ), ( p = a + b = 5 ), ( q = a b = 4 ). Therefore, ( p + q = 5 + 4 = 9 ).So, in both subcases, we get ( p + q = 9 ).Now, let's check the other case where ( -2 ) is the last term in the arithmetic sequence.Case 2: ( -2 ) is the last term in the arithmetic sequence.So, the sequence is ( x ), ( y ), ( -2 ), where ( x ) and ( y ) are ( a ) and ( b ) in some order.Since it's an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, ( y - x = -2 - y ), which simplifies to:( y - x = -2 - y )So, ( 2 y = x - 2 )Again, ( x ) and ( y ) are ( a ) and ( b ). Let's consider both possibilities.Subcase 2a: ( x = a ), ( y = b )Then, ( 2 b = a - 2 )So, ( a = 2 b + 2 )Substituting into ( a + b = p ):( (2 b + 2) + b = p )( 3 b + 2 = p )And from ( a b = 4 ):( (2 b + 2) b = 4 )( 2 b^2 + 2 b - 4 = 0 )Divide by 2:( b^2 + b - 2 = 0 )Solving:( b = [-1 pm sqrt{1 + 8}]/2 = [-1 pm 3]/2 )So, ( b = 1 ) or ( b = -2 ). Since ( b > 0 ), ( b = 1 ).Then, ( a = 2 b + 2 = 4 ). So, same as before, ( a = 4 ), ( b = 1 ), ( p = 5 ), ( q = 4 ), ( p + q = 9 ).Subcase 2b: ( x = b ), ( y = a )Then, ( 2 a = b - 2 )So, ( b = 2 a + 2 )Substituting into ( a + b = p ):( a + (2 a + 2) = p )( 3 a + 2 = p )And from ( a b = 4 ):( a (2 a + 2) = 4 )( 2 a^2 + 2 a - 4 = 0 )Divide by 2:( a^2 + a - 2 = 0 )Solving:( a = [-1 pm sqrt{1 + 8}]/2 = [-1 pm 3]/2 )So, ( a = 1 ) or ( a = -2 ). Since ( a > 0 ), ( a = 1 ).Then, ( b = 2 a + 2 = 4 ). So, same as before, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 4 ), ( p = 5 ), ( q = 4 ), ( p + q = 9 ).So, regardless of whether ( -2 ) is the first or last term in the arithmetic sequence, we end up with the same values for ( a ) and ( b ), which are 1 and 4, leading to ( p = 5 ) and ( q = 4 ), so ( p + q = 9 ).But wait, let me verify if these values satisfy both the arithmetic and geometric sequence conditions.First, for the arithmetic sequence:If ( a = 1 ), ( b = 4 ), and ( -2 ), then arranging them as ( -2 ), ( 1 ), ( 4 ). Is this an arithmetic sequence?Compute the differences:( 1 - (-2) = 3 )( 4 - 1 = 3 )Yes, the common difference is 3, so it is an arithmetic sequence.Alternatively, arranging them as ( 1 ), ( 4 ), ( -2 ). Wait, that wouldn't be an arithmetic sequence because the differences would be ( 3 ) and ( -6 ), which are not equal. So, the correct arrangement is ( -2 ), ( 1 ), ( 4 ).For the geometric sequence:We have ( a = 1 ), ( b = 4 ), and ( -2 ). We need to arrange them in a geometric sequence.Earlier, we found that the geometric sequence must have ( -2 ) as the middle term, with the first term ( x ) and the third term ( -2 r ).So, let's see:If ( x = 1 ), then ( r = (-2)/1 = -2 ). Then, the third term is ( -2 r = -2(-2) = 4 ). So, the geometric sequence is ( 1 ), ( -2 ), ( 4 ).Check the ratios:( (-2)/1 = -2 )( 4/(-2) = -2 )Yes, the common ratio is ( -2 ), so it is a geometric sequence.Alternatively, if ( x = 4 ), then ( r = (-2)/4 = -0.5 ). Then, the third term is ( -2 r = -2(-0.5) = 1 ). So, the geometric sequence is ( 4 ), ( -2 ), ( 1 ).Check the ratios:( (-2)/4 = -0.5 )( 1/(-2) = -0.5 )Yes, the common ratio is ( -0.5 ), so it's also a geometric sequence.Therefore, both arrangements are valid, which confirms that our solution is correct.Hence, the value of ( p + q ) is ( 9 ).**Final Answer**boxed{9}"},{"question":"Let's call a number \\"remarkable\\" if it has exactly 4 different natural divisors, among which there are two such that neither is a multiple of the other. How many \\"remarkable\\" two-digit numbers exist?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many two-digit numbers are \\"remarkable.\\" A remarkable number is defined as having exactly 4 different natural divisors, and among these divisors, there are two such that neither is a multiple of the other. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, let's recall that the number of divisors a number has is related to its prime factorization. If a number N can be expressed as ( N = p_1^{a_1} times p_2^{a_2} times ldots times p_n^{a_n} ), then the total number of divisors is ( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)ldots(a_n + 1) ). Since we're looking for numbers with exactly 4 divisors, let's think about what the exponents in their prime factorization must be. The number 4 can be factored as 4 = 4 × 1 or 2 × 2. So, the possible forms of N are:1. ( p^3 ), where p is a prime number. This is because the number of divisors would be ( 3 + 1 = 4 ).2. ( p times q ), where p and q are distinct prime numbers. Here, the number of divisors is ( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 ).So, remarkable numbers must be either the cube of a prime or the product of two distinct primes.But wait, the problem also specifies that among the four divisors, there are two such that neither is a multiple of the other. Let's analyze both cases.**Case 1: N = p^3**The divisors of N in this case are 1, p, ( p^2 ), and ( p^3 ). Let's list them:1. 12. p3. ( p^2 )4. ( p^3 )Now, let's check if there are two divisors where neither is a multiple of the other. Looking at the list:- 1 is a divisor of every number, so any other divisor is a multiple of 1.- p divides ( p^2 ) and ( p^3 ), so p is a multiple of 1, but ( p^2 ) is a multiple of p, and ( p^3 ) is a multiple of ( p^2 ).So, in this case, every pair of divisors (other than 1 and p) has one that is a multiple of the other. Therefore, in the case of ( N = p^3 ), there are no two divisors where neither is a multiple of the other. Thus, numbers of the form ( p^3 ) do not satisfy the remarkable condition.**Case 2: N = p × q**Here, p and q are distinct primes. The divisors of N are 1, p, q, and pq. Let's list them:1. 12. p3. q4. pqNow, let's check the condition. We need two divisors where neither is a multiple of the other. Let's consider the divisors p and q. Since p and q are distinct primes, neither divides the other. So, p and q satisfy the condition. Therefore, numbers of the form ( p times q ) do satisfy the remarkable condition.So, remarkable numbers must be the product of two distinct primes. Now, we need to count how many two-digit numbers are products of two distinct primes.First, let's list all two-digit numbers that are the product of two distinct primes. These are called semi-primes or bi-primes.To find them, I can consider all primes less than 100 and check their products. However, since we're dealing with two-digit numbers, the primes involved must be such that their product is between 10 and 99.Let me list the primes less than 100:2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.But since we're multiplying two primes to get a two-digit number, the primes can't be too large. For example, the smallest prime is 2, so the other prime can be up to 49 (since 2 × 49 = 98). But 49 isn't prime, so actually, the primes can be up to, say, 47 because 2 × 47 = 94, which is still two-digit.But perhaps a better approach is to iterate through each prime p, and for each p, find all primes q > p such that p × q is a two-digit number.This way, we can avoid duplicates and ensure that we count each semi-prime only once.Let me start with p = 2:- q must be a prime such that 2 × q is between 10 and 99.- So, q must be between 5 (since 2 × 5 = 10) and 49 (since 2 × 49 = 98). But q must be prime.Primes q for p=2:5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.Let me calculate 2 × each:2×5=10, 2×7=14, 2×11=22, 2×13=26, 2×17=34, 2×19=38, 2×23=46, 2×29=58, 2×31=62, 2×37=74, 2×41=82, 2×43=86, 2×47=94.So, that's 13 numbers.Next, p=3:q must be primes greater than 3, such that 3×q is between 10 and 99.So, q must be between 4 (but since q must be prime, starting from 5) and 33 (since 3×33=99). But q must be prime.Primes q for p=3:5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31.Calculating 3× each:3×5=15, 3×7=21, 3×11=33, 3×13=39, 3×17=51, 3×19=57, 3×23=69, 3×29=87, 3×31=93.That's 9 numbers.Next, p=5:q must be primes greater than 5, such that 5×q is between 10 and 99.So, q must be between 3 (but q >5, so starting from 7) and 19 (since 5×19=95).Primes q for p=5:7,11,13,17,19.Calculating 5× each:5×7=35, 5×11=55, 5×13=65, 5×17=85, 5×19=95.That's 5 numbers.Next, p=7:q must be primes greater than 7, such that 7×q is between 10 and 99.So, q must be between 2 (but q >7, so starting from 11) and 14 (since 7×14=98, but 14 isn't prime). So, q must be primes up to 13, since 7×13=91.Primes q for p=7:11,13.Calculating 7× each:7×11=77, 7×13=91.That's 2 numbers.Next, p=11:q must be primes greater than 11, such that 11×q is between 10 and 99.So, q must be between 1 (but q >11, so starting from 13) and 9 (since 11×9=99, but 9 isn't prime). So, q can be 13,17,19,23,29,31,37, etc., but 11×q must be less than 100.Let's compute:11×13=143, which is three-digit, so too big.Wait, actually, 11×13=143, which is over 100, so actually, q must be such that 11×q < 100.So, q < 100/11 ≈9.09. But q must be a prime greater than 11, which is impossible because the next prime after 11 is 13, which is greater than 9.09. So, there are no such q for p=11. So, no numbers here.Similarly, for p=13:q must be primes greater than 13, such that 13×q is between 10 and 99.13×q <100 => q < 100/13 ≈7.69, but q must be greater than 13, which is impossible. So, no numbers here.Same logic applies for primes p=17 and above: 17×q would be at least 17×19=323, which is way beyond two digits. So, no numbers here.So, compiling all the numbers we have:From p=2: 10,14,22,26,34,38,46,58,62,74,82,86,94 (13 numbers)From p=3:15,21,33,39,51,57,69,87,93 (9 numbers)From p=5:35,55,65,85,95 (5 numbers)From p=7:77,91 (2 numbers)Total numbers: 13 + 9 + 5 + 2 = 29.Wait, but hold on.

Four.Okay, all these are fine.From p=3:15:1,3,5,15. Four.21:1,3,7,21. Four.33:1,3,11,33. Four.39:1,3,13,39. Four.51:1,3,17,51. Four.57:1,3,19,57. Four.69:1,3,23,69. Four.87:1,3,29,87.

Four.Yes, both have four divisors.So, all 29 numbers are indeed semi-primes with exactly four divisors. Now, we need to ensure that among these four divisors, there are two such that neither is a multiple of the other.Wait, but earlier, we concluded that in the case of N = p × q, the divisors are 1, p, q, pq. So, p and q are primes, so neither divides the other. Therefore, in all these cases, the condition is satisfied because p and q are such that neither is a multiple of the other.Therefore, all 29 numbers are remarkable.But hold on, let me think again. Is there any case where even though N is a product of two distinct primes, the condition isn't satisfied? For example, if p=2 and q=2, but they have to be distinct, so that's not possible. Since p and q are distinct primes, neither divides the other, so in all cases, p and q satisfy the condition.Therefore, all semi-primes with two distinct prime factors are remarkable.So, the total number of two-digit remarkable numbers is 29.Wait, but hold on. Let me recount the numbers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.From p=2: 13 numbers.From p=3:9 numbers.From p=5:5 numbers.From p=7:2 numbers.Total:13+9=22, 22+5=27, 27+2=29.Yes, 29 numbers.But wait, let me cross-verify with another approach.Another way is to list all two-digit semi-primes.Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the number of two-digit semi-primes is 29, but I want to make sure.Alternatively, let me list them all:From p=2:10,14,22,26,34,38,46,58,62,74,82,86,94.That's 13 numbers.From p=3:15,21,33,39,51,57,69,87,93.That's 9 numbers.From p=5:35,55,65,85,95.That's 5 numbers.From p=7:77,91.That's 2 numbers.Total:13+9+5+2=29.Yes, that seems consistent.Therefore, the number of remarkable two-digit numbers is 29.**Final Answer**The number of remarkable two-digit numbers is boxed{29}."},{"question":"Carlos is a soccer enthusiast living in Casa Grande, Arizona, and he is planning to organize a local soccer tournament. He wants to rent a field for the tournament and has found a local facility that charges a rental fee based on the number of hours the field is used. The rental fee is given by the polynomial ( f(h) = 4h^2 - 20h + 150 ), where ( h ) represents the number of hours the field is used.1. Determine the number of hours ( h ) that minimizes the rental fee. Use the vertex form of the quadratic equation to solve this sub-problem.2. Carlos expects at least 50 players to participate in the tournament, and he plans to use the field for 3 hours. If each player pays an entry fee of 10, set up and solve an inequality to determine whether the total entry fees collected will cover the rental cost.","answer":"Alright, so Carlos wants to organize a soccer tournament and needs to figure out the best way to minimize the rental fee for the field. The rental fee is given by the polynomial ( f(h) = 4h^2 - 20h + 150 ), where ( h ) is the number of hours the field is used. First, he needs to determine the number of hours ( h ) that will minimize this rental fee. I remember that quadratic equations have a vertex which can be a minimum or maximum point depending on the coefficient. Since the coefficient of ( h^2 ) is positive (4), the parabola opens upwards, meaning the vertex will be the minimum point. So, the vertex will give us the minimum rental fee.To find the vertex, I think we can use the formula for the vertex of a parabola, which is ( h = -frac{b}{2a} ) for a quadratic equation in standard form ( ax^2 + bx + c ). In this case, ( a = 4 ) and ( b = -20 ). Plugging these into the formula:( h = -frac{-20}{2*4} = frac{20}{8} = 2.5 ).So, the number of hours that minimizes the rental fee is 2.5 hours. That makes sense because the vertex is halfway between the roots, and since the parabola opens upwards, this is indeed the minimum point.Now, moving on to the second part. Carlos expects at least 50 players to participate, and he plans to use the field for 3 hours. Each player pays an entry fee of 10. He wants to know if the total entry fees will cover the rental cost.First, let's calculate the rental cost for 3 hours. Using the given polynomial:( f(3) = 4*(3)^2 - 20*(3) + 150 ).Calculating each term:( 4*(9) = 36 ),( -20*3 = -60 ),So, ( 36 - 60 + 150 = (36 - 60) + 150 = (-24) + 150 = 126 ).So, the rental fee for 3 hours is 126.Next, let's calculate the total entry fees. If there are at least 50 players, and each pays 10, then the total entry fee is:Total entry fee = Number of players * Entry fee per player.Since he expects at least 50 players, the minimum number is 50. So, the minimum total entry fee is:50 players * 10/player = 500.Wait, that seems high compared to the rental fee of 126. But let me double-check. 50 players at 10 each is indeed 500, which is much more than 126. So, the total entry fees will definitely cover the rental cost.But hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The rental fee is 126 for 3 hours, and the entry fees are 10 per player. If he has at least 50 players, the total entry fees would be 50*10 = 500, which is way more than 126. So, yes, it will cover the rental cost.But perhaps the problem is asking if the entry fees are enough to cover the rental cost, so we need to set up an inequality. Let me think.Let ( p ) be the number of players. Each pays 10, so total entry fees are ( 10p ). The rental cost is 126. We need to find if ( 10p geq 126 ).Since Carlos expects at least 50 players, ( p geq 50 ). So, substituting ( p = 50 ):( 10*50 = 500 geq 126 ), which is true.Therefore, the total entry fees will cover the rental cost.Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the inequality setup. So, setting up the inequality:Total entry fees ≥ Rental cost( 10p geq 126 )Since ( p geq 50 ), then ( 10*50 = 500 geq 126 ), which is true.So, yes, the entry fees will cover the rental cost.I think that's it. The first part gives the minimum rental fee at 2.5 hours, and the second part shows that with 50 players, the entry fees are sufficient to cover the rental cost for 3 hours."},{"question":"An organizational psychologist is designing a leadership training program for a company. The program includes several modules, each with a different focus. The psychologist needs to allocate time for each module such that the total duration of the program is 40 hours. Let ( x ) represent the number of hours allocated to the leadership skills module, which is known to be twice the duration of the emotional intelligence module. The remaining time is allocated to the decision-making module, which is 4 hours longer than the emotional intelligence module.1. Set up a system of equations to represent the situation and solve for the number of hours allocated to each module.2. If the psychologist decides to add another module on conflict resolution, which requires 5 hours, determine the new total duration of the program and how the allocation for the decision-making module should change if the total duration must remain 40 hours.","answer":"First, I need to define the variables for each module. Let ( x ) represent the hours allocated to the leadership skills module, ( y ) for the emotional intelligence module, and ( z ) for the decision-making module.According to the problem, the leadership skills module is twice the duration of the emotional intelligence module, so I can write the equation ( x = 2y ).The decision-making module is 4 hours longer than the emotional intelligence module, which gives me ( z = y + 4 ).The total duration of the program is 40 hours, so the sum of all modules should equal 40: ( x + y + z = 40 ).Next, I'll substitute the expressions for ( x ) and ( z ) from the first two equations into the total duration equation. This gives me ( 2y + y + (y + 4) = 40 ).Combining like terms, the equation simplifies to ( 4y + 4 = 40 ). Subtracting 4 from both sides, I get ( 4y = 36 ), and dividing by 4, I find ( y = 9 ).Now, I can find ( x ) and ( z ) using the values of ( y ). Substituting ( y = 9 ) into ( x = 2y ), I get ( x = 18 ). For ( z ), substituting into ( z = y + 4 ) gives ( z = 13 ).So, the leadership skills module is allocated 18 hours, the emotional intelligence module 9 hours, and the decision-making module 13 hours.For the second part, if a conflict resolution module requiring 5 hours is added, the new total duration becomes ( 40 + 5 = 45 ) hours. To keep the total at 40 hours, the decision-making module's time must be reduced by 5 hours. Therefore, the new allocation for the decision-making module is ( 13 - 5 = 8 ) hours."},{"question":"Inspired by the courage and strategic thinking of a Sergeant, an ex-militant has decided to dedicate his life to peacebuilding by organizing workshops.

How many different ways are there to achieve this?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to select 3 numbers from the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, and their sum has to be an even number that's not less than 10. I need to figure out how many different ways there are to do this. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, let's understand the problem. I have a set of digits from 0 to 9, and I need to choose 3 distinct numbers from this set. The key constraints are that their sum must be even and at least 10. So, I need to count all possible combinations of 3 numbers that satisfy these two conditions.Alright, let's tackle the first part: selecting 3 numbers such that their sum is even. For the sum of numbers to be even, there are a couple of scenarios. Remember, the sum of numbers is even if:1. All three numbers are even.2. Exactly two numbers are odd and one is even.Because adding two odd numbers gives an even number, and adding an even number to that keeps it even. Similarly, adding three even numbers also gives an even number. So, these are the two cases we need to consider.Now, let's figure out how many even and odd numbers are in the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. The even numbers are 0,2,4,6,8, which is 5 numbers. The odd numbers are 1,3,5,7,9, which is also 5 numbers. So, we have 5 even and 5 odd numbers.Case 1: All three numbers are even. So, we need to choose 3 even numbers from the 5 available. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.So, for this case, it's C(5,3). Let me compute that:C(5,3) = 5! / (3! * (5 - 3)!) = (5 * 4 * 3!) / (3! * 2!) = (5 * 4) / 2! = 20 / 2 = 10.So, there are 10 ways to choose 3 even numbers.Case 2: Exactly two numbers are odd and one is even. So, we need to choose 2 odd numbers from the 5 available and 1 even number from the 5 available.The number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers is C(5,2), and the number of ways to choose 1 even number is C(5,1). Since these are independent choices, we multiply them together.Calculating C(5,2):C(5,2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 * 4 * 3!) / (2! * 3!) = (5 * 4) / 2! = 20 / 2 = 10.And C(5,1) is simply 5.So, the total number of ways for this case is 10 * 5 = 50.Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 numbers with an even sum is 10 (from case 1) + 50 (from case 2) = 60.But wait, hold on. The problem also specifies that the sum must be not less than 10. So, we need to exclude those combinations where the sum is even but less than 10.So, I need to find how many of these 60 combinations have a sum less than 10 and subtract that from 60 to get the desired count.Alright, let's figure out how many such combinations have a sum less than 10.First, let's consider the two cases again: all three even numbers, and two odd and one even.Starting with Case 1: All three numbers are even. Let's list all possible combinations of three even numbers and find those whose sum is less than 10.The even numbers are 0,2,4,6,8.We need to choose 3 distinct even numbers. Let's list all possible triplets and compute their sums.1. 0,2,4: sum = 62. 0,2,6: sum = 83. 0,2,8: sum = 104. 0,4,6: sum = 105. 0,4,8: sum = 126. 0,6,8: sum = 147. 2,4,6: sum = 128. 2,4,8: sum = 149. 2,6,8: sum = 1610. 4,6,8: sum = 18Now, let's see which of these sums are less than 10.Looking at the sums:1. 6: less than 102. 8: less than 103. 10: not less than 104. 10: not less than 105. 12: not less than 106. 14: not less than 107. 12: not less than 108. 14: not less than 109. 16: not less than 1010. 18: not less than 10So, only the first two combinations (0,2,4 and 0,2,6) have sums less than 10. Therefore, in Case 1, there are 2 such combinations.Now, moving on to Case 2: Two odd numbers and one even number. Let's figure out how many of these combinations have a sum less than 10.First, let's note that the odd numbers are 1,3,5,7,9, and the even numbers are 0,2,4,6,8.We need to choose 2 odd numbers and 1 even number such that their sum is less than 10.Let me think about how to approach this. Since the sum is two odd numbers plus one even number, let's consider all possible pairs of odd numbers and see what even numbers can be added to them without exceeding a sum of 9.Alternatively, maybe it's more efficient to list all possible triplets and compute their sums, but that might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the possible combinations by considering the possible sums.Wait, let's think about the minimum and maximum possible sums.The smallest two odd numbers are 1 and 3, so their sum is 4. The smallest even number is 0, so the smallest possible sum is 4 + 0 = 4.The largest two odd numbers are 7 and 9, summing to 16. The largest even number is 8, so the largest possible sum is 16 + 8 = 24.But we need sums less than 10. So, the sum can be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.Wait, but since the sum is two odd numbers and one even number, let's note that two odd numbers add up to an even number, and adding an even number keeps it even. So, the sum will be even. Therefore, the possible sums less than 10 are 4, 6, 8.So, the possible sums we need to consider are 4, 6, and 8.So, let's find all triplets where two odd numbers and one even number add up to 4, 6, or 8.Starting with sum = 4.What combinations of two odd numbers and one even number add up to 4?The smallest two odd numbers are 1 and 3, which sum to 4. So, 1 + 3 + 0 = 4.Is there another combination? Let's see. The next possible even number is 2, but 1 + 3 + 2 = 6, which is higher than 4. Similarly, 1 + 3 + 4 = 8, which is also higher. So, the only triplet that sums to 4 is {1,3,0}.So, that's one combination.Next, sum = 6.We need two odd numbers and one even number adding up to 6.Possible pairs of odd numbers:1. 1 and 3: sum = 4. Then, the even number needed is 2, since 4 + 2 = 6. So, triplet {1,3,2}.2. 1 and 5: sum = 6. Then, the even number needed is 0, since 6 + 0 = 6. So, triplet {1,5,0}.3. 3 and 3: but we can't have duplicate numbers, so this is invalid.Wait, are there any other pairs?Wait, 1 and 5 is another pair, but 1 and 5 sum to 6, so adding 0 gives 6.Is there another pair? Let's see, 1 and 1 is invalid, 3 and 3 is invalid, 5 and 5 is invalid. So, only two triplets: {1,3,2} and {1,5,0}.Wait, hold on. Let me check:If we have two odd numbers adding up to 4, then the even number is 2. So, {1,3,2}.If we have two odd numbers adding up to 6, then the even number is 0. So, {1,5,0}.Is there another way to get a sum of 6? For example, could we have two odd numbers adding to 2? But the smallest odd number is 1, so 1 + 1 = 2, but we can't have duplicates. So, no.Alternatively, could we have two odd numbers adding to 8, but then the even number would have to be negative, which isn't in our set. So, no.So, only two triplets for sum = 6.Wait, actually, hold on. Let me think again. If two odd numbers add to 4, then the even number is 2. If two odd numbers add to 6, the even number is 0. Are there any other pairs?Wait, 1 and 3 is the only pair that adds to 4. 1 and 5 is the only pair that adds to 6. 3 and 5 adds to 8, which would require an even number of -2, which isn't possible. So, yes, only two triplets.So, for sum = 6, we have two triplets: {1,3,2} and {1,5,0}.Wait, but hold on. Let me check if {3,5, -2} is possible, but since we don't have negative numbers, that's invalid. So, yes, only two triplets.Now, moving on to sum = 8.We need two odd numbers and one even number adding up to 8.Possible pairs of odd numbers:1. 1 and 3: sum = 4. Then, the even number needed is 4, since 4 + 4 = 8. So, triplet {1,3,4}.2. 1 and 5: sum = 6. Then, the even number needed is 2, since 6 + 2 = 8. So, triplet {1,5,2}.3. 1 and 7: sum = 8. Then, the even number needed is 0, since 8 + 0 = 8. So, triplet {1,7,0}.4. 3 and 5: sum = 8. Then, the even number needed is 0, since 8 + 0 = 8. So, triplet {3,5,0}.5. 3 and 3: invalid, duplicates.6. 5 and 5: invalid, duplicates.7. 7 and 7: invalid, duplicates.So, let's list the triplets:- {1,3,4}- {1,5,2}- {1,7,0}- {3,5,0}Are there any others?Wait, let's check if 3 and 5 is another pair adding to 8, which we have already considered.Is there a pair adding to 10? That would require an even number of -2, which is invalid.So, four triplets for sum = 8.Wait, let me verify:1. 1 + 3 + 4 = 82. 1 + 5 + 2 = 83. 1 + 7 + 0 = 84. 3 + 5 + 0 = 8Yes, that's four triplets.Is there another pair?Wait, 3 + 7 = 10, which would require an even number of -2, which is invalid.Similarly, 5 + 7 = 12, which would require an even number of -4, invalid.So, no more triplets.Therefore, for sum = 8, we have four triplets.So, in total, for Case 2, the number of triplets with sum less than 10 is:- Sum = 4: 1 triplet- Sum = 6: 2 triplets- Sum = 8: 4 tripletsTotal: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 triplets.Wait, hold on. Let me recount:Sum = 4: {1,3,0} → 1 tripletSum = 6: {1,3,2}, {1,5,0} → 2 tripletsSum = 8: {1,3,4}, {1,5,2}, {1,7,0}, {3,5,0} → 4 tripletsTotal: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 triplets.But wait, hold on. Let me make sure that all these triplets are unique and don't have duplicates.Looking at the triplets:1. {1,3,0}2. {1,3,2}3. {1,5,0}4. {1,3,4}5. {1,5,2}6. {1,7,0}7. {3,5,0}Yes, all are unique. So, 7 triplets in total.Therefore, in Case 2, we have 7 triplets where the sum is less than 10.So, in total, across both cases, the number of triplets with even sums less than 10 is 2 (from Case 1) + 7 (from Case 2) = 9.Therefore, the total number of triplets with even sums is 60, as calculated earlier. So, the number of triplets with even sums not less than 10 is 60 - 9 = 51.Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.Wait, in Case 1, we had 10 triplets, 2 of which had sums less than 10. So, 10 - 2 = 8 triplets with sums >=10.In Case 2, we had 50 triplets, 7 of which had sums less than 10. So, 50 - 7 = 43 triplets with sums >=10.Therefore, total triplets with even sums >=10 is 8 + 43 = 51.Yes, that seems correct.But let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount.Starting with Case 1:Total triplets: 10Triplets with sum <10: 2So, triplets with sum >=10: 8Case 2:Total triplets: 50Triplets with sum <10: 7So, triplets with sum >=10: 43Total: 8 + 43 = 51Yes, that seems consistent.But let me cross-verify this another way. Instead of subtracting the bad cases, maybe I can compute directly the number of triplets with even sums >=10.But that might be more complicated, but let's try.For Case 1: All even numbers.We have triplets with even sums >=10.From earlier, the triplets with even sums are:0,2,4:60,2,6:80,2,8:100,4,6:100,4,8:120,6,8:142,4,6:122,4,8:142,6,8:164,6,8:18So, sums >=10 are:0,2,8:100,4,6:100,4,8:120,6,8:142,4,6:122,4,8:142,6,8:164,6,8:18So, that's 8 triplets, which matches our earlier count.For Case 2: Two odd, one even.We need to count triplets where the sum is even and >=10.But instead of listing all 50 triplets, which would be time-consuming, perhaps we can compute how many have sums >=10.Alternatively, since we already know that 7 triplets have sums <10, subtracting from 50 gives 43, which is the number of triplets with sums >=10.Therefore, the total is 8 + 43 = 51.So, I think 51 is the correct answer.But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach.Total number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 10: C(10,3) = 120.Number of triplets with even sums: 60 (as calculated earlier).Number of triplets with odd sums: 120 - 60 = 60.But we need the number of triplets with even sums >=10.Which is 60 - number of triplets with even sums <10.We found that number to be 9, so 60 - 9 = 51.Yes, that's consistent.Alternatively, if I think about the number of triplets with even sums <10, which is 9, as before.Therefore, the number of triplets with even sums >=10 is 51.Therefore, the answer is 51.But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the triplets with sums <10 in Case 2.Earlier, I found 7 triplets:1. {1,3,0}2. {1,3,2}3. {1,5,0}4. {1,3,4}5. {1,5,2}6. {1,7,0}7. {3,5,0}Let me verify each of these:1. {1,3,0}: sum = 42. {1,3,2}: sum = 63. {1,5,0}: sum = 64. {1,3,4}: sum = 85. {1,5,2}: sum = 86. {1,7,0}: sum = 87. {3,5,0}: sum = 8Yes, all these sums are indeed less than 10, and they are all unique triplets.So, 7 triplets in Case 2, and 2 in Case 1, totaling 9 triplets with even sums <10.Therefore, subtracting 9 from 60 gives 51 triplets with even sums >=10.Therefore, the answer is 51.I think that's solid.**Final Answer**The number of different ways is boxed{51}."},{"question":"Determine all pairs of positive integers ((m, n)) such that (2^m - 1 = 3^n).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem: find all pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that 2^m - 1 equals 3^n. Hmm, okay. Let me try to wrap my head around this.First, let's write down the equation:2^m - 1 = 3^n.I need to find positive integers m and n that satisfy this. So, m and n are both at least 1. Let me start by plugging in small values for m and n to see if I can find any solutions.Let's try m = 1:2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. So, 1 = 3^n. That would mean n = 0, but n has to be positive. So, m = 1 doesn't work.Next, m = 2:2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. So, 3 = 3^n. That means n = 1. Okay, so (2, 1) is a solution.Let me check m = 3:2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7. 7 is not a power of 3, so no solution here.m = 4:2^4 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15. 15 isn't a power of 3 either. 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, so 15 is in between. Not a solution.m = 5:2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31. Again, 31 isn't a power of 3. 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81. So, nope.m = 6:2^6 - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63. Hmm, 63. Let's see, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81. 63 is 3^2 * 7, so not a pure power of 3. So, no solution here.m = 7:2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127. 127 is a prime number, I think. Not a power of 3.m = 8:2^8 - 1 = 256 - 1 = 255. 255 is 3 * 5 * 17. Not a power of 3.m = 9:2^9 - 1 = 512 - 1 = 511. 511 is 7 * 73. Not a power of 3.m = 10:2^10 - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023. 1023 is 3 * 11 * 31. Still not a power of 3.Hmm, so far, only m = 2 gives a solution. Maybe I should try higher m, but this might take a while. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or use some number theory to solve this.Let me think about the equation again:2^m = 3^n + 1.So, 2^m is one more than a power of 3. I know that powers of 3 are always odd, so 3^n is odd, so 3^n + 1 is even, which makes sense because 2^m is even.But maybe I can consider modulo something. Let's see.Looking at the equation modulo 3:2^m ≡ 1 mod 3.Because 3^n is 0 mod 3, so 2^m ≡ 1 mod 3.What is 2 mod 3? It's 2. So, 2^1 ≡ 2 mod 3.2^2 ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3.2^3 ≡ 8 ≡ 2 mod 3.2^4 ≡ 16 ≡ 1 mod 3.So, the pattern is that 2^m mod 3 cycles between 2 and 1 every exponent. So, when m is even, 2^m ≡ 1 mod 3, and when m is odd, 2^m ≡ 2 mod 3.But in our equation, 2^m ≡ 1 mod 3, so m must be even. So, m is even. Let me write m = 2k for some positive integer k.So, substituting back, we have:2^{2k} - 1 = 3^n.Which can be written as:(2^k)^2 - 1 = 3^n.Which factors as:(2^k - 1)(2^k + 1) = 3^n.So, the product of two consecutive even numbers (since 2^k is even, so 2^k -1 and 2^k +1 are consecutive odd numbers) is equal to a power of 3.But since 3^n is a prime power, its only factors are powers of 3. So, both (2^k -1) and (2^k +1) must themselves be powers of 3.Let me denote:Let a = 2^k - 1 and b = 2^k + 1, so that a * b = 3^n.Since a and b are two consecutive even numbers (wait, actually, 2^k is even, so 2^k -1 and 2^k +1 are consecutive odd numbers, right? So, they are two apart, both odd.So, a and b are two consecutive odd numbers, and their product is a power of 3. Since 3 is prime, both a and b must themselves be powers of 3.So, let's write:a = 3^s and b = 3^t, where s and t are positive integers with s < t, because a < b.Also, since a * b = 3^n, we have 3^s * 3^t = 3^{s + t} = 3^n, so s + t = n.Also, since b = a + 2, we have:3^t = 3^s + 2.So, 3^t - 3^s = 2.Factor out 3^s:3^s (3^{t - s} - 1) = 2.Now, 3^s and (3^{t - s} - 1) are both positive integers, and their product is 2.Since 2 is prime, the possible factorizations are:Case 1: 3^s = 1 and (3^{t - s} - 1) = 2.Case 2: 3^s = 2 and (3^{t - s} - 1) = 1.But 3^s = 2 is impossible because 3^s is a power of 3, which can't be 2.So, only Case 1 is possible.Case 1: 3^s = 1 and (3^{t - s} - 1) = 2.So, 3^s = 1 implies s = 0, but s is a positive integer? Wait, hold on. Wait, in the beginning, I said s and t are positive integers, but if s = 0, that would make a = 3^0 = 1, which is allowed because a = 2^k - 1 must be at least 1 when k is at least 1.Wait, but in the original problem, m and n are positive integers, so k is a positive integer as m = 2k.So, s can be zero? Let me check.Wait, a = 2^k - 1. If k = 1, then a = 1, which is 3^0. So, s can be zero.But in the initial step, I considered s and t as positive integers, but maybe s can be zero.So, let's adjust that.So, 3^s = 1 implies s = 0.Then, 3^{t - s} - 1 = 2, so 3^{t} - 1 = 2, because s = 0.So, 3^t = 3.Thus, t = 1.So, s = 0 and t = 1.Therefore, a = 3^0 = 1 and b = 3^1 = 3.So, 2^k - 1 = 1 and 2^k + 1 = 3.Let me solve for k:From 2^k - 1 = 1: 2^k = 2, so k = 1.From 2^k + 1 = 3: 2^k = 2, so k = 1. Consistent.So, k = 1.Therefore, m = 2k = 2*1 = 2.Then, n = s + t = 0 + 1 = 1.So, that gives the solution (2, 1), which we already found earlier.Is there any other solution?Well, in the equation 3^s (3^{t - s} - 1) = 2, the only factorization is 1 * 2, so s must be 0 and t - s must be 1.Hence, the only solution is s = 0, t = 1, leading to m = 2, n = 1.But wait, let me double-check if there could be other solutions. Suppose s is not zero, but then 3^s would have to be a divisor of 2, which is only possible if 3^s = 1 or 3^s = 2. But 3^s can't be 2, so only 3^s = 1, which is s = 0.Therefore, there are no other solutions.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using logarithms or inequalities.Let me see, 2^m = 3^n + 1.For m > 2, 2^m grows faster than 3^n, but maybe for small exponents, they can intersect.Wait, but we already saw that for m = 2, n = 1 is a solution.Let me check m = 4: 2^4 = 16, 3^n + 1 = 16, so 3^n = 15. Not a power of 3.m = 3: 8 = 3^n + 1, so 3^n = 7. Not a power.m = 5: 32 = 3^n + 1, so 3^n = 31. Not a power.m = 6: 64 = 3^n + 1, so 3^n = 63. 63 is 3^2 * 7, not a power.m = 7: 128 = 3^n + 1, so 3^n = 127. Not a power.m = 8: 256 = 3^n + 1, so 3^n = 255. Not a power.m = 9: 512 = 3^n + 1, so 3^n = 511. Not a power.m = 10: 1024 = 3^n + 1, so 3^n = 1023. Not a power.So, seems like only m = 2 works.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the equation modulo 4.2^m mod 4: For m >= 2, 2^m ≡ 0 mod 4. For m = 1, 2 mod 4.3^n mod 4: 3 ≡ -1 mod 4, so 3^n ≡ (-1)^n mod 4.So, 2^m - 1 ≡ (-1)^n mod 4.If m >= 2, then 2^m ≡ 0 mod 4, so 2^m -1 ≡ -1 mod 4.Thus, (-1)^n ≡ -1 mod 4, which implies that n is odd.So, n must be odd.If m = 1, 2^1 -1 = 1, which would require 3^n = 1, so n = 0, which isn't positive. So, m must be at least 2, and n must be odd.So, n is odd.So, n = 2k + 1 for some integer k >= 0.But n is positive, so k >= 0.So, 3^n = 3^{2k + 1} = 3 * 9^k.So, 2^m -1 = 3 * 9^k.So, 2^m = 3 * 9^k + 1.Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can write 9^k as (3^2)^k = 3^{2k}.So, 2^m = 3^{2k + 1} + 1.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the equation modulo 8.2^m mod 8: For m >= 3, 2^m ≡ 0 mod 8. For m = 1, 2 mod 8; m = 2, 4 mod 8.3^n mod 8: Let's compute 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9 ≡ 1 mod 8, 3^3 = 27 ≡ 3 mod 8, 3^4 = 81 ≡ 1 mod 8. So, 3^n cycles between 3 and 1 mod 8.So, 3^n ≡ 3 mod 8 when n is odd, and 1 mod 8 when n is even.But from earlier, we saw that n must be odd, so 3^n ≡ 3 mod 8.Thus, 2^m -1 ≡ 3 mod 8.So, 2^m ≡ 4 mod 8.Which implies that m must be 2, because 2^2 = 4 ≡ 4 mod 8. For m > 2, 2^m ≡ 0 mod 8, so 2^m -1 ≡ 7 mod 8, which is not equal to 3 mod 8.Wait, so if m >= 3, 2^m -1 ≡ 7 mod 8, but 3^n ≡ 3 mod 8, so 7 ≡ 3 mod 8? That's not possible.Therefore, m cannot be greater than or equal to 3. So, m must be less than 3.But m is a positive integer, so m can be 1 or 2.We already saw that m = 1 gives n = 0, which is invalid, and m = 2 gives n = 1, which is valid.Therefore, the only solution is (2, 1).So, that seems to confirm it.Alternatively, another approach: Catalan's conjecture, now Mihăilescu's theorem, which states that the only solution in the natural numbers of x^a - y^b = 1 for x, y, a, b > 1 is x = 3, a = 2, y = 2, b = 3. So, 3^2 - 2^3 = 1.But in our case, it's 2^m - 3^n = 1. So, similar but not the same. Mihăilescu's theorem tells us that the only consecutive perfect powers are 8 and 9, which are 2^3 and 3^2.But in our equation, 2^m - 3^n = 1, so 2^m = 3^n + 1.Looking at Mihăilescu's theorem, the only solution to x^a - y^b = 1 with x, y, a, b > 1 is 3^2 - 2^3 = 1. So, that would correspond to x = 3, a = 2, y = 2, b = 3.But in our case, it's 2^m - 3^n = 1, so it's the reverse. So, 2^m = 3^n + 1.So, unless 2^m and 3^n are consecutive perfect powers, but according to Mihăilescu's theorem, the only consecutive perfect powers are 8 and 9, which are 2^3 and 3^2.So, in our case, 2^m = 3^n + 1.If 2^m and 3^n are consecutive, then 2^m = 9 and 3^n = 8, but 3^n = 8 implies n is not an integer because 8 is not a power of 3.Alternatively, 2^m = 8 and 3^n = 7, but 7 isn't a power of 3.Wait, but according to Mihăilescu's theorem, the only solution is 3^2 - 2^3 = 1, so 9 - 8 = 1. So, that would correspond to 3^2 = 2^3 + 1, which is 9 = 8 + 1.So, in our equation, 2^m - 3^n = 1, the only solution would be 2^3 - 3^2 = 8 - 9 = -1, which is not 1. So, that doesn't fit.Wait, but in our case, 2^m - 3^n = 1, so 2^m = 3^n + 1.Looking at Mihăilescu's theorem, the only solution to x^a - y^b = 1 is 3^2 - 2^3 = 1. So, in our case, it's 2^m - 3^n = 1, which would require that 2^m = 3^n + 1. So, unless 2^m and 3^n are consecutive perfect powers, which only happens at 8 and 9, but 8 is 2^3 and 9 is 3^2, but 8 - 9 = -1, which is not 1. So, that doesn't help.But perhaps, since Mihăilescu's theorem tells us that 8 and 9 are the only consecutive perfect powers, so 2^m and 3^n can't be consecutive unless they are 8 and 9, which don't satisfy our equation. Therefore, the only solution is when 2^m - 3^n = 1 is trivial, which is when m = 2, n = 1.So, that seems to confirm it again.Alternatively, maybe I can use bounds.Suppose that m >= 3 and n >= 2.Then, 2^m = 3^n + 1.We can take logarithms:m * ln 2 = ln(3^n + 1).But 3^n + 1 < 3^n + 3^n = 2 * 3^n for n >= 1.So, m * ln 2 < ln(2 * 3^n) = ln 2 + n ln 3.Thus,m < (ln 2 + n ln 3) / ln 2 = 1 + n (ln 3 / ln 2).Similarly, 3^n + 1 > 3^n, so m * ln 2 > n ln 3.Thus,m > n (ln 3 / ln 2).So, combining both,n (ln 3 / ln 2) < m < 1 + n (ln 3 / ln 2).But ln 3 / ln 2 is approximately 1.58496.So, m is between approximately 1.58496 n and 1 + 1.58496 n.So, m is roughly 1.58496 n.But m and n are integers, so for each n, m is approximately 1.58496 n.But let's see for n = 1, m = 2: 1.58496 * 1 ≈ 1.58496, so m = 2 is just above that.For n = 2, m would be approximately 3.16992, so m = 3 or 4.But 2^3 -1 = 7 ≠ 9, and 2^4 -1 = 15 ≠ 9.n = 3: m ≈ 4.75488, so m = 5.2^5 -1 = 31 ≠ 27.n = 4: m ≈ 6.33984, so m = 6.2^6 -1 = 63 ≠ 81.n = 5: m ≈ 7.9248, so m = 8.2^8 -1 = 255 ≠ 243.n = 6: m ≈ 9.50976, so m = 10.2^10 -1 = 1023 ≠ 729.So, as n increases, 3^n grows exponentially, but 2^m grows as well, but the ratio is such that 2^m can't catch up to 3^n +1 except for small exponents.Alternatively, maybe I can use inequalities.Suppose that n >= 2.Then, 3^n = (3^2)^{n/2} = 9^{n/2}.So, 2^m = 9^{n/2} + 1.But 9^{n/2} is an integer only if n is even, but n is odd as we saw earlier.Wait, no, 9^{n/2} is integer if n is even, but n is odd, so 9^{n/2} is not an integer. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't helpful.Alternatively, maybe I can write 2^m = 3^n + 1 and factor 3^n + 1.But 3^n + 1 can be factored only if n is even, because 3^n +1 = (3^{n/2})^2 + 1, which doesn't factor over integers. If n is odd, 3^n +1 can be factored as (3 + 1)(3^{n-1} - 3^{n-2} + ... - 3 + 1). So, for n odd, 3^n +1 is divisible by 4.Wait, let's see:If n is odd, 3^n +1 is divisible by 3 + 1 = 4.Indeed, 3 ≡ -1 mod 4, so 3^n ≡ (-1)^n mod 4. Since n is odd, 3^n ≡ -1 mod 4, so 3^n +1 ≡ 0 mod 4.So, 2^m is divisible by 4, which it is for m >= 2.But 2^m = 3^n +1, so 3^n +1 must be a power of 2.So, 3^n +1 is a power of 2.So, let's denote 3^n +1 = 2^m.So, 3^n = 2^m -1.So, 3^n is one less than a power of 2.So, 3^n +1 = 2^m.So, 3^n = 2^m -1.So, similar to before.So, 3^n is a Mersenne number, which is one less than a power of 2.Known Mersenne primes are primes of the form 2^p -1, but 3^n is not necessarily prime unless n =1.Wait, 3^n is prime only when n=1, since 3 is prime and 3^n is prime only if n=1.So, 3^n is prime only for n=1, which gives 3.So, 3^n is composite for n >=2.So, 2^m -1 must be composite for n >=2.But 2^m -1 can be prime or composite.But in our case, 2^m -1 = 3^n, which is composite for n >=2.So, 2^m -1 is composite, so m must be composite? Wait, no, 2^m -1 can be prime even if m is composite, but actually, if m is composite, 2^m -1 is composite. Wait, no, the converse is true: if m is prime, 2^m -1 can be prime (a Mersenne prime), but if m is composite, 2^m -1 is composite.But in our case, 2^m -1 is equal to 3^n, which is composite for n >=2.So, if n >=2, then 2^m -1 is composite, so m must be composite.But m is even, as we saw earlier, since m must be even for 2^m ≡1 mod 3.Wait, m is even, so m = 2k.So, 2^{2k} -1 = (2^k -1)(2^k +1) = 3^n.So, as we saw earlier, both factors are powers of 3.So, 2^k -1 = 3^s and 2^k +1 = 3^t, with t > s and s + t = n.And 3^t - 3^s = 2.So, 3^s (3^{t - s} -1 ) = 2.Which only has the solution s =0, t =1, leading to k=1, m=2, n=1.Therefore, the only solution is (2,1).So, after considering multiple approaches—plugging in small numbers, modular arithmetic, Mihăilescu's theorem, factoring, inequalities—it seems that the only solution is m=2 and n=1.**Final Answer**The only solution is boxed{(2, 1)}."},{"question":"As a union leader, you have been advocating for fair wages for workers. You've discovered that the wage increase over the years can be modeled by a quadratic equation based on the number of years since you started your advocacy. The equation is given by ( W(t) = -2t^2 + 20t + 30 ), where ( W(t) ) represents the wage increase in dollars, and ( t ) represents the number of years since you began your fight for workers' rights.1. Determine the number of years after you started when the wage increase reached its maximum value. What was the maximum wage increase?2. Due to economic challenges, the government proposes a new policy that could potentially reduce the wage increase by a constant 10 every year. Modify the original equation to reflect this change and determine the new maximum wage increase and how many years it will take to reach this maximum under the new policy.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about wage increases modeled by a quadratic equation. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the equation given is ( W(t) = -2t^2 + 20t + 30 ). I remember that quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola is the maximum point. So, the maximum wage increase occurs at the vertex of this quadratic function.To find the vertex, I recall that the formula for the time ( t ) at which the vertex occurs is ( t = -frac{b}{2a} ). In this equation, ( a = -2 ) and ( b = 20 ). Plugging those values in:( t = -frac{20}{2*(-2)} )( t = -frac{20}{-4} )( t = 5 )So, the maximum wage increase happens 5 years after starting the advocacy. Now, to find the maximum wage increase, I need to plug this value of ( t ) back into the original equation.Calculating ( W(5) ):( W(5) = -2(5)^2 + 20(5) + 30 )( W(5) = -2(25) + 100 + 30 )( W(5) = -50 + 100 + 30 )( W(5) = 80 )So, the maximum wage increase is 80 after 5 years.Moving on to the second part. The government proposes a new policy that reduces the wage increase by a constant 10 every year. Hmm, so this is a linear decrease on top of the quadratic model. I need to modify the original equation to reflect this change.The original equation is ( W(t) = -2t^2 + 20t + 30 ). If the wage increase is reduced by 10 each year, that would be subtracting 10t from the equation, right? Because each year, the reduction increases by 10. So, the new equation should be:( W_{text{new}}(t) = -2t^2 + 20t + 30 - 10t )Simplify that:( W_{text{new}}(t) = -2t^2 + (20t - 10t) + 30 )( W_{text{new}}(t) = -2t^2 + 10t + 30 )Now, I need to find the new maximum wage increase and the time it takes to reach this maximum. Again, since the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is negative, the parabola opens downward, so the vertex is the maximum.Using the vertex formula again, ( t = -frac{b}{2a} ). Here, ( a = -2 ) and ( b = 10 ).Calculating ( t ):( t = -frac{10}{2*(-2)} )( t = -frac{10}{-4} )( t = 2.5 )So, the maximum wage increase under the new policy occurs at 2.5 years. Now, let's find the maximum wage increase by plugging ( t = 2.5 ) into the new equation.Calculating ( W_{text{new}}(2.5) ):( W_{text{new}}(2.5) = -2(2.5)^2 + 10(2.5) + 30 )First, compute ( (2.5)^2 ):( 2.5 * 2.5 = 6.25 )Now, plug that back in:( W_{text{new}}(2.5) = -2(6.25) + 25 + 30 )( W_{text{new}}(2.5) = -12.5 + 25 + 30 )( W_{text{new}}(2.5) = (-12.5 + 25) + 30 )( W_{text{new}}(2.5) = 12.5 + 30 )( W_{text{new}}(2.5) = 42.5 )So, the new maximum wage increase is 42.50, occurring at 2.5 years.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the new equation: ( -2t^2 + 10t + 30 ). At t=2.5:-2*(2.5)^2 = -2*6.25 = -12.510*(2.5) = 25Adding 30: -12.5 + 25 + 30 = 42.5. Yeah, that seems right.So, the maximum wage increase is now 42.50, achieved at 2.5 years instead of 5 years as before.I think that's all. Let me just recap:1. Original maximum at t=5, wage increase 80.2. After the policy, new maximum at t=2.5, wage increase 42.50.Yeah, that makes sense. The policy reduces the wage increase each year, so the peak happens earlier and is lower.**Final Answer**1. The maximum wage increase of boxed{80} dollars occurred after boxed{5} years.2.

The L-shape is placed inside a rectangle so that all five vertices of the L-shape lie on the rectangle, one of them at the midpoint of an edge, as shown.What is the area of the rectangle?A 16B 18C 20D 22E 24","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are three squares, each with side-lengths of 2 units, placed together edge-to-edge to form an L-shape. Then, this L-shape is placed inside a rectangle such that all five vertices of the L-shape lie on the rectangle, with one of them at the midpoint of an edge. I need to find the area of the rectangle, and the options are 16, 18, 20, 22, or 24.First, let me visualize the L-shape. Since each square has a side length of 2, the L-shape will consist of three squares connected at their edges. So, it's like two squares forming a corner, and the third square attached to one of them, extending either horizontally or vertically. Depending on how it's placed, the L-shape can have different dimensions.But since the L-shape is placed inside a rectangle with all five vertices on the rectangle, one of them at the midpoint of an edge, I need to figure out the dimensions of the rectangle. The area will then be length multiplied by width.Let me try to sketch this mentally. If the L-shape is made by three squares, each of size 2x2, then the overall dimensions of the L-shape can be calculated. If two squares are placed side by side horizontally, that would make a 4x2 rectangle, and then the third square is placed on top of one end, making an L-shape. So, the vertical part would be 2 units high and 2 units wide, and the horizontal part would be 4 units long and 2 units wide.But wait, if it's an L-shape, the total dimensions would be 4 units in length and 2 units in height on one side, and 2 units in length and 2 units in height on the other. So, the overall bounding box for the L-shape would be 4 units by 4 units, but that might not necessarily be the case because it's placed inside a rectangle with all five vertices on the rectangle.Wait, actually, the L-shape has five vertices. Let me count them: the corner where the two squares meet, and then each square contributes three vertices, but some are shared. So, the L-shape has five vertices in total.Now, placing this L-shape inside a rectangle such that all five vertices lie on the rectangle, with one of them at the midpoint of an edge. Hmm, so one of the five vertices is at the midpoint of one of the rectangle's edges.I think it would help to draw a rough sketch. Since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. Let's assume the rectangle is placed with its sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Let me assign coordinates to the L-shape.Let me place the L-shape such that the corner is at the origin (0,0). Then, the horizontal part goes from (0,0) to (4,0), and the vertical part goes from (0,0) to (0,2). So, the five vertices of the L-shape are at (0,0), (4,0), (2,0), (0,2), and (2,2). Wait, is that correct?Wait, no. If it's three squares, each of side length 2, then the horizontal part is two squares, so from (0,0) to (4,0), and the vertical part is one square, from (0,0) to (0,2). So, the vertices would be at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), and (0,2). Wait, that's five vertices.So, the L-shape has vertices at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), and (0,2). Now, if we place this inside a rectangle such that all five vertices lie on the rectangle, with one of them at the midpoint of an edge.Looking at these coordinates, the midpoints of the rectangle's edges would be at the midpoints of the top, bottom, left, and right sides.So, if the rectangle has width W and height H, the midpoints would be at (W/2, 0), (W/2, H), (0, H/2), and (W, H/2).Now, one of the L-shape's vertices is at a midpoint. Let's see which one could be.Looking at the L-shape's vertices: (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2). So, (0,0) is a corner, (4,0) is another corner, (4,2) is another, (2,2) is the middle of the top part, and (0,2) is another corner.So, one of these points is at the midpoint of the rectangle's edge. Let's consider each possibility.Case 1: (0,0) is at the midpoint of the rectangle's edge. But (0,0) is a corner of the L-shape, so if it's at the midpoint of the rectangle's edge, that would mean the rectangle's edge is longer than the L-shape's side.But since the rectangle must contain the entire L-shape, this might not be the case. Let's think.Alternatively, maybe (2,2) is at the midpoint of the rectangle's top edge. So, if (2,2) is the midpoint, then the top edge of the rectangle would have midpoint at (2,2). Therefore, the top edge would be from (0,2) to (4,2), which is the same as the L-shape's top edge. But in that case, the rectangle's top edge would coincide with the L-shape's top edge, but the L-shape's top edge is only 2 units long, from (0,2) to (2,2). Wait, no, actually, in my coordinate system, the L-shape's top edge is from (0,2) to (2,2), which is 2 units.Wait, but if (2,2) is the midpoint of the rectangle's top edge, then the top edge must extend from (0,2) to (4,2), making the top edge 4 units long. But in the L-shape, the top edge is only 2 units. So, that would mean the rectangle's top edge is longer than the L-shape's top edge, which is possible.But then, the rectangle would have a top edge from (0,2) to (4,2), so the width of the rectangle would be 4 units. The height would be from y=0 to y=2, so height is 2 units. But then, the rectangle would be 4x2, but the L-shape is already 4x2 in the horizontal direction and 2 units in the vertical direction. However, the L-shape also has a vertical part from (0,0) to (0,2). So, if the rectangle is 4x2, then the L-shape would fit perfectly, but in that case, all the vertices of the L-shape would lie on the rectangle's edges or corners.But wait, in that case, the rectangle is 4x2, area 8, but the options are 16, 18, 20, 22, 24. So, that can't be.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is larger. Maybe the L-shape is placed such that one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's side, but not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes.Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the rectangle is not axis-aligned with the L-shape. Maybe the L-shape is rotated or placed in a way that one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's edge, but the rectangle is larger.Alternatively, perhaps the L-shape is placed such that one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's longer side.Wait, let me think again. The L-shape has vertices at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), and (0,2). If one of these is at the midpoint of the rectangle's edge, let's see:- If (0,0) is at the midpoint of the bottom edge, then the bottom edge would be from (-2,0) to (2,0), but that would place the L-shape outside the rectangle on the left side, which isn't allowed.- If (4,0) is at the midpoint of the bottom edge, then the bottom edge would be from (2,0) to (6,0), but then the L-shape's vertex at (0,0) would be outside the rectangle on the left, which isn't allowed.- If (0,2) is at the midpoint of the left edge, then the left edge would be from (0,0) to (0,4), but the L-shape's vertex at (0,0) would be at the bottom of the left edge, which is allowed, but then the rectangle's left edge is from (0,0) to (0,4). Similarly, the top edge would be from (0,4) to (W,4). But then, the L-shape's vertex at (4,2) would be inside the rectangle, but we need all five vertices on the rectangle. So, (4,2) would have to lie on the rectangle's edge. If the rectangle's top edge is at y=4, then (4,2) is below that, so it can't be on the top edge. Similarly, the right edge would be at x=W, but (4,2) is somewhere inside, unless W=4, but then the right edge is at x=4, and (4,2) is on the right edge. So, let's see:If (0,2) is at the midpoint of the left edge, then the left edge is from (0,0) to (0,4). Then, the right edge is at x=W, which must include the L-shape's vertex at (4,2). So, if (4,2) is on the right edge, then the right edge is at x=4, so W=4. Then, the top edge is from (0,4) to (4,4), and the bottom edge is from (0,0) to (4,0). Now, the L-shape's vertices are:(0,0) - on the bottom-left corner.(4,0) - on the bottom edge at (4,0), which is the midpoint? Wait, the bottom edge is from (0,0) to (4,0), so the midpoint is at (2,0). But (4,0) is an endpoint, not the midpoint. So, (4,0) is on the bottom edge, but not at the midpoint.Similarly, (4,2) is on the right edge at (4,2), which is the midpoint of the right edge if the right edge is from (4,0) to (4,4). The midpoint would be at (4,2), so that's correct. So, (4,2) is at the midpoint of the right edge.Then, (2,2) is somewhere inside the rectangle, but it's supposed to be on the rectangle's edge. Wait, but in this case, (2,2) is not on any edge of the rectangle, because the rectangle's edges are at x=0, x=4, y=0, y=4. So, (2,2) is inside, not on the edge. That's a problem because all five vertices must lie on the rectangle.So, this configuration doesn't work because (2,2) is inside the rectangle, not on the edge.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is taller. Let me think.Suppose the rectangle has height H and width W. The L-shape is placed such that all five vertices lie on the rectangle, with one vertex at the midpoint of an edge.Let me try to assign coordinates again, but perhaps with the rectangle not necessarily axis-aligned with the L-shape.Wait, maybe the rectangle is rotated. If the L-shape is placed inside a rectangle that's rotated, then the coordinates would be different.Alternatively, perhaps the L-shape is placed such that one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's top edge, and another at the midpoint of the right edge, etc.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is such that the L-shape is inscribed in it, with all five vertices on the rectangle, and one of them is at the midpoint.Wait, another thought: since the L-shape has three squares, each of area 4, so total area is 12. The rectangle must have an area larger than 12, but the options are 16, 18, 20, 22, 24. So, the area is one of these.But the area of the rectangle is length times width. So, if I can find the dimensions, I can compute the area.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is twice the size in both directions, but that might not necessarily be the case.Wait, another approach: since the L-shape is made of three squares, each of side 2, the maximum horizontal extent is 4 units, and the maximum vertical extent is 2 units. But if the L-shape is placed such that one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's edge, maybe the rectangle is larger in one dimension.Wait, perhaps the rectangle is 6 units long and 4 units high, making the area 24. But 24 is an option, but I need to verify.Alternatively, maybe it's 5 units by 4 units, area 20.Wait, let me think about the coordinates again.If the L-shape is placed such that one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's edge, let's say the midpoint of the top edge. So, if the top edge is at y=H, then the midpoint is at (W/2, H). If one of the L-shape's vertices is at (W/2, H), then that vertex must be one of the five: (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2).So, if (2,2) is at (W/2, H), then W/2=2 and H=2. So, W=4 and H=2. But then the rectangle is 4x2, which is too small because the L-shape's vertex at (4,0) would be on the bottom edge, but (4,0) is at the midpoint of the bottom edge if W=4. So, the bottom edge is from (0,0) to (4,0), midpoint at (2,0). But (4,0) is an endpoint, not the midpoint. So, that doesn't satisfy the condition that one vertex is at the midpoint.Alternatively, if (4,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge, then W/2=4 and H=2. So, W=8 and H=2. Then, the rectangle is 8x2, area 16. But then, the L-shape's vertices are at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2). So, (0,0) is on the bottom-left corner, (4,0) is on the bottom edge at (4,0), which is not the midpoint (midpoint is at (4,0) if W=8? Wait, no, midpoint of the top edge is at (4,2), which is where (4,2) is. So, (4,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge. Then, the rectangle is 8 units wide and 2 units tall. But then, the L-shape's vertex at (0,2) is on the left edge at (0,2), which is the midpoint of the left edge if H=2. The midpoint of the left edge is at (0,1), but (0,2) is at the top of the left edge, which is a corner. So, that's okay.But wait, the L-shape's vertex at (0,2) is at the top-left corner of the rectangle, which is a corner, not a midpoint. So, that's acceptable because only one vertex needs to be at the midpoint.But then, let's check if all five vertices lie on the rectangle:- (0,0): bottom-left corner.- (4,0): on the bottom edge at (4,0), which is not the midpoint.- (4,2): midpoint of the top edge.- (2,2): on the top edge at (2,2). Wait, but the top edge is from (0,2) to (8,2). So, (2,2) is somewhere on the top edge, not necessarily a corner or midpoint.But in this case, (2,2) is on the top edge, which is fine because all five vertices must lie on the rectangle.Similarly, (0,2) is on the left edge at (0,2), which is the top-left corner.So, in this configuration, all five vertices lie on the rectangle, with (4,2) at the midpoint of the top edge. The rectangle is 8 units wide and 2 units tall, area 16. But 16 is an option, option A.But wait, is this the minimal rectangle? Because the L-shape is 4 units wide and 2 units tall, but the rectangle is 8 units wide and 2 units tall, which seems unnecessarily wide. Maybe there's a more optimal rectangle.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is placed such that the L-shape is rotated.Wait, if the L-shape is rotated 90 degrees, the dimensions would swap, but the area would remain the same.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is placed such that the L-shape is centered, but I'm not sure.Wait, another thought: if the L-shape is placed inside the rectangle such that one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's side, but the rectangle is not necessarily aligned with the L-shape's sides.In that case, the rectangle could be a different size.Wait, perhaps the rectangle is a square. But the options don't include 16 as a square, since 16 is 4x4, but 16 is an option, but the L-shape is 4x2, so maybe not.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is 6 units by 4 units, area 24.Wait, let me think differently. Let's consider the coordinates of the L-shape again: (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2).If I need to place these points on a rectangle, with one of them at the midpoint of an edge.Let me assume that (2,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge. Then, the top edge would be from (0,2) to (4,2), so the midpoint is at (2,2). Therefore, the rectangle's top edge is from (0,2) to (4,2), so width is 4 units. The height would be from y=0 to y=2, so height is 2 units. But then, the rectangle is 4x2, area 8, which is too small because the L-shape's vertex at (0,0) is at the bottom-left corner, (4,0) is at the bottom-right corner, and (0,2) is at the top-left corner. But then, the L-shape's vertex at (4,2) is at the top-right corner, which is on the rectangle, and (2,2) is the midpoint of the top edge. So, in this case, all five vertices lie on the rectangle, with (2,2) at the midpoint of the top edge. But the area is 8, which is not among the options.Wait, but the problem says the L-shape is placed inside a rectangle, so maybe the rectangle is larger.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is such that the L-shape is placed with one vertex at the midpoint of the rectangle's side, but not necessarily aligned with the L-shape's sides.Wait, maybe the rectangle is placed such that the L-shape is rotated 45 degrees, but that might complicate things.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is 6 units by 4 units, area 24.Wait, let me think about the maximum dimensions. The L-shape has a horizontal extent of 4 units and a vertical extent of 2 units. If the rectangle is placed such that the L-shape is inside, with one vertex at the midpoint of the rectangle's edge, perhaps the rectangle is 6 units long and 4 units wide.Wait, let me try to assign coordinates again.Suppose the rectangle has width W and height H. The L-shape is placed inside such that all five vertices lie on the rectangle, with one vertex at the midpoint of an edge.Let me assume that (2,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge. So, the top edge is from (a, H) to (b, H), and the midpoint is at ((a+b)/2, H) = (2,2). So, (a+b)/2 = 2, so a + b = 4. Also, H = 2.Now, the L-shape's vertices are:(0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2).These must lie on the rectangle's edges.So, (0,0) must be on the bottom edge, which is from (a,0) to (b,0). Similarly, (4,0) must be on the bottom edge, so (4,0) is on the bottom edge, which is from (a,0) to (b,0). Therefore, a ≤ 0 ≤ 4 ≤ b, so a ≤ 0 and b ≥ 4.Similarly, (0,2) is on the left edge, which is from (a,0) to (a,H) = (a,2). So, (0,2) is on the left edge, so a = 0, because the left edge is at x=a, and (0,2) is on it, so a=0.Similarly, (4,2) is on the right edge, which is from (b,0) to (b,2). So, (4,2) is on the right edge, so b=4.But earlier, we had a + b = 4, with a=0 and b=4, which satisfies 0 + 4 = 4.So, the rectangle is from x=0 to x=4, and y=0 to y=2, so width=4, height=2, area=8. But again, that's too small, and the L-shape's vertex at (2,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge, which is correct, but the area is 8, not among the options.Wait, but the problem says the L-shape is placed inside a rectangle, so maybe the rectangle is larger, and the L-shape is placed such that one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's edge, but not necessarily the top edge.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is taller. Let me consider that.Suppose the rectangle has height H > 2, and width W. Let me assume that (2,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge, so the top edge is from (0, H) to (4, H), midpoint at (2, H). So, (2, H) = (2,2), so H=2. So, that brings us back to the previous case.Alternatively, maybe (2,2) is at the midpoint of the right edge. So, the right edge is from (W,0) to (W, H), midpoint at (W, H/2). So, (W, H/2) = (2,2). Therefore, W=2 and H/2=2, so H=4.So, the rectangle is from x=0 to x=2, and y=0 to y=4. Now, let's see if all five vertices of the L-shape lie on this rectangle.The L-shape's vertices are (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2).But in this rectangle, x ranges from 0 to 2, so (4,0) and (4,2) are outside the rectangle. So, that's not possible.Alternatively, maybe (4,2) is at the midpoint of the right edge. So, the right edge is from (W,0) to (W, H), midpoint at (W, H/2). So, (W, H/2) = (4,2). Therefore, W=4 and H=4.So, the rectangle is from x=0 to x=4, y=0 to y=4. Now, let's check if all five vertices lie on this rectangle.(0,0): bottom-left corner.(4,0): on the bottom edge at (4,0).(4,2): on the right edge at (4,2), which is the midpoint of the right edge.(2,2): on the top edge? Wait, the top edge is from (0,4) to (4,4). So, (2,2) is not on the top edge. It's inside the rectangle.So, (2,2) is inside the rectangle, not on the edge. Therefore, this configuration doesn't satisfy the condition that all five vertices lie on the rectangle.Hmm, this is tricky.Wait, maybe the rectangle is such that one of the L-shape's vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's top edge, and another at the midpoint of the right edge, but that might complicate things.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is 6 units wide and 4 units tall, area 24.Wait, let me think about the L-shape's diagonal. The diagonal of the L-shape from (0,0) to (4,2) has length sqrt((4)^2 + (2)^2) = sqrt(16 + 4) = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5). Maybe the rectangle's diagonal is related to this.But I'm not sure if that's helpful.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is such that the L-shape is placed with one vertex at the midpoint of the rectangle's top edge and another at the midpoint of the right edge.Wait, let me try assigning coordinates again.Suppose the rectangle has width W and height H.Let me assume that (2,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge, so top edge is from (a, H) to (b, H), midpoint at ((a+b)/2, H) = (2,2). So, (a + b)/2 = 2 => a + b = 4, and H=2.Also, (4,2) is on the right edge, which is from (W,0) to (W, H). So, (4,2) is on the right edge, so W=4 and H=2. So, the rectangle is from x=0 to x=4, y=0 to y=2, area 8, which is too small.Alternatively, maybe (4,2) is at the midpoint of the right edge. So, right edge is from (W,0) to (W, H), midpoint at (W, H/2) = (4,2). So, W=4, H=4.Then, the rectangle is from x=0 to x=4, y=0 to y=4. Now, check if all five vertices lie on the rectangle.(0,0): bottom-left corner.(4,0): on the bottom edge.(4,2): on the right edge at midpoint.(2,2): inside the rectangle, not on the edge.(0,2): on the left edge.So, (2,2) is inside, which is a problem.Alternatively, maybe (0,2) is at the midpoint of the left edge. So, left edge is from (0,0) to (0, H), midpoint at (0, H/2) = (0,2). So, H/2=2 => H=4.So, the rectangle is from y=0 to y=4. Now, the L-shape's vertices:(0,0): bottom-left corner.(4,0): on the bottom edge.(4,2): on the right edge? If the right edge is at x=W, then (4,2) is on the right edge if W=4.(2,2): on the top edge? The top edge is from (0,4) to (4,4). So, (2,2) is not on the top edge.(0,2): on the left edge at midpoint.So, again, (2,2) is inside the rectangle, not on the edge.Hmm, this is frustrating.Wait, maybe the rectangle is such that the L-shape is placed diagonally inside it, with one vertex at the midpoint of the rectangle's top edge and another at the midpoint of the right edge, but that might require a different configuration.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is 5 units by 4 units, area 20.Wait, let me think about the possible dimensions.If the rectangle is 6 units wide and 4 units tall, area 24, which is an option.But how would the L-shape fit inside?Wait, perhaps the L-shape is placed such that one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's longer side.Suppose the rectangle is 6 units wide and 4 units tall. The midpoint of the top edge is at (3,4). If one of the L-shape's vertices is at (3,4), but the L-shape's vertices are at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2). So, (3,4) is not one of them.Alternatively, maybe the midpoint of the right edge is at (6,2). If (4,2) is at (6,2), then the rectangle's right edge is at x=6, so W=6, and H=4.Then, the rectangle is from x=0 to x=6, y=0 to y=4.Now, check if all five vertices lie on the rectangle.(0,0): bottom-left corner.(4,0): on the bottom edge.(4,2): on the right edge at (4,2). Wait, the right edge is at x=6, so (4,2) is inside the rectangle, not on the edge.So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe the midpoint of the right edge is at (6,2), and one of the L-shape's vertices is at (6,2). But the L-shape's vertices are at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2). So, (4,2) is at (4,2), which is not the midpoint of the right edge.Wait, maybe the rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, area 20.So, W=5, H=4.Midpoint of the top edge is at (2.5,4). If one of the L-shape's vertices is at (2.5,4), but the L-shape's vertices are at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2). So, none of them are at (2.5,4).Alternatively, midpoint of the right edge is at (5,2). If (4,2) is at (5,2), then the rectangle's right edge is at x=5, so W=5, and H=4.Then, the rectangle is from x=0 to x=5, y=0 to y=4.Now, check if all five vertices lie on the rectangle.(0,0): bottom-left corner.(4,0): on the bottom edge.(4,2): on the right edge at (4,2). Wait, the right edge is at x=5, so (4,2) is inside the rectangle, not on the edge.So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is 6 units wide and 4 units tall, area 24.Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the L-shape is placed such that one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's top edge, and another at the midpoint of the right edge, but that would require two midpoints, which might not be possible.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, area 20.Wait, let me try to think about the coordinates again.Suppose the rectangle is from x=0 to x=5, y=0 to y=4.Then, the midpoints are at (2.5,0), (2.5,4), (0,2), (5,2).If one of the L-shape's vertices is at (2.5,4), but the L-shape's vertices are at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2). So, none of them are at (2.5,4).Alternatively, if one of the vertices is at (5,2), which is the midpoint of the right edge. So, (5,2) is one of the L-shape's vertices. But the L-shape's vertices are at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2). So, (4,2) is at (4,2), which is not (5,2).Wait, unless the L-shape is scaled or shifted.Wait, but the L-shape is made of three squares, each of side length 2, so it can't be scaled.Wait, maybe the rectangle is 6 units wide and 4 units tall, area 24.Then, the midpoints are at (3,0), (3,4), (0,2), (6,2).If one of the L-shape's vertices is at (6,2), but the L-shape's vertices are at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2). So, (4,2) is at (4,2), which is not (6,2).Alternatively, maybe the L-shape is placed such that (4,2) is at (6,2), meaning the rectangle is shifted.Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should consider that the rectangle is 6 units wide and 4 units tall, area 24, and the L-shape is placed such that one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the rectangle's right edge, which is at (6,2). So, the L-shape's vertex at (4,2) is at (6,2), meaning the L-shape is shifted 2 units to the right. But then, the other vertices would be at (2,0), (6,0), (6,2), (4,2), (2,2). But the original L-shape is at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2). So, shifting it 2 units to the right would make it fit into the rectangle from x=2 to x=6, but then the rectangle would have to be from x=0 to x=6, y=0 to y=4, but the L-shape's vertices would be at (2,0), (6,0), (6,2), (4,2), (2,2). So, (2,0) is on the bottom edge, (6,0) is on the bottom edge, (6,2) is on the right edge, (4,2) is on the right edge, and (2,2) is on the top edge? Wait, the top edge is at y=4, so (2,2) is not on the top edge.This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.Wait, perhaps the rectangle is such that the L-shape is placed with one vertex at the midpoint of the rectangle's longer side, and the rectangle's dimensions are such that the L-shape fits with all vertices on the rectangle.Let me consider that the rectangle has width W and height H, and one of the L-shape's vertices is at the midpoint of one of its edges.Let me assume that the midpoint is on the top edge, so (W/2, H). If one of the L-shape's vertices is at (W/2, H), then that vertex must be one of (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), (2,2), (0,2). So, (W/2, H) must be one of these points.Case 1: (W/2, H) = (0,0). Then, W/2=0 => W=0, which is impossible.Case 2: (W/2, H) = (4,0). Then, W/2=4 => W=8, and H=0, which is impossible.Case 3: (W/2, H) = (4,2). Then, W/2=4 => W=8, and H=2.So, the rectangle is 8 units wide and 2 units tall. Now, check if all five vertices lie on the rectangle.(0,0): on the bottom edge.(4,0): on the bottom edge.(4,2): on the top edge at midpoint.(2,2): on the top edge.(0,2): on the left edge.So, all five vertices lie on the rectangle, with (4,2) at the midpoint of the top edge. The area is 8*2=16, which is option A.But earlier, I thought this might be too small, but maybe it's correct.Alternatively, let's check another case.Case 4: (W/2, H) = (2,2). Then, W/2=2 => W=4, and H=2.So, the rectangle is 4x2, area 8, but as before, this is too small because the L-shape's vertex at (4,0) is on the bottom edge, but (4,0) is at the midpoint if W=4, but the midpoint is at (2,0). So, (4,0) is at the endpoint, not the midpoint.But the problem states that one of the vertices is at the midpoint, so this is acceptable because only one vertex needs to be at the midpoint.Wait, but in this case, the rectangle is 4x2, area 8, but the L-shape's vertex at (4,0) is on the bottom edge at (4,0), which is the midpoint if W=4, but the midpoint is at (2,0). So, (4,0) is not the midpoint, but it's on the edge. So, this configuration doesn't satisfy the condition that one vertex is at the midpoint.Therefore, the only valid case is when (W/2, H) = (4,2), leading to W=8 and H=2, area 16.But wait, earlier I thought that the rectangle is 8x2, but in that case, the L-shape's vertex at (0,2) is on the left edge at (0,2), which is the midpoint of the left edge if H=2, but the midpoint is at (0,1). So, (0,2) is at the top of the left edge, which is a corner, not the midpoint.But the problem states that one of the vertices is at the midpoint of an edge, not necessarily which one. So, in this case, (4,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge, which satisfies the condition. The other vertices are on the edges, but not necessarily at midpoints.Therefore, the area is 16, option A.But wait, the options include 16, but I'm not sure if this is correct because the L-shape is 4x2, and the rectangle is 8x2, which seems to have the L-shape only occupying half the width. Maybe I'm missing something.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is 6 units wide and 4 units tall, area 24, which is option E.Wait, let me think again. If the rectangle is 6 units wide and 4 units tall, the midpoints are at (3,0), (3,4), (0,2), (6,2).If one of the L-shape's vertices is at (6,2), which is the midpoint of the right edge, then the L-shape's vertex at (4,2) would be at (6,2), meaning the L-shape is shifted 2 units to the right. But then, the other vertices would be at (2,0), (6,0), (6,2), (4,2), (2,2). So, the rectangle would have to be from x=2 to x=6, y=0 to y=4, but then the L-shape's vertex at (2,0) is on the left edge, (6,0) is on the bottom edge, (6,2) is on the right edge, (4,2) is on the right edge, and (2,2) is on the top edge. Wait, the top edge is at y=4, so (2,2) is not on the top edge.This seems inconsistent.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, area 20.Midpoints at (2.5,0), (2.5,4), (0,2), (5,2).If one of the L-shape's vertices is at (5,2), which is the midpoint of the right edge, then the L-shape's vertex at (4,2) is at (5,2), meaning the L-shape is shifted 1 unit to the right. Then, the other vertices would be at (3,0), (7,0), (7,2), (5,2), (3,2). But the rectangle is from x=3 to x=7, y=0 to y=4, but the L-shape's vertices are at (3,0), (7,0), (7,2), (5,2), (3,2). So, (3,0) is on the left edge, (7,0) is on the bottom edge, (7,2) is on the right edge, (5,2) is on the right edge, and (3,2) is on the top edge? The top edge is at y=4, so (3,2) is not on the top edge.This is not working.Wait, maybe the rectangle is 6 units wide and 4 units tall, area 24, and the L-shape is placed such that (4,2) is at the midpoint of the right edge, which is at (6,2). So, the L-shape is shifted 2 units to the right. Then, the L-shape's vertices would be at (2,0), (6,0), (6,2), (4,2), (2,2). Now, the rectangle is from x=2 to x=6, y=0 to y=4. So, (2,0) is on the left edge, (6,0) is on the bottom edge, (6,2) is on the right edge, (4,2) is on the right edge, and (2,2) is on the top edge? The top edge is at y=4, so (2,2) is not on the top edge.This is not working either.Wait, maybe the rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, area 20, and the L-shape is placed such that (2,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge, which is at (2.5,4). But (2,2) is not at (2.5,4), so that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, and the L-shape is placed such that (4,2) is at the midpoint of the right edge, which is at (5,2). So, the L-shape's vertex at (4,2) is at (5,2), meaning the L-shape is shifted 1 unit to the right. Then, the other vertices would be at (3,0), (7,0), (7,2), (5,2), (3,2). But the rectangle is from x=3 to x=7, y=0 to y=4, which is 4 units wide, but the L-shape is 4 units wide, so this might fit.Wait, but the rectangle is 5 units wide, so from x=3 to x=8, which is 5 units. Then, the L-shape's vertices would be at (3,0), (7,0), (7,2), (5,2), (3,2). Now, (3,0) is on the left edge, (7,0) is on the bottom edge, (7,2) is on the right edge, (5,2) is on the right edge, and (3,2) is on the top edge? The top edge is at y=4, so (3,2) is not on the top edge.This is not working.I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the initial assumption.If the rectangle is 8 units wide and 2 units tall, area 16, with the L-shape placed such that (4,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge, then all five vertices lie on the rectangle, with one at the midpoint. This seems to satisfy the conditions, even though the rectangle is quite wide.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is 6 units wide and 4 units tall, area 24, and the L-shape is placed such that (2,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge, which is at (3,4). But (2,2) is not at (3,4), so that doesn't work.Wait, perhaps the rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, area 20, and the L-shape is placed such that (2,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge, which is at (2.5,4). But (2,2) is not at (2.5,4), so that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, and the L-shape is placed such that (4,2) is at the midpoint of the right edge, which is at (5,2). So, the L-shape's vertex at (4,2) is at (5,2), meaning the L-shape is shifted 1 unit to the right. Then, the other vertices would be at (3,0), (7,0), (7,2), (5,2), (3,2). Now, the rectangle is from x=3 to x=7, y=0 to y=4, which is 4 units wide, but the L-shape is 4 units wide, so this might fit. However, (3,2) is not on the top edge, which is at y=4.This is not working.Wait, maybe the rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, and the L-shape is placed such that (0,2) is at the midpoint of the left edge, which is at (0,2). So, the left edge is from (0,0) to (0,4), midpoint at (0,2). So, (0,2) is at the midpoint of the left edge. Then, the rectangle is from x=0 to x=5, y=0 to y=4.Now, check if all five vertices lie on the rectangle.(0,0): bottom-left corner.(4,0): on the bottom edge.(4,2): on the right edge? The right edge is at x=5, so (4,2) is inside the rectangle.(2,2): inside the rectangle.(0,2): midpoint of the left edge.So, (4,2) and (2,2) are inside the rectangle, not on the edges. Therefore, this configuration doesn't satisfy the condition.Wait, maybe the rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, and the L-shape is placed such that (4,2) is at the midpoint of the right edge, which is at (5,2). So, the L-shape's vertex at (4,2) is at (5,2), meaning the L-shape is shifted 1 unit to the right. Then, the other vertices would be at (3,0), (7,0), (7,2), (5,2), (3,2). Now, the rectangle is from x=3 to x=7, y=0 to y=4, which is 4 units wide, but the L-shape is 4 units wide, so this might fit. However, (3,2) is not on the top edge, which is at y=4.This is not working.I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the only configuration that works is the rectangle being 8 units wide and 2 units tall, area 16, with the L-shape placed such that (4,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge. Therefore, the area is 16, option A.But wait, the problem says \\"the L-shape is placed inside a rectangle so that all five vertices of the L-shape lie on the rectangle, one of them at the midpoint of an edge.\\" So, in this case, all five vertices are on the rectangle, with one at the midpoint. So, I think 16 is the correct answer.But wait, I'm not sure because the L-shape is 4 units wide and 2 units tall, and the rectangle is 8 units wide and 2 units tall, which seems to have the L-shape only occupying half the width. Maybe the rectangle is supposed to be the minimal rectangle that can contain the L-shape with one vertex at the midpoint.Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is 6 units wide and 4 units tall, area 24, and the L-shape is placed such that (2,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge, which is at (3,4). But (2,2) is not at (3,4), so that doesn't work.Wait, maybe the rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, area 20, and the L-shape is placed such that (2,2) is at the midpoint of the top edge, which is at (2.5,4). But (2,2) is not at (2.5,4), so that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, and the L-shape is placed such that (4,2) is at the midpoint of the right edge, which is at (5,2).

Now, the rectangle is from x=3 to x=7, y=0 to y=4, which is 4 units wide, but the L-shape is 4 units wide, so this might fit. However, (3,2) is not on the top edge, which is at y=4.This is not working.I think I've tried all possible configurations, and the only one that works is the rectangle being 8 units wide and 2 units tall, area 16. Therefore, the answer is 16, option A."},{"question":"A talented concert pianist is tuning her piano and finds that the harmony between two strings can be modeled by the polynomial equation ( H(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ), where ( x ) represents the frequency in hertz. To achieve perfect harmony, the frequencies need to be the roots of this polynomial.1. Find the frequencies at which perfect harmony is achieved by solving the polynomial equation ( H(x) = 0 ).2. Once the pianist has found these frequencies, she wants to ensure that the difference between any two frequencies does not exceed 2 hertz to maintain a perfect blend. Verify whether all pairwise differences between the frequencies satisfy this condition.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a concert pianist tuning her piano. The harmony between two strings is modeled by the polynomial equation ( H(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ). The roots of this polynomial represent the frequencies in hertz where perfect harmony is achieved. First, I need to find these frequencies by solving ( H(x) = 0 ). Okay, so I have a cubic equation here. I remember that solving cubic equations can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can factor this one. Let me see if I can find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction ( frac{p}{q} ), has a numerator ( p ) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator ( q ) that is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -6, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are just the factors of -6, which are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.Let me test these possible roots one by one by plugging them into the polynomial.Starting with ( x = 1 ):( H(1) = 1^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0 ).Oh, that works! So, ( x = 1 ) is a root. That means ( (x - 1) ) is a factor of the polynomial.Now, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out ( (x - 1) ) from ( H(x) ). Let me try synthetic division because it's usually quicker.Setting up synthetic division with root 1:1 | 1  -6  11  -6        1  -5   6      1  -5   6   0So, the polynomial can be factored as ( (x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6) ). Now, I can factor the quadratic ( x^2 - 5x + 6 ) further.Looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. Hmm, -2 and -3. So, it factors into ( (x - 2)(x - 3) ).Putting it all together, the polynomial factors as ( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) ). Therefore, the roots are ( x = 1 ), ( x = 2 ), and ( x = 3 ). So, the frequencies at which perfect harmony is achieved are 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 3 Hz. Wait a second, that seems a bit low for piano frequencies. I mean, pianos usually have frequencies in the range of tens to hundreds of hertz. Maybe the model is simplified or uses normalized frequencies? I guess for the sake of the problem, we'll go with these values.Moving on to the second part. The pianist wants to ensure that the difference between any two frequencies does not exceed 2 Hz to maintain a perfect blend. I need to verify whether all pairwise differences satisfy this condition.Let me list the frequencies again: 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 3 Hz.Calculating the differences between each pair:1. Between 1 Hz and 2 Hz: ( 2 - 1 = 1 ) Hz.2. Between 1 Hz and 3 Hz: ( 3 - 1 = 2 ) Hz.3. Between 2 Hz and 3 Hz: ( 3 - 2 = 1 ) Hz.So, the differences are 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 1 Hz. All of these differences are 2 Hz or less. Therefore, the condition is satisfied.Wait, but just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me double-check the calculations.1. 2 - 1 is indeed 1.2. 3 - 1 is 2.3. 3 - 2 is 1.Yep, all differences are within the 2 Hz limit. So, the pianist can be assured that the harmony is perfect with these frequencies.But hold on, I'm a bit confused because in music, harmony usually refers to the combination of multiple frequencies, like octaves or intervals. The differences here are 1 Hz and 2 Hz, which are quite small. In reality, musical intervals are based on ratios of frequencies, not differences. For example, an octave is a ratio of 2:1, not a difference of 1 Hz. But maybe in this problem, it's simplified to use differences instead of ratios. Since the problem specifically mentions differences, I should stick to that. So, as per the given condition, all pairwise differences are within 2 Hz, so it's okay.I think that's all. I solved the equation, found the roots, checked the differences, and everything seems to fit the requirements.**Final Answer**The frequencies are boxed{1}, boxed{2}, and boxed{3} hertz, and all pairwise differences do not exceed 2 hertz.**Final Answer**The frequencies are boxed{1}, boxed{2}, and boxed{3} hertz, and all pairwise differences do not exceed 2 hertz."},{"question":"As a Latino community organizer in Allentown, Pennsylvania, you are planning a cultural festival to celebrate and bring together the vibrant community.

There's a flat fee for the venue, a cost per attendee, and a fixed charge for the performers.The venue charges a flat fee of 1,000 and an additional 15 for each attendee.

Let me try to understand it step by step. The sequence is denoted as {a_n}, and the sum of its terms is S_n. The first term, a_1, is given as 1. The common ratio is a - 3/2, and the limit of S_n as n approaches infinity is equal to a. I need to find the value of a.Hmm, okay. So, let's recall what I know about geometric sequences. A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, which is usually denoted as r. In this case, the common ratio is given as a - 3/2. So, r = a - 3/2.Now, the sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula S = a_1 / (1 - r), provided that |r| < 1. This is because if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1, the terms get smaller and smaller, approaching zero, and the series converges to a finite sum. If |r| is greater than or equal to 1, the series doesn't converge, and the sum would be infinite or undefined.In this problem, the sum S_n approaches a as n approaches infinity. So, that means the sum S is equal to a. Therefore, according to the formula, a = a_1 / (1 - r). Since a_1 is given as 1, this simplifies to a = 1 / (1 - r).But wait, r is given as a - 3/2. So, substituting that into the equation, we get a = 1 / (1 - (a - 3/2)). Let me write that down:a = 1 / (1 - (a - 3/2))Simplify the denominator:1 - (a - 3/2) = 1 - a + 3/2Combine like terms:1 + 3/2 = 5/2, so the denominator becomes (5/2 - a)So, now the equation is:a = 1 / (5/2 - a)Hmm, okay. So, I have an equation where a is equal to 1 divided by (5/2 - a). Let me write that as:a = 1 / (5/2 - a)To solve for a, I can cross-multiply. That is, multiply both sides by (5/2 - a):a * (5/2 - a) = 1Let me expand the left side:(5/2)a - a^2 = 1So, that gives me a quadratic equation:- a^2 + (5/2)a - 1 = 0I can rewrite this to make it a bit more standard:a^2 - (5/2)a + 1 = 0Wait, actually, if I multiply both sides by -1, it becomes:a^2 - (5/2)a + 1 = 0Alternatively, to eliminate the fraction, I can multiply every term by 2:2a^2 - 5a + 2 = 0Now, I have a quadratic equation: 2a^2 - 5a + 2 = 0Let me try to factor this quadratic. The quadratic is 2a^2 -5a +2.Looking for two numbers that multiply to (2*2)=4 and add up to -5. Hmm, wait, actually, the standard factoring method for quadratics is to find two numbers that multiply to (a*c) and add up to b.In this case, a=2, b=-5, c=2.So, a*c = 2*2 = 4.Looking for two numbers that multiply to 4 and add up to -5.Hmm, factors of 4 are 1 and 4, 2 and 2.But 1 and 4: 1 + 4 = 5, but we need -5. So, maybe -1 and -4? -1 + (-4) = -5.Yes, that works.So, we can write the quadratic as:2a^2 -4a -a +2 =0Grouping the terms:(2a^2 -4a) + (-a +2) =0Factor out 2a from the first group and -1 from the second group:2a(a - 2) -1(a - 2) =0Now, factor out the common term (a - 2):(2a -1)(a - 2) =0So, the solutions are:2a -1 =0 => 2a=1 => a=1/2ora -2=0 => a=2So, the solutions are a=1/2 and a=2.But wait, I need to remember that for the sum of an infinite geometric series to converge, the absolute value of the common ratio must be less than 1. So, |r| < 1.Given that r = a - 3/2, let's compute |a - 3/2| <1 for each solution.First, for a=1/2:r = 1/2 - 3/2 = (1 -3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1So, |r| = |-1| =1But the condition is |r| <1, not less than or equal to. So, |r|=1 does not satisfy the convergence condition. Therefore, a=1/2 is not a valid solution because the series would not converge.Now, check a=2:r =2 - 3/2 = (4/2 -3/2)=1/2So, |r|=|1/2|=1/2 <1That satisfies the convergence condition. Therefore, a=2 is the valid solution.So, the value of a is 2.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I started with the sum formula: S = a_1 / (1 - r), which is correct for |r| <1.2. Substituted a_1=1 and S=a, so a=1/(1 - r). Correct.3. Substituted r = a - 3/2 into the equation: a=1/(1 - (a - 3/2)).4. Simplified denominator: 1 - a + 3/2 = 5/2 -a. Correct.5. So, equation becomes a=1/(5/2 -a). Then cross-multiplied: a*(5/2 -a)=1.6. Expanded: (5/2)a -a^2=1. Then rearranged to quadratic: a^2 - (5/2)a +1=0.7. Multiplied by 2 to eliminate fractions: 2a^2 -5a +2=0.8. Factored quadratic: (2a -1)(a -2)=0, so a=1/2 or a=2.9. Checked convergence condition |r| <1:- For a=1/2, r=-1, |r|=1, which is not less than 1. So, invalid.- For a=2, r=1/2, |r|=1/2 <1. So, valid.Therefore, a=2 is the correct answer.I think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"A, B, and C are guessing a two-digit number.A says: Its number of factors is even, and it is greater than 50.B says: It is an odd number, and it is greater than 60.C says: It is an even number, and it is greater than 70.If each of them only spoke half the truth, what is this number?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem where A, B, and C are each guessing a two-digit number. Each of them makes two statements, but only half of what they say is true. That means for each person, one statement is true, and the other is false. My goal is to figure out what the actual number is based on their statements.Let me break down what each person says:- **A** says: \\"Its number of factors is even, and it is greater than 50.\\"- **B** says: \\"It is an odd number, and it is greater than 60.\\"- **C** says: \\"It is an even number, and it is greater than 70.\\"So, each of them has two claims, and only one of those claims is true. That means for each person, one part is correct, and the other is incorrect. Let's tackle each person one by one and see what constraints we can get.Starting with **A**:1. **Number of factors is even**: The number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. If a number has a prime factorization of ( n = p_1^{a_1} times p_2^{a_2} times dots times p_k^{a_k} ), then the number of factors is ( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)dots(a_k + 1) ). For this product to be even, at least one of the exponents ( a_i ) must be odd because adding 1 to an odd exponent gives an even number, making the entire product even. So, numbers with an even number of factors are either squares (since their exponents are even, but wait, actually squares have exponents that are odd when incremented, making the number of factors odd. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.Wait, actually, the number of factors is even for all numbers except perfect squares. Because for non-square numbers, factors come in pairs, so the count is even. For perfect squares, one of the factors is repeated, so the count is odd. So, if A says the number of factors is even, that would mean the number is not a perfect square. So, if A's first statement is true, the number isn't a square. If it's false, then it is a square.2. **It is greater than 50**: So, if this is true, the number is 51 or higher. If it's false, it's 50 or lower.Since A is telling half the truth, either the number isn't a square and is greater than 50, or it is a square and not greater than 50.Moving on to **B**:1. **It is an odd number**: So, if this is true, the number is odd. If false, it's even.2. **It is greater than 60**: If true, the number is 61 or higher. If false, it's 60 or lower.Again, since B is half-true, either it's odd and greater than 60, or it's even and not greater than 60.Now, **C**:1. **It is an even number**: If true, the number is even. If false, it's odd.2. **It is greater than 70**: If true, the number is 71 or higher. If false, it's 70 or lower.So, C is either even and greater than 70, or odd and not greater than 70.Alright, let's try to combine these constraints.First, let's note that A, B, and C each have one true and one false statement. So, let's consider the possibilities for each.Starting with A:Case 1: A's first statement is true (number of factors is even, so not a square) and second is false (number is ≤50). So, the number is a non-square ≤50.Case 2: A's first statement is false (number is a square) and second is true (number >50). So, the number is a square >50.Similarly, for B:Case 1: B's first statement is true (odd) and second is false (≤60). So, odd and ≤60.Case 2: B's first statement is false (even) and second is true (>60). So, even and >60.For C:Case 1: C's first statement is true (even) and second is false (≤70). So, even and ≤70.Case 2: C's first statement is false (odd) and second is true (>70). So, odd and >70.Now, let's see how these cases can overlap.First, let's consider A's two cases.Case 1 for A: non-square ≤50.But let's look at B and C. If the number is ≤50, then B's second statement (>60) is false, so B's first statement must be true (odd). So, number is odd and ≤50.Similarly, for C, if the number is ≤50, then C's second statement (>70) is false, so C's first statement must be true (even). But wait, if the number is ≤50 and odd (from B), then C's first statement (even) is false, so C's second statement must be true, which would mean the number >70. But that's a contradiction because we assumed the number is ≤50. So, this case leads to a contradiction. Therefore, A's Case 1 is invalid.Therefore, A must be in Case 2: number is a square >50.So, the number is a square number greater than 50. The two-digit squares greater than 50 are 64 (8²), 81 (9²), and 100 (10², but that's three digits, so we can ignore it). So, possible numbers are 64 and 81.Now, let's check B and C with these possibilities.First, let's consider the number being 64.Check B's statements:1. It is an odd number: 64 is even, so this is false.2. It is greater than 60: 64 >60, so this is true.So, for B, one statement is true, one is false. That works.Now, check C's statements:1. It is an even number: 64 is even, so true.2. It is greater than 70: 64 is not, so false.So, for C, one statement is true, one is false. That also works.Now, let's check A's statements:1. Number of factors is even: 64 is 2^6, so number of factors is 6+1=7, which is odd. So, A's first statement is false.2. It is greater than 50: 64 >50, so true.So, A has one true, one false. Perfect.So, 64 seems to satisfy all conditions.But let's check the other possibility, which is 81.Check B's statements:1. It is an odd number: 81 is odd, so true.2. It is greater than 60: 81>60, so true.Uh-oh, both statements are true. But B is only supposed to have half the truth, so this is invalid. Therefore, 81 can't be the number.So, 64 is the only candidate left.Wait, but let me double-check. Is 64 a square? Yes, 8²=64. So, A's first statement is false (since it's a square, number of factors is odd). A's second statement is true (64>50). So, A is half-true.B says it's odd and >60. 64 is even, so first statement is false, second is true. So, B is half-true.C says it's even and >70. 64 is even, so first statement is true, second is false. So, C is half-true.Yes, that all checks out.Wait, but let me make sure there are no other squares between 50 and 100. 64, 81, 100. 100 is three digits, so only 64 and 81. We saw 81 doesn't work because B would have both statements true, so 64 is the only one.Therefore, the number must be 64.But wait, let me think again. Is 64 the only possible number? Let me see.Wait, could there be a non-square number that also satisfies the conditions? But from A's case, we saw that if A's first statement is false, the number is a square >50. So, only squares >50 are considered, which are 64 and 81. Since 81 doesn't work, 64 is the only one.Alternatively, if I had considered A's first statement as true, meaning number of factors is even (so not a square) and number >50. But we saw that leads to a contradiction because C's statements would conflict. So, that path is invalid.Therefore, the only possible number is 64.Wait, but let me check the number of factors for 64. 64 is 2^6, so number of factors is 7, which is odd. So, A's first statement is false, which is correct.Yes, everything seems consistent.So, the number is 64."},{"question":"Let  a, b, c  be positive integers such that  a + 2b +3c = 100 .Find the greatest value of  M = abc ","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest value of M = abc, where a, b, c are positive integers satisfying the equation a + 2b + 3c = 100. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that a, b, and c are positive integers, so they have to be at least 1. The equation given is a linear combination of a, b, and c, and I need to maximize the product abc. This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use some algebraic methods or perhaps even calculus, but since a, b, c are integers, calculus might not be directly applicable. Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers? Wait, but that's for continuous variables. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others and then try to find the maximum. Let me try that.Let me solve the equation for a: a = 100 - 2b - 3c. Since a has to be positive, 100 - 2b - 3c > 0, so 2b + 3c < 100. That gives me a constraint on b and c.So, M = abc = (100 - 2b - 3c) * b * c. So, M is a function of b and c. Maybe I can treat this as a function of two variables and try to find its maximum.But since b and c are integers, it's a bit tricky. Maybe I can fix one variable and then find the optimal value of the other. Let's say I fix c, then express M in terms of b, and find the maximum for each c.So, M = (100 - 2b - 3c) * b * c. Let's fix c, then M becomes a quadratic in b: M = (100 - 3c) * b - 2b². So, for each fixed c, M is a quadratic function in b, which opens downward (since the coefficient of b² is negative). Therefore, the maximum occurs at the vertex of the parabola.The vertex occurs at b = -B/(2A) where the quadratic is in the form Ab² + Bb + C. In this case, A = -2, B = (100 - 3c). So, b = (100 - 3c)/(4). Since b must be an integer, the optimal b for each c is around (100 - 3c)/4.But since b must be an integer, I can take the floor or ceiling of that value and check which gives a higher M.Similarly, maybe I can fix b and express M in terms of c, but I think fixing c and finding b might be more straightforward.Alternatively, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality? Let me recall that for positive numbers, the product is maximized when the numbers are as equal as possible. But in this case, the coefficients are different, so it's not straightforward.Wait, the equation is a + 2b + 3c = 100. Maybe I can think of this as a weighted sum. So, if I consider the weights 1, 2, 3, then the variables a, b, c are multiplied by these weights. So, perhaps to maximize abc, the variables should be as equal as possible in terms of their contributions.Let me try to think in terms of equalizing the terms. Suppose I let a = 2b = 3c. Then, a = 2b = 3c = k, so a = k, b = k/2, c = k/3. But since a, b, c must be integers, k must be a multiple of 6. Let me see if this works.If a = 2b = 3c = k, then k must be a multiple of 6. Let me set k = 6m, so a = 6m, b = 3m, c = 2m. Then, plugging into the equation: a + 2b + 3c = 6m + 6m + 6m = 18m. But 18m = 100? Hmm, 100 isn't a multiple of 18, so this approach might not directly work. Maybe I can adjust m to get close to 100.Wait, 18m = 100 implies m ≈ 5.555. So, m can be 5 or 6. Let's try m = 5: a = 30, b = 15, c = 10. Then, a + 2b + 3c = 30 + 30 + 30 = 90, which is less than 100. For m = 6: a = 36, b = 18, c = 12. Then, a + 2b + 3c = 36 + 36 + 36 = 108, which is more than 100. So, neither m=5 nor m=6 gives exactly 100. Maybe this approach isn't the best.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the ratios. Since the coefficients are 1, 2, 3, perhaps the variables a, b, c should be in the ratio 1:2:3. Wait, no, that might not necessarily be the case because the product abc is being maximized. Maybe the variables should be in a certain ratio to maximize the product.Wait, in the case of the standard AM-GM inequality, for variables without coefficients, the maximum product occurs when all variables are equal. But here, since each variable is multiplied by a different coefficient, maybe the variables should be adjusted accordingly.Let me think of the equation a + 2b + 3c = 100 as a resource allocation problem, where each variable consumes a different amount of the resource. To maximize the product, we might want to allocate the resource such that the marginal contributions are balanced.Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution. Let me express a as 100 - 2b - 3c, as before, and then write M = (100 - 2b - 3c) * b * c. Then, I can consider M as a function of two variables, b and c, and try to find its maximum.To find the maximum, I can take partial derivatives with respect to b and c, set them to zero, and solve for b and c. But since b and c must be integers, I can use this to approximate the optimal values and then check nearby integers.Let me compute the partial derivatives.Let me denote M = (100 - 2b - 3c) * b * c.First, compute ∂M/∂b:∂M/∂b = (100 - 2b - 3c) * c + b * c * (-2) = c(100 - 2b - 3c) - 2bc = 100c - 2b c - 3c² - 2b c = 100c - 4b c - 3c².Similarly, compute ∂M/∂c:∂M/∂c = (100 - 2b - 3c) * b + b * c * (-3) = b(100 - 2b - 3c) - 3b c = 100b - 2b² - 3b c - 3b c = 100b - 2b² - 6b c.To find critical points, set both partial derivatives equal to zero.So,1) 100c - 4b c - 3c² = 02) 100b - 2b² - 6b c = 0Let me factor these equations.From equation 1:c(100 - 4b - 3c) = 0Since c > 0, we have 100 - 4b - 3c = 0 => 4b + 3c = 100.From equation 2:b(100 - 2b - 6c) = 0Since b > 0, we have 100 - 2b - 6c = 0 => 2b + 6c = 100 => b + 3c = 50.So now, we have two equations:4b + 3c = 100andb + 3c = 50Let me subtract the second equation from the first:(4b + 3c) - (b + 3c) = 100 - 50 => 3b = 50 => b = 50/3 ≈ 16.666...Hmm, but b must be an integer, so 16.666 is not an integer. So, perhaps the maximum occurs around b = 16 or 17.Let me check.From the second equation, b + 3c = 50 => b = 50 - 3c.Plugging into the first equation: 4b + 3c = 100 => 4*(50 - 3c) + 3c = 100 => 200 - 12c + 3c = 100 => 200 - 9c = 100 => 9c = 100 => c = 100/9 ≈ 11.111...Again, c must be an integer, so c ≈ 11.So, c = 11, then b = 50 - 3*11 = 50 - 33 = 17.So, b =17, c=11.Then, a = 100 - 2b - 3c = 100 - 34 - 33 = 33.So, a=33, b=17, c=11.Let me compute M = 33*17*11.33*17 = 561, 561*11 = 6171.Hmm, is this the maximum? Let me check nearby integers.Since b was approximately 16.666, let's try b=16 and b=17.For b=16:From equation b + 3c =50 => 16 + 3c =50 => 3c=34 => c=34/3≈11.333. So, c=11 or 12.c=11: a=100 -32 -33=35. Then, M=35*16*11=35*176=6160.c=12: a=100 -32 -36=32. M=32*16*12=32*192=6144.So, for b=16, the maximum M is 6160.For b=17:c=11, as above, M=6171.c=12: a=100 -34 -36=30. M=30*17*12=30*204=6120.So, for b=17, maximum M is 6171.Similarly, let's check b=18:From b + 3c=50 => 18 + 3c=50 => 3c=32 => c≈10.666. So, c=10 or 11.c=10: a=100 -36 -30=34. M=34*18*10=34*180=6120.c=11: a=100 -36 -33=31. M=31*18*11=31*198=6138.So, for b=18, maximum M is 6138.So, so far, the maximum is 6171 at b=17, c=11, a=33.Wait, let me check b=17, c=10:a=100 -34 -30=36. M=36*17*10=36*170=6120.Which is less than 6171.Similarly, b=17, c=12: M=6120 as above.So, 6171 seems to be the maximum so far.But let me check if there are other values of c that could give a higher M.Wait, maybe I can vary c more.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the initial approach where I fix c and find the optimal b.Let me try that.Let me express M = (100 - 2b - 3c) * b * c.For each c, M is a quadratic in b: M = (100 - 3c) * b - 2b².The maximum occurs at b = (100 - 3c)/4.So, for each c, compute b ≈ (100 - 3c)/4, then check floor and ceiling.Let me tabulate some values.Let me start with c=10:b ≈ (100 -30)/4=70/4=17.5. So, b=17 or 18.Compute M for c=10, b=17: a=100 -34 -30=36. M=36*17*10=6120.For c=10, b=18: a=100 -36 -30=34. M=34*18*10=6120.So, same.c=11:b≈(100 -33)/4=67/4≈16.75. So, b=16 or 17.c=11, b=16: a=100 -32 -33=35. M=35*16*11=6160.c=11, b=17: a=33. M=33*17*11=6171.c=12:b≈(100 -36)/4=64/4=16. So, b=16.c=12, b=16: a=100 -32 -36=32. M=32*16*12=6144.c=12, b=17: a=100 -34 -36=30. M=30*17*12=6120.c=9:b≈(100 -27)/4=73/4≈18.25. So, b=18 or 19.c=9, b=18: a=100 -36 -27=37. M=37*18*9=37*162=5994.c=9, b=19: a=100 -38 -27=35. M=35*19*9=35*171=5985.c=13:b≈(100 -39)/4=61/4≈15.25. So, b=15 or16.c=13, b=15: a=100 -30 -39=31. M=31*15*13=31*195=6045.c=13, b=16: a=100 -32 -39=29. M=29*16*13=29*208=6032.c=8:b≈(100 -24)/4=76/4=19.c=8, b=19: a=100 -38 -24=38. M=38*19*8=38*152=5776.c=8, b=20: a=100 -40 -24=36. M=36*20*8=36*160=5760.c=14:b≈(100 -42)/4=58/4=14.5. So, b=14 or15.c=14, b=14: a=100 -28 -42=30. M=30*14*14=30*196=5880.c=14, b=15: a=100 -30 -42=28. M=28*15*14=28*210=5880.c=7:b≈(100 -21)/4=79/4≈19.75. So, b=19 or20.c=7, b=19: a=100 -38 -21=41. M=41*19*7=41*133=5453.c=7, b=20: a=100 -40 -21=39. M=39*20*7=39*140=5460.c=15:b≈(100 -45)/4=55/4=13.75. So, b=13 or14.c=15, b=13: a=100 -26 -45=29. M=29*13*15=29*195=5655.c=15, b=14: a=100 -28 -45=27. M=27*14*15=27*210=5670.c=16:b≈(100 -48)/4=52/4=13.c=16, b=13: a=100 -26 -48=26. M=26*13*16=26*208=5408.c=16, b=14: a=100 -28 -48=24. M=24*14*16=24*224=5376.c=6:b≈(100 -18)/4=82/4=20.5. So, b=20 or21.c=6, b=20: a=100 -40 -18=42. M=42*20*6=42*120=5040.c=6, b=21: a=100 -42 -18=40. M=40*21*6=40*126=5040.c=17:b≈(100 -51)/4=49/4≈12.25. So, b=12 or13.c=17, b=12: a=100 -24 -51=25. M=25*12*17=25*204=5100.c=17, b=13: a=100 -26 -51=23. M=23*13*17=23*221=5083.c=5:b≈(100 -15)/4=85/4≈21.25. So, b=21 or22.c=5, b=21: a=100 -42 -15=43. M=43*21*5=43*105=4515.c=5, b=22: a=100 -44 -15=41. M=41*22*5=41*110=4510.c=18:b≈(100 -54)/4=46/4=11.5. So, b=11 or12.c=18, b=11: a=100 -22 -54=24. M=24*11*18=24*198=4752.c=18, b=12: a=100 -24 -54=22. M=22*12*18=22*216=4752.c=4:b≈(100 -12)/4=88/4=22.c=4, b=22: a=100 -44 -12=44. M=44*22*4=44*88=3872.c=4, b=23: a=100 -46 -12=42. M=42*23*4=42*92=3864.c=19:b≈(100 -57)/4=43/4≈10.75.

So, b=0, but b must be positive. So, invalid.So, from all these computations, the maximum M occurs at c=11, b=17, a=33, giving M=6171.Wait, but earlier when I tried c=11, b=17, a=33, M=6171.Is there any higher value? Let me check c=11, b=17, a=33.Wait, let me confirm:a=33, b=17, c=11.a + 2b + 3c =33 +34 +33=100. Correct.M=33*17*11=6171.Is there any other combination that gives a higher M?Looking back at the earlier computations, the next highest was 6160 for c=11, b=16, which is less than 6171.Similarly, for c=10, the M was 6120, which is lower.For c=12, M was 6144, which is still lower.So, 6171 seems to be the maximum.Wait, let me check another approach. Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers for continuous variables and then adjust to integers.So, suppose a, b, c are real numbers.We want to maximize M=abc subject to a + 2b + 3c=100.Using Lagrange multipliers, set up the equations:∇M = λ∇(a + 2b + 3c).So, partial derivatives:dM/da = bc = λ*1dM/db = ac = λ*2dM/dc = ab = λ*3So, from the first equation: bc = λSecond equation: ac = 2λ => ac = 2bc => a = 2bThird equation: ab = 3λ => ab = 3bc => a = 3cSo, from a=2b and a=3c, we get 2b=3c => c=(2/3)b.So, a=2b, c=(2/3)b.Now, plug into the constraint a + 2b + 3c=100.So, 2b + 2b + 3*(2/3)b=100 => 2b + 2b + 2b=100 =>6b=100 =>b=100/6≈16.666...So, b≈16.666, c≈(2/3)*16.666≈11.111, a≈2*16.666≈33.333.So, in the continuous case, the maximum occurs at a≈33.333, b≈16.666, c≈11.111.Since a, b, c must be integers, the closest integers are a=33, b=17, c=11, which is exactly the solution we found earlier.So, this confirms that 6171 is indeed the maximum.Therefore, the greatest value of M=abc is 6171.**Final Answer**The greatest value of ( M ) is boxed{6171}."},{"question":"A local resident, who enjoys daily walks in the Dales, has noticed that the paths have become increasingly flooded due to recent heavy rains. As a result, their favorite 10 km walking route has been reduced in length. The resident is disappointed and decides to calculate the new length of the walk.1. If the amount of rain (in cm) is denoted by ( x ), the relationship between the rain and the reduction in the walking path length (in km) is modeled by the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 ). Solve this equation to determine the possible values of ( x ) (amount of rain) that would result in a complete flood of the path.2. The resident finds an alternative path in the Dales that is still walkable, represented by the rational expression (frac{10x}{x^2 + 3x - 4}). Simplify this expression and determine for which values of ( x ) (amount of rain) this path becomes invalid due to being undefined.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a local resident who loves walking in the Dales, but the paths have been flooded because of heavy rains. Their favorite 10 km route has been reduced in length, and they want to figure out the new length. The problem has two parts. Let me tackle them one by one.**Problem 1: Solving the Quadratic Equation**First, the resident noticed that the amount of rain, denoted by ( x ) in centimeters, affects the reduction in the walking path length. The relationship is modeled by the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 ). They want to know the possible values of ( x ) that would result in a complete flood of the path.Okay, so I need to solve this quadratic equation. Quadratic equations are of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), and they can be solved using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. Let me see if this one factors nicely.Looking at ( x^2 - 4x + 3 ), I need two numbers that multiply to 3 (the constant term) and add up to -4 (the coefficient of the middle term). Let me think: factors of 3 are 1 and 3. If both are negative, they would multiply to positive 3 and add up to -4. So, yes, -1 and -3. So, factoring the quadratic:( x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3) )Wait, hold on. If I factor it as (x - 1)(x - 3), that would give me ( x^2 - 4x + 3 ), which is correct. So, setting each factor equal to zero:( x - 1 = 0 ) => ( x = 1 )( x - 3 = 0 ) => ( x = 3 )So, the solutions are ( x = 1 ) cm and ( x = 3 ) cm of rain. But wait, the question says these are the values that result in a complete flood. So, does that mean when it rains 1 cm or 3 cm, the path is completely flooded? Hmm, that seems a bit counterintuitive because 1 cm of rain doesn't sound like a lot, but maybe in the context of the Dales, it's enough to flood the path. Alternatively, perhaps the quadratic models the reduction in length, and the roots represent the points where the reduction equals the total length, hence complete flood. So, if the original path is 10 km, maybe at 1 cm and 3 cm of rain, the entire path is flooded, making the walkable length zero. That makes sense.So, the possible values of ( x ) are 1 cm and 3 cm.**Problem 2: Simplifying the Rational Expression**Next, the resident found an alternative path, represented by the rational expression ( frac{10x}{x^2 + 3x - 4} ). They want to simplify this expression and determine for which values of ( x ) the path becomes invalid because the expression is undefined.Alright, so a rational expression is undefined when the denominator is zero because division by zero is undefined. So, first, I need to simplify the expression, which likely involves factoring both the numerator and the denominator and canceling any common factors.Looking at the numerator: it's just ( 10x ), which can't be factored further. The denominator is ( x^2 + 3x - 4 ). Let me try factoring that.Looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1. Because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3.So, factoring the denominator:( x^2 + 3x - 4 = (x + 4)(x - 1) )So, now the expression becomes:( frac{10x}{(x + 4)(x - 1)} )Looking at the numerator and denominator, there are no common factors to cancel out. So, the simplified form is ( frac{10x}{(x + 4)(x - 1)} ).Now, to find when the expression is undefined, we set the denominator equal to zero:( (x + 4)(x - 1) = 0 )So, solving for ( x ):( x + 4 = 0 ) => ( x = -4 )( x - 1 = 0 ) => ( x = 1 )But ( x ) represents the amount of rain in centimeters, which can't be negative. So, ( x = -4 ) cm doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, the only value that makes the expression undefined is ( x = 1 ) cm.Wait, but in the first part, ( x = 1 ) cm was one of the solutions where the path was completely flooded. So, does that mean when it rains 1 cm, the original path is flooded, and the alternative path is also undefined? That seems a bit odd. Maybe the alternative path is only valid when the original path is flooded? Or perhaps the alternative path is another route that becomes flooded at 1 cm as well.Alternatively, maybe the resident found another path that is still walkable except when ( x = 1 ) cm. So, at 1 cm of rain, both paths are flooded, making it impossible to walk anywhere. That could be the case.But regardless, mathematically, the expression is undefined at ( x = -4 ) and ( x = 1 ). Since negative rain doesn't make sense, only ( x = 1 ) cm is the value where the alternative path is invalid.So, summarizing:1. The quadratic equation ( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 ) has solutions ( x = 1 ) cm and ( x = 3 ) cm, meaning these amounts of rain result in the path being completely flooded.2. The alternative path is represented by ( frac{10x}{x^2 + 3x - 4} ), which simplifies to ( frac{10x}{(x + 4)(x - 1)} ). This expression is undefined when ( x = -4 ) cm or ( x = 1 ) cm. Since negative rain isn't possible, only ( x = 1 ) cm makes the alternative path invalid.Therefore, the resident can walk the alternative path except when it rains 1 cm, which also floods the original path.**Final Answer**1. The possible values of ( x ) are boxed{1} cm and boxed{3} cm.2. The alternative path is invalid when ( x = boxed{1} ) cm."},{"question":"The restaurant manager has noticed the dedication of one of the workers and decides to promote them to a shift leader position.

The manager provides the following information:- The restaurant needs a total of (2x + 3) staff members on weekdays (Monday to Friday).- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), the restaurant needs (3x - 2) staff members.1. If the total number of staff members required for the week is 70, set up an equation and solve to find the value of (x).2. Once you find the value of (x), calculate how many staff members are needed on a typical Saturday.","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of staff required for the weekdays and the weekends. The weekdays consist of Monday to Friday, which is 5 days, and the weekends are Saturday and Sunday, totaling 2 days.For the weekdays, the restaurant needs (2x + 3) staff members each day. Therefore, the total staff needed for the weekdays is (5 times (2x + 3)).For the weekends, the restaurant needs (3x - 2) staff members each day. Thus, the total staff needed for the weekends is (2 times (3x - 2)).The total staff required for the entire week is given as 70.

Let ( C ) represent the number of bushels of corn donated, and ( W ) represent the number of bushels of wheat donated.From the problem, I know two things:1. The total donation is 150 bushels.2. The amount of corn donated is 20 bushels more than twice the amount of wheat donated.Using this information, I can set up the following system of equations:[begin{cases}C + W = 150 C = 2W + 20end{cases}]Next, I'll solve this system to find the values of ( C ) and ( W ).

Find the number of such subsets ( M ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of subsets M of the set A = {1, 2, ..., 100} such that M contains at least one square number or cube number. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I know that the total number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n. Since A has 100 elements, the total number of subsets is 2^100. But that's the total number of subsets without any restrictions. The problem is asking for subsets that contain at least one square number or cube number. So, I need to figure out how many subsets meet this condition.I remember that when dealing with \\"at least one\\" problems, it's often easier to calculate the total number of subsets and subtract the number of subsets that don't meet the condition. So, in this case, instead of counting all subsets with at least one square or cube, I can subtract the number of subsets that have no squares and no cubes from the total number of subsets.Let me write that down:Number of desired subsets = Total subsets - Subsets with no squares and no cubes.So, mathematically, that would be:Number of desired subsets = 2^100 - Number of subsets with no squares and no cubes.Okay, so now I need to find how many subsets have neither square numbers nor cube numbers. To do this, I should first figure out how many elements in A are square numbers or cube numbers. Then, the remaining elements are neither squares nor cubes, and the number of subsets that can be formed from these remaining elements will be the number of subsets with no squares and no cubes.Wait, actually, it's a bit more precise. The elements that are neither squares nor cubes are the ones we need to consider for the subsets that don't contain any squares or cubes. So, first, I need to find how many elements in A are squares or cubes, and then subtract that from 100 to get the number of elements that are neither. Then, the number of subsets with no squares and no cubes is 2 raised to the number of neither elements.But hold on, I should be careful here. Because some numbers are both squares and cubes, like 1, 64, etc. So, if I just count squares and cubes separately, I might be double-counting those numbers. Therefore, I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of square or cube numbers in A.Alright, so let's define:- Let S be the set of square numbers in A.- Let C be the set of cube numbers in A.- Then, the number of elements that are squares or cubes is |S ∪ C| = |S| + |C| - |S ∩ C|.So, I need to compute |S|, |C|, and |S ∩ C|.First, |S|: the number of square numbers between 1 and 100. Well, the squares are 1^2, 2^2, ..., 10^2, since 10^2 = 100. So, |S| = 10.Next, |C|: the number of cube numbers between 1 and 100. The cubes are 1^3, 2^3, ..., 4^3, since 4^3 = 64 and 5^3 = 125 which is beyond 100. So, |C| = 4.Now, |S ∩ C|: the number of numbers that are both squares and cubes, i.e., sixth powers, since a number that is both a square and a cube is a sixth power. So, let's find how many sixth powers are in A.Sixth powers: 1^6 = 1, 2^6 = 64, 3^6 = 729 which is too big. So, only 1 and 64. Therefore, |S ∩ C| = 2.Therefore, the number of elements that are squares or cubes is |S| + |C| - |S ∩ C| = 10 + 4 - 2 = 12.So, there are 12 elements in A that are squares or cubes.Therefore, the number of elements that are neither squares nor cubes is 100 - 12 = 88.Hence, the number of subsets that contain no squares and no cubes is 2^88.Therefore, going back to the original formula:Number of desired subsets = 2^100 - 2^88.Wait, is that it? Hmm, let me double-check.Total subsets: 2^100.Subsets with no squares and no cubes: 2^88.Therefore, subsets with at least one square or cube: 2^100 - 2^88.Yes, that seems correct.But just to make sure, let me go through the steps again.1. Total number of subsets: 2^100. Correct.2. Number of subsets with no squares and no cubes: To find this, we first find how many elements are neither squares nor cubes.3. Number of squares: 10 (1^2 to 10^2). Correct.4. Number of cubes: 4 (1^3 to 4^3). Correct.5. Number of sixth powers (both squares and cubes): 2 (1^6 and 2^6). Correct.6. So, using inclusion-exclusion, total squares or cubes: 10 + 4 - 2 = 12. Correct.7. Therefore, neither squares nor cubes: 100 - 12 = 88. Correct.8. So, subsets with neither: 2^88. Correct.9. Therefore, desired subsets: 2^100 - 2^88. Correct.Hmm, seems consistent.But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting squares or cubes.Squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100. That's 10 numbers. Correct.Cubes: 1, 8, 27, 64. That's 4 numbers. Correct.Intersection: 1 and 64. So, 2 numbers. Correct.So, 10 + 4 - 2 = 12. Correct.Therefore, 100 - 12 = 88. Correct.Thus, 2^88 subsets have neither squares nor cubes. Therefore, the desired subsets are 2^100 - 2^88.So, the answer is 2^100 - 2^88.Wait, but the problem says \\"M is a subset of A\\", so M can be any size, including the empty set. But in our calculation, we included the empty set in both total subsets and subsets with neither squares nor cubes. So, when we subtract, the empty set is subtracted out, so our desired subsets include all subsets that have at least one square or cube, regardless of their size, including the empty set? Wait, no.Wait, hold on. The empty set is a subset of A, but it doesn't contain any elements, so it doesn't contain any squares or cubes. Therefore, in our desired subsets, we are excluding the empty set. So, is that correct?Wait, the problem says \\"M contains at least one square number or cube number.\\" So, the empty set does not contain any square or cube numbers, so it should not be included in the desired subsets. Therefore, our calculation is correct because we subtracted all subsets that don't contain squares or cubes, including the empty set. So, the result is the number of subsets that have at least one square or cube, which excludes the empty set.But wait, actually, hold on. Let me think again.Total subsets: 2^100 includes all subsets, including the empty set.Subsets with no squares and no cubes: 2^88 includes the empty set as well.Therefore, when we subtract, 2^100 - 2^88, we are subtracting the empty set as well, so the result is the number of subsets that have at least one square or cube, which is exactly what we want.Therefore, the answer is 2^100 - 2^88.But let me check if that's the case. Suppose I have a smaller set, say A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, and I want subsets that contain at least one square or cube.Squares in A: 1, 4.Cubes in A: 1.So, squares or cubes: 1, 4.Neither: 2, 3.Total subsets: 16.Subsets with neither: subsets of {2,3}, which are 4 subsets: {}, {2}, {3}, {2,3}.Therefore, desired subsets: 16 - 4 = 12.Let me list them:All subsets except the ones that don't include 1 or 4.So, subsets that include 1 or 4.But wait, in this case, 1 is both a square and a cube, and 4 is a square.So, let's list all subsets:{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}, {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4}.Now, subsets that contain at least one square or cube: these are all subsets except those that don't contain 1 or 4. The subsets that don't contain 1 or 4 are: {}, {2}, {3}, {2,3}. So, 4 subsets. Therefore, desired subsets: 16 - 4 = 12. Correct.So, in this smaller case, the formula works.Therefore, in the original problem, the formula 2^100 - 2^88 is correct.Therefore, the number of such subsets M is 2^100 - 2^88.But wait, the problem says \\"M contains at least one square number or cube number.\\" So, is that the same as \\"M contains at least one square number or at least one cube number\\"? Yes, that's what it means.So, our calculation is correct.Alternatively, another way to think about it is: the number of subsets that contain at least one square is 2^100 - 2^(100 - 10) = 2^100 - 2^90.Similarly, the number of subsets that contain at least one cube is 2^100 - 2^(100 - 4) = 2^100 - 2^96.But then, if we just add these two, we would be double-counting the subsets that contain both at least one square and at least one cube. So, to correct for that, we need to subtract the number of subsets that contain at least one square and at least one cube.So, using inclusion-exclusion:Number of subsets with at least one square or cube = (Number with at least one square) + (Number with at least one cube) - (Number with at least one square and at least one cube).So, let's compute each term:Number with at least one square: 2^100 - 2^90.Number with at least one cube: 2^100 - 2^96.Number with at least one square and at least one cube: ?Hmm, how do we compute this?Well, the number of subsets that contain at least one square and at least one cube is equal to the total number of subsets minus the subsets that contain no squares minus the subsets that contain no cubes plus the subsets that contain neither squares nor cubes.Wait, that's inclusion-exclusion again.Wait, let me think.Number of subsets with at least one square and at least one cube = Total subsets - subsets with no squares - subsets with no cubes + subsets with neither squares nor cubes.So, that would be:2^100 - 2^90 - 2^96 + 2^88.Therefore, plugging back into inclusion-exclusion:Number of desired subsets = (2^100 - 2^90) + (2^100 - 2^96) - (2^100 - 2^90 - 2^96 + 2^88).Simplify this:= 2^100 - 2^90 + 2^100 - 2^96 - 2^100 + 2^90 + 2^96 - 2^88Simplify term by term:2^100 + 2^100 - 2^100 = 2^100-2^90 + 2^90 = 0-2^96 + 2^96 = 0-2^88 remains.So, total is 2^100 - 2^88.Which is the same result as before.Therefore, whether I approach it directly by subtracting subsets with neither squares nor cubes or use inclusion-exclusion on the counts of squares and cubes, I get the same answer.Therefore, I can be confident that the number of subsets M is 2^100 - 2^88.But just to make sure, let me think about another way.Suppose I fix the elements that are squares or cubes. There are 12 such elements. The rest are 88 elements.To form a subset that contains at least one of the 12 elements, I can think of it as choosing any combination of the 88 elements and then choosing at least one from the 12.So, the number of such subsets is (2^88) * (2^12 - 1).Wait, is that correct?Wait, no. Because when you have two independent sets, the number of subsets that include at least one from the first set is (2^a - 1) * 2^b, where a is the size of the first set and b is the size of the second set.But in this case, the two sets are the squares/cubes (12 elements) and the others (88 elements). So, the number of subsets that include at least one square or cube is (2^12 - 1) * 2^88.But wait, 2^12 - 1 is the number of non-empty subsets of the squares/cubes, and 2^88 is the number of subsets of the others. So, the total number is (2^12 - 1) * 2^88.But let's compute that:(2^12 - 1) * 2^88 = 2^100 - 2^88.Which is the same as before.Therefore, that's another way to get the same result.So, that's consistent.Therefore, regardless of the approach, the answer is 2^100 - 2^88.Hence, the number of such subsets M is 2^100 - 2^88.**Final Answer**The number of such subsets ( M ) is boxed{2^{100} - 2^{88}}."},{"question":"Given F_{1} and F_{2} are two foci of the ellipse C: frac{{x}^{2}}{16}+frac{{y}^{2}}{4}=1, P and Q are two points on C symmetric with respect to the origin, and |PQ|=|F_{1}F_{2}|, then the area of quadrilateral PF_{1}QF_{2} is ____.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about an ellipse, and I need to find the area of a quadrilateral formed by two points on the ellipse and the two foci. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the equation of the ellipse is given as ( frac{x^2}{16} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1 ). I remember that the standard form of an ellipse is ( frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), where ( a ) is the semi-major axis and ( b ) is the semi-minor axis. So, in this case, ( a^2 = 16 ) and ( b^2 = 4 ), which means ( a = 4 ) and ( b = 2 ).Next, I need to recall how to find the foci of an ellipse. The distance from the center to each focus is given by ( c ), where ( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 ). Plugging in the values, ( c^2 = 16 - 4 = 12 ), so ( c = sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3} ). Therefore, the foci ( F_1 ) and ( F_2 ) are located at ( (-2sqrt{3}, 0) ) and ( (2sqrt{3}, 0) ) respectively, since the major axis is along the x-axis.Now, points ( P ) and ( Q ) are on the ellipse and are symmetric with respect to the origin. That means if ( P ) is ( (x, y) ), then ( Q ) must be ( (-x, -y) ). So, the coordinates of ( Q ) are just the negatives of ( P )'s coordinates.The problem also states that the distance between ( P ) and ( Q ) is equal to the distance between the two foci. Let me compute the distance between ( F_1 ) and ( F_2 ) first. Since they are on the x-axis, the distance is just the difference in their x-coordinates. So, ( |F_1F_2| = 2sqrt{3} - (-2sqrt{3}) = 4sqrt{3} ).Therefore, ( |PQ| = 4sqrt{3} ). Let me express ( |PQ| ) in terms of coordinates. If ( P = (x, y) ), then ( Q = (-x, -y) ). The distance between ( P ) and ( Q ) is:[|PQ| = sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2} = sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2} = 2sqrt{x^2 + y^2}]We know this equals ( 4sqrt{3} ), so:[2sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 4sqrt{3}]Divide both sides by 2:[sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 2sqrt{3}]Square both sides:[x^2 + y^2 = 12]So, the points ( P ) and ( Q ) lie on the ellipse and also lie on the circle centered at the origin with radius ( 2sqrt{3} ). Therefore, to find the coordinates of ( P ) and ( Q ), I need to solve the system of equations:1. ( frac{x^2}{16} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1 )2. ( x^2 + y^2 = 12 )Let me solve this system. From equation 2, I can express ( y^2 = 12 - x^2 ). Substitute this into equation 1:[frac{x^2}{16} + frac{12 - x^2}{4} = 1]Let me simplify this equation. Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:[x^2 + 4(12 - x^2) = 16]Expand the terms:[x^2 + 48 - 4x^2 = 16]Combine like terms:[-3x^2 + 48 = 16]Subtract 48 from both sides:[-3x^2 = -32]Divide both sides by -3:[x^2 = frac{32}{3}]Take square roots:[x = pm sqrt{frac{32}{3}} = pm frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}]Now, substitute back into ( y^2 = 12 - x^2 ):[y^2 = 12 - frac{32}{3} = frac{36}{3} - frac{32}{3} = frac{4}{3}]So, ( y = pm frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = pm frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )Therefore, the coordinates of ( P ) can be ( left( frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) ) and ( Q ) would be ( left( -frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) ). Alternatively, ( P ) could be in any of the four quadrants, but since the problem doesn't specify, I can choose one for simplicity.Now, I need to find the area of quadrilateral ( PF_1QF_2 ). Let me visualize this quadrilateral. It has vertices at ( P ), ( F_1 ), ( Q ), and ( F_2 ). Since ( P ) and ( Q ) are symmetric with respect to the origin, and ( F_1 ) and ( F_2 ) are symmetric as well, the quadrilateral is likely a parallelogram or something similar.To find the area, I can use coordinate geometry. One method is to use the shoelace formula, which calculates the area of a polygon given its vertices. Let me list the coordinates of the quadrilateral in order.Let me assign coordinates:- ( P = left( frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )- ( F_1 = (-2sqrt{3}, 0) )- ( Q = left( -frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )- ( F_2 = (2sqrt{3}, 0) )Wait, actually, I need to make sure the quadrilateral is ordered correctly. Since it's ( PF_1QF_2 ), the order is P, F1, Q, F2. So, plotting these points:1. ( P ) is in the first quadrant.2. ( F_1 ) is on the left of the origin.3. ( Q ) is in the third quadrant.4. ( F_2 ) is on the right of the origin.So, connecting P to F1, F1 to Q, Q to F2, and F2 back to P. Hmm, this might form a quadrilateral that crosses over the origin.Alternatively, maybe it's better to use vectors or coordinate geometry to compute the area.Another approach is to recognize that the quadrilateral can be split into two triangles: ( PF_1Q ) and ( QF_2P ). But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, since it's a quadrilateral with vertices in order, the shoelace formula should work.Let me list the coordinates in order:1. ( P = left( frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )2. ( F_1 = (-2sqrt{3}, 0) )3. ( Q = left( -frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )4. ( F_2 = (2sqrt{3}, 0) )And back to ( P ).So, applying the shoelace formula:Area = ( frac{1}{2} | (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1) | )Let me compute each term step by step.First, list all the coordinates:1. ( (x_1, y_1) = left( frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )2. ( (x_2, y_2) = (-2sqrt{3}, 0) )3. ( (x_3, y_3) = left( -frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )4. ( (x_4, y_4) = (2sqrt{3}, 0) )Compute ( x_1y_2 ):( frac{4sqrt{6}}{3} times 0 = 0 )Compute ( x_2y_3 ):( -2sqrt{3} times left( -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) = (-2sqrt{3}) times left( -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )Multiply the constants: ( (-2) times (-2) = 4 )Multiply the radicals: ( sqrt{3} times sqrt{3} = 3 )So, total: ( 4 times 3 / 3 = 4 )Compute ( x_3y_4 ):( -frac{4sqrt{6}}{3} times 0 = 0 )Compute ( x_4y_1 ):( 2sqrt{3} times frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = (2 times 2) times (sqrt{3} times sqrt{3}) / 3 = 4 times 3 / 3 = 4 )Now, sum these up: ( 0 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 8 )Now, compute the other part:Compute ( y_1x_2 ):( frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} times (-2sqrt{3}) = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} times (-2sqrt{3}) )Multiply constants: ( 2 times (-2) = -4 )Multiply radicals: ( sqrt{3} times sqrt{3} = 3 )Total: ( -4 times 3 / 3 = -4 )Compute ( y_2x_3 ):( 0 times left( -frac{4sqrt{6}}{3} right) = 0 )Compute ( y_3x_4 ):( -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} times 2sqrt{3} = (-2sqrt{3}/3) times 2sqrt{3} )Multiply constants: ( -2 times 2 = -4 )Multiply radicals: ( sqrt{3} times sqrt{3} = 3 )Total: ( -4 times 3 / 3 = -4 )Compute ( y_4x_1 ):( 0 times frac{4sqrt{6}}{3} = 0 )Sum these up: ( -4 + 0 + (-4) + 0 = -8 )Now, subtract the second sum from the first sum:( 8 - (-8) = 16 )Take the absolute value (which is still 16) and multiply by 1/2:Area = ( frac{1}{2} times 16 = 8 )Wait, so the area is 8? Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes signs can mess things up.Looking back at the shoelace formula, I think I might have missed some signs. Let me re-examine the terms.First part: ( x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 )- ( x_1y_2 = frac{4sqrt{6}}{3} times 0 = 0 )- ( x_2y_3 = (-2sqrt{3}) times (-frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) = frac{4 times 3}{3} = 4 )- ( x_3y_4 = (-frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}) times 0 = 0 )- ( x_4y_1 = 2sqrt{3} times frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{4 times 3}{3} = 4 )Total: 0 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 8Second part: ( y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1 )- ( y_1x_2 = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} times (-2sqrt{3}) = frac{-4 times 3}{3} = -4 )- ( y_2x_3 = 0 times (-frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}) = 0 )- ( y_3x_4 = (-frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) times 2sqrt{3} = frac{-4 times 3}{3} = -4 )- ( y_4x_1 = 0 times frac{4sqrt{6}}{3} = 0 )Total: -4 + 0 + (-4) + 0 = -8So, subtracting second sum from the first: 8 - (-8) = 16. Absolute value is 16, so area is 16/2 = 8.Okay, seems consistent. So the area is 8.But wait, another way to think about this is that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram because opposite sides are equal and parallel. Since ( P ) and ( Q ) are symmetric, and ( F_1 ) and ( F_2 ) are symmetric, the sides ( PF_1 ) and ( QF_2 ) should be equal and parallel, as well as ( F_1Q ) and ( PF_2 ). So, it's a parallelogram.The area of a parallelogram can also be found by the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides. Let me try this method as a verification.Let me consider vectors ( vec{PF_1} ) and ( vec{PF_2} ). Wait, actually, in a parallelogram, the area is the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides. So, if I take vectors from point ( P ) to ( F_1 ) and from ( P ) to ( F_2 ), their cross product will give the area.Wait, actually, no. In a parallelogram defined by points ( A, B, C, D ), the area is the magnitude of ( vec{AB} times vec{AD} ). So, in this case, if I take vectors from ( P ) to ( F_1 ) and from ( P ) to ( F_2 ), their cross product would give the area.But actually, in this case, the sides are ( PF_1 ) and ( PF_2 ). Wait, no, in the quadrilateral ( PF_1QF_2 ), the sides are ( PF_1 ), ( F_1Q ), ( QF_2 ), and ( F_2P ). So, to compute the area as a parallelogram, I can take vectors ( vec{PF_1} ) and ( vec{PF_2} ), but I need to make sure they are adjacent sides.Wait, perhaps it's better to use coordinates to compute the vectors.Let me define vectors:- ( vec{PF_1} = F_1 - P = (-2sqrt{3} - frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, 0 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) )- ( vec{PF_2} = F_2 - P = (2sqrt{3} - frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, 0 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) )But actually, in the parallelogram, the area is the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides. So, if I take vectors ( vec{PF_1} ) and ( vec{PF_2} ), their cross product will give the area.Wait, but in 2D, the cross product's magnitude is |x1*y2 - x2*y1|.So, let me compute ( vec{PF_1} ) and ( vec{PF_2} ):First, ( vec{PF_1} = F_1 - P = (-2sqrt{3} - frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, 0 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) )Compute the x-component:( -2sqrt{3} - frac{4sqrt{6}}{3} = -frac{6sqrt{3}}{3} - frac{4sqrt{6}}{3} = -frac{6sqrt{3} + 4sqrt{6}}{3} )Y-component:( 0 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )Similarly, ( vec{PF_2} = F_2 - P = (2sqrt{3} - frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, 0 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) )X-component:( 2sqrt{3} - frac{4sqrt{6}}{3} = frac{6sqrt{3}}{3} - frac{4sqrt{6}}{3} = frac{6sqrt{3} - 4sqrt{6}}{3} )Y-component:Same as above: ( -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )Now, the cross product ( vec{PF_1} times vec{PF_2} ) in 2D is:( (x_1y_2 - x_2y_1) )But wait, actually, in 2D, the magnitude of the cross product is |x1*y2 - x2*y1|.So, let me denote:( vec{PF_1} = (a, b) = left( -frac{6sqrt{3} + 4sqrt{6}}{3}, -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )( vec{PF_2} = (c, d) = left( frac{6sqrt{3} - 4sqrt{6}}{3}, -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )Compute ( a*d - c*b ):First, compute ( a*d ):( left( -frac{6sqrt{3} + 4sqrt{6}}{3} right) * left( -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )Multiply the numerators:( (-6sqrt{3} - 4sqrt{6}) * (-2sqrt{3}) = (6sqrt{3} + 4sqrt{6}) * 2sqrt{3} )Compute term by term:- ( 6sqrt{3} * 2sqrt{3} = 12 * 3 = 36 )- ( 4sqrt{6} * 2sqrt{3} = 8 * sqrt{18} = 8 * 3sqrt{2} = 24sqrt{2} )So, total numerator: ( 36 + 24sqrt{2} )Denominator: 3 * 3 = 9So, ( a*d = frac{36 + 24sqrt{2}}{9} = 4 + frac{8sqrt{2}}{3} )Now, compute ( c*b ):( left( frac{6sqrt{3} - 4sqrt{6}}{3} right) * left( -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )Multiply numerators:( (6sqrt{3} - 4sqrt{6}) * (-2sqrt{3}) = -12*3 + 8sqrt{18} = -36 + 8*3sqrt{2} = -36 + 24sqrt{2} )Denominator: 3 * 3 = 9So, ( c*b = frac{-36 + 24sqrt{2}}{9} = -4 + frac{8sqrt{2}}{3} )Now, subtract ( c*b ) from ( a*d ):( (4 + frac{8sqrt{2}}{3}) - (-4 + frac{8sqrt{2}}{3}) = 4 + frac{8sqrt{2}}{3} + 4 - frac{8sqrt{2}}{3} = 8 )So, the magnitude is 8, which is the area of the parallelogram. So, this confirms the shoelace formula result.Therefore, the area is 8.But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to compute the area. Maybe using the properties of the ellipse.I remember that the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to ( 2a ). In this case, ( 2a = 8 ). So, for any point ( P ) on the ellipse, ( |PF_1| + |PF_2| = 8 ).But how does that help with the area? Maybe not directly, but perhaps in combination with other properties.Alternatively, since ( P ) and ( Q ) are symmetric with respect to the origin, the quadrilateral ( PF_1QF_2 ) is a parallelogram, as we thought earlier. So, the area can also be computed as the base times height.But without knowing the base and height, it's not straightforward. Alternatively, since we have coordinates, the shoelace formula and cross product methods are more reliable here.Given that both methods gave me 8, I'm pretty confident the area is 8.Wait, but just to double-check, let me compute the vectors again.Alternatively, maybe using coordinates, I can compute the area by dividing the quadrilateral into triangles.Quadrilateral ( PF_1QF_2 ) can be divided into triangles ( PF_1Q ) and ( QF_2P ). Wait, but actually, that might not cover the entire area correctly. Alternatively, maybe triangles ( PF_1F_2 ) and ( QF_1F_2 ).Wait, perhaps another approach is to note that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, so its area is twice the area of triangle ( PF_1F_2 ).Let me compute the area of triangle ( PF_1F_2 ) and then double it.Using coordinates:- ( P = left( frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) )- ( F_1 = (-2sqrt{3}, 0) )- ( F_2 = (2sqrt{3}, 0) )The area of triangle ( PF_1F_2 ) can be found using the shoelace formula for three points.Formula:Area = ( frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)| )Plugging in:( x_1 = frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}, y_1 = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )( x_2 = -2sqrt{3}, y_2 = 0 )( x_3 = 2sqrt{3}, y_3 = 0 )Compute each term:First term: ( x_1(y_2 - y_3) = frac{4sqrt{6}}{3}(0 - 0) = 0 )Second term: ( x_2(y_3 - y_1) = -2sqrt{3}(0 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) = -2sqrt{3}(-frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) = frac{4 times 3}{3} = 4 )Third term: ( x_3(y_1 - y_2) = 2sqrt{3}(frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} - 0) = 2sqrt{3} times frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{4 times 3}{3} = 4 )Sum: 0 + 4 + 4 = 8Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2:Area = ( frac{1}{2} times 8 = 4 )So, the area of triangle ( PF_1F_2 ) is 4. Therefore, the area of the parallelogram ( PF_1QF_2 ) is twice that, so 8. Yep, that's consistent with the previous results.Therefore, I can be confident that the area is indeed 8.**Final Answer**The area of quadrilateral ( PF_{1}QF_{2} ) is boxed{8}."},{"question":"As a passionate fan of Madeline Brewer, you decide to create a fan blog dedicated to her acting career. You want to analyze how the number of your blog visitors changes based on the number of new posts you publish each week.

What number of new posts per week will maximize the number of visitors to your blog?2. Once you've found the optimal number of posts from part 1, suppose you decide to post that many posts consistently for a few weeks. However, due to a sudden increase in Madeline Brewer's popularity, the number of visitors, ( v ), increases by an additional 30 visitors per week. Write the new quadratic equation reflecting this change, and determine the new maximum number of visitors your blog can receive.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about creating a fan blog for Madeline Brewer, and I need to figure out how the number of new posts affects the number of visitors. The relationship is given by a quadratic equation: ( v = -2p^2 + 12p + 50 ). There are two parts to this problem. Let me tackle them one by one.Starting with the first question: What number of new posts per week will maximize the number of visitors to my blog? Hmm, okay. I remember that quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of ( p^2 ) is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola will be its highest point, which corresponds to the maximum number of visitors. So, I need to find the vertex of this quadratic equation.I recall that the vertex of a parabola given by ( v = ap^2 + bp + c ) is at ( p = -frac{b}{2a} ). Let me write that down. In this equation, ( a = -2 ) and ( b = 12 ). Plugging those into the formula:( p = -frac{12}{2 times (-2)} )Calculating the denominator first: 2 times -2 is -4. So,( p = -frac{12}{-4} )Dividing 12 by 4 gives 3, and the negatives cancel out, so ( p = 3 ). So, according to this, if I post 3 new articles per week, I should get the maximum number of visitors. That seems straightforward. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Wait, so ( a = -2 ) and ( b = 12 ). So, ( -b/(2a) ) is ( -12/(2*(-2)) ) which is ( -12/-4 ) which is indeed 3. Yep, that seems right. So, 3 posts per week will maximize visitors.Moving on to the second question. It says that after finding the optimal number of posts (which we found to be 3), I decide to post that many consistently for a few weeks. Then, due to Madeline Brewer's increased popularity, the number of visitors increases by an additional 30 visitors per week. I need to write the new quadratic equation reflecting this change and determine the new maximum number of visitors.Okay, so the original equation is ( v = -2p^2 + 12p + 50 ). If the number of visitors increases by 30 per week regardless of the number of posts, that should just be a vertical shift in the equation. So, I think I just need to add 30 to the entire equation. Let me write that out.New equation: ( v = -2p^2 + 12p + 50 + 30 ). Simplifying that, 50 + 30 is 80. So, the new equation is ( v = -2p^2 + 12p + 80 ).Now, I need to find the new maximum number of visitors. Since the coefficient of ( p^2 ) is still negative, the parabola still opens downward, so the vertex will still give the maximum point. But wait, is the vertex the same? Let me think. The vertex formula is based on the coefficients ( a ) and ( b ). In this case, ( a ) is still -2 and ( b ) is still 12. So, the value of ( p ) that maximizes ( v ) should still be 3, right?But hold on, the question says \\"determine the new maximum number of visitors your blog can receive.\\" So, maybe they want the value of ( v ) at the vertex, not just the ( p ) value. Let me check.In the original equation, plugging ( p = 3 ) into ( v = -2p^2 + 12p + 50 ):( v = -2(3)^2 + 12(3) + 50 )Calculating each term:- ( (3)^2 = 9 )- ( -2 times 9 = -18 )- ( 12 times 3 = 36 )- So, adding them up: -18 + 36 = 18, then 18 + 50 = 68.So, originally, the maximum visitors were 68.Now, with the new equation ( v = -2p^2 + 12p + 80 ), plugging ( p = 3 ):( v = -2(3)^2 + 12(3) + 80 )Calculating each term:- ( (3)^2 = 9 )- ( -2 times 9 = -18 )- ( 12 times 3 = 36 )- Adding them up: -18 + 36 = 18, then 18 + 80 = 98.So, the new maximum number of visitors is 98.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. The vertex ( p ) value didn't change because the coefficients ( a ) and ( b ) didn't change. Only the constant term ( c ) changed from 50 to 80. So, the vertex is still at ( p = 3 ), but the maximum ( v ) is now 98 instead of 68. That makes sense because adding 30 to the entire equation would shift the graph up by 30 units, so the maximum point would also increase by 30.Alternatively, I could have just added 30 to the original maximum. Since the original maximum was 68, adding 30 gives 98. That's another way to think about it without recalculating the entire equation.Let me just recap:1. To find the number of posts that maximize visitors, use the vertex formula ( p = -b/(2a) ). Here, ( a = -2 ), ( b = 12 ), so ( p = 3 ).2. When the number of visitors increases by 30, the new equation becomes ( v = -2p^2 + 12p + 80 ). The vertex is still at ( p = 3 ), so plugging that back in gives ( v = 98 ).I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key points are recognizing that the vertex gives the maximum for a downward opening parabola and understanding how a vertical shift affects the maximum value without changing the location of the vertex.**Final Answer**1. The optimal number of new posts per week is boxed{3}.2. The new quadratic equation is ( v = -2p^2 + 12p + 80 ) and the new maximum number of visitors is boxed{98}."},{"question":"As a fellow traveler, you have come across an ancient map that the historian claims leads to a hidden treasure. However, you question the accuracy of the historian's stories and decide to verify the clues yourself. The map provides two clues written in the form of algebraic expressions:1. The first clue suggests that the location of the treasure is a point on the parabola described by the equation ( y = x^2 - 6x + 8 ). You need to find the x-coordinate of the vertex of this parabola, which represents the point where the treasure might be located.2. The second clue hints that the treasure is located exactly halfway between two points where the parabola intersects with the line ( y = 2x - 4 ). Find the x-coordinates of these intersection points and calculate their average to determine the x-coordinate of the potential treasure location.","answer":"To find the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola ( y = x^2 - 6x + 8 ), I can use the vertex formula. The general form of a quadratic equation is ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ), and the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ). Here, ( a = 1 ) and ( b = -6 ), so the x-coordinate of the vertex is ( x = -frac{-6}{2(1)} = 3 ).Next, to determine the x-coordinates where the parabola intersects the line ( y = 2x - 4 ), I set the equations equal to each other: ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 2x - 4 ). Rearranging the terms, I get ( x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0 ). Factoring this quadratic equation, I find ( (x - 6)(x - 2) = 0 ), which gives the solutions ( x = 6 ) and ( x = 2 ).Finally, to find the x-coordinate halfway between these two intersection points, I calculate the average of 6 and 2, which is ( frac{6 + 2}{2} = 4 )."},{"question":"A certain shopping mall sells toy A with a purchase price of 60 yuan per unit. According to the requirement, the profit margin per unit at the time of sale must not exceed 40%. Based on market research, when the selling price is set at 80 yuan, 200 units can be sold per day, and for every 1 yuan decrease in the selling price, an additional 20 units can be sold per day. Find the selling price at which the shopping mall can make a profit of 2500 yuan per day selling toy A.","answer":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a shopping mall selling toy A. The purchase price is 60 yuan per unit. The profit margin per unit can't exceed 40%. Hmm, so first, I need to make sure that whatever selling price we come up with doesn't give a profit margin more than 40%.They also mentioned that when the selling price is set at 80 yuan, they can sell 200 units per day. For every 1 yuan decrease in the selling price, they can sell an additional 20 units per day. So, the selling price and the number of units sold are related in a linear way. I think I can model this with some equations.First, let's recall that profit is calculated as (Selling Price - Purchase Price) multiplied by the number of units sold. So, Profit = (P - C) * Q, where P is the selling price, C is the purchase price, and Q is the quantity sold.Given that the purchase price C is 60 yuan. The maximum allowed profit margin is 40%. So, the maximum profit per unit is 40% of the purchase price. Let me calculate that: 40% of 60 yuan is 0.4 * 60 = 24 yuan. So, the selling price can't be more than 60 + 24 = 84 yuan. But wait, the initial selling price is 80 yuan, which is below 84, so that's fine. So, the selling price can be set between some lower value and 84 yuan.But actually, the problem doesn't specify a lower limit on the selling price, so theoretically, it could go as low as needed, but of course, the number of units sold would increase as the price decreases, which might help in achieving the desired profit.So, the goal is to find the selling price P such that the daily profit is 2500 yuan.Let me denote the selling price as P yuan. The number of units sold per day, Q, depends on P. When P is 80, Q is 200. For every 1 yuan decrease, Q increases by 20. So, if the selling price decreases by x yuan from 80, then the new selling price is (80 - x) yuan, and the quantity sold becomes (200 + 20x) units.So, we can write Q as a function of x: Q(x) = 200 + 20x.Similarly, the selling price P(x) = 80 - x.But we need to express everything in terms of P, perhaps. Let me see. If P = 80 - x, then x = 80 - P. So, substituting back into Q, we get Q = 200 + 20*(80 - P). Let me compute that:Q = 200 + 20*(80 - P) = 200 + 1600 - 20P = 1800 - 20P.Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. If P decreases by x, then x = 80 - P, so Q = 200 + 20x = 200 + 20*(80 - P). So, 20*80 is 1600, plus 200 is 1800, minus 20P. So yes, Q = 1800 - 20P. Hmm, that seems correct.But let me test it with P = 80. Then Q = 1800 - 20*80 = 1800 - 1600 = 200. That's correct. If P = 79, then Q = 1800 - 20*79 = 1800 - 1580 = 220. Which is 200 + 20*1 = 220. Correct. So, the formula seems right.So, now, the profit is (P - C) * Q. C is 60 yuan. So, Profit = (P - 60) * (1800 - 20P).We need this profit to be 2500 yuan. So, set up the equation:(P - 60)*(1800 - 20P) = 2500.Let me expand the left side:First, multiply (P - 60) and (1800 - 20P):= P*(1800 - 20P) - 60*(1800 - 20P)= 1800P - 20P² - 108000 + 1200P= (1800P + 1200P) - 20P² - 108000= 3000P - 20P² - 108000.So, the equation becomes:-20P² + 3000P - 108000 = 2500.Let me bring 2500 to the left side:-20P² + 3000P - 108000 - 2500 = 0-20P² + 3000P - 110500 = 0.Hmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:20P² - 3000P + 110500 = 0.Wait, I multiplied both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of P² positive. So, 20P² - 3000P + 110500 = 0.Let me see if I can simplify this equation. All coefficients are divisible by 10, so divide each term by 10:2P² - 300P + 11050 = 0.Hmm, still, maybe we can divide further? Let me check if 2P² - 300P + 11050 can be simplified. 2 is a prime number, so unless 11050 is divisible by 2, which it is, but 300 is also divisible by 2. So, perhaps divide by 2:P² - 150P + 5525 = 0.Wait, 11050 divided by 2 is 5525, and 300 divided by 2 is 150. So, the equation simplifies to P² - 150P + 5525 = 0.Now, let's try to solve this quadratic equation. I can use the quadratic formula:P = [150 ± sqrt(150² - 4*1*5525)] / 2.Compute discriminant D:D = 150² - 4*1*5525 = 22500 - 22100 = 400.So, sqrt(D) = sqrt(400) = 20.Thus, P = [150 ± 20]/2.So, two solutions:P = (150 + 20)/2 = 170/2 = 85,P = (150 - 20)/2 = 130/2 = 65.So, the solutions are P = 85 and P = 65.But wait, earlier we had a constraint that the profit margin can't exceed 40%, which translates to a maximum selling price of 84 yuan. So, P = 85 is above 84, which is not allowed. Therefore, P = 85 is invalid.So, the only valid solution is P = 65 yuan.But let me verify this. If P = 65, then Q = 1800 - 20*65 = 1800 - 1300 = 500 units.Profit would be (65 - 60)*500 = 5*500 = 2500 yuan. Perfect, that's the desired profit.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if P = 85 would be allowed. As we saw, the maximum allowed selling price is 84 yuan. So, 85 is above that, which is not allowed. So, we can't consider P = 85.Therefore, the only feasible solution is P = 65 yuan.But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to model this. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.Wait, when I set up Q as 1800 - 20P, is that correct? Let me think again. If P is 80, Q is 200. For each 1 yuan decrease, Q increases by 20. So, if P decreases by x, Q increases by 20x. So, Q = 200 + 20x. But x = 80 - P, so Q = 200 + 20*(80 - P) = 200 + 1600 - 20P = 1800 - 20P. So, that seems correct.So, the equation is correct. So, the solutions are 85 and 65, but 85 is too high, so 65 is the answer.Wait, but just to think about it, if we set the price at 65, which is 15 yuan below 80, so we would sell 200 + 20*15 = 200 + 300 = 500 units. Then, profit per unit is 65 - 60 = 5 yuan. So, 5*500 = 2500. Perfect.Alternatively, if we tried to set the price higher, like 80, profit per unit is 20 yuan, selling 200 units, so total profit 4000 yuan. That's more than 2500, but we need exactly 2500. So, we need a lower selling price to reduce the profit per unit but increase the number sold.Wait, but actually, when we decrease the price, the profit per unit decreases, but the number sold increases. So, there's a balance where the total profit can be 2500. So, 65 seems to be the correct point.But just to make sure, let me check if there's another possible price. For example, if we set the price at 70, then Q = 1800 - 20*70 = 1800 - 1400 = 400 units. Profit per unit is 10 yuan, so total profit is 10*400 = 4000 yuan. That's still higher than 2500.If we set the price at 75, Q = 1800 - 20*75 = 1800 - 1500 = 300 units. Profit per unit is 15 yuan, so total profit is 15*300 = 4500 yuan. Still higher.Wait, so as we decrease the price from 80, the total profit first increases? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, actually, when we set P = 80, profit is 20*200 = 4000. When we set P = 75, profit is 15*300 = 4500. So, actually, the profit increases as we lower the price from 80 to a certain point, and then starts decreasing.Wait, so maybe there's a maximum profit somewhere, and 2500 is below that maximum. So, there could be two prices where the profit is 2500, one below the maximum and one above. But in our case, we only found one valid solution because the other was above the maximum allowed price.Wait, let me think again. The quadratic equation gave us two solutions, 85 and 65. 85 is above the maximum allowed price, so only 65 is valid. So, 65 is the only solution.But let me check, if I set P = 60, which is the purchase price, then Q would be 1800 - 20*60 = 1800 - 1200 = 600 units. Profit would be 0 yuan, which is expected.If I set P = 50, Q = 1800 - 20*50 = 1800 - 1000 = 800 units. Profit per unit is 50 - 60 = negative 10, so total loss is 8000 yuan. So, that's bad.So, the profit function is a quadratic that opens downward because the coefficient of P² is negative in the original equation. Wait, in our equation, after simplifying, we had 20P² - 3000P + 110500 = 0, which is a quadratic opening upwards, but when we set it to zero, the solutions are 85 and 65. Hmm, but the original profit function is (P - 60)*(1800 - 20P), which is a quadratic in P, and since the coefficient of P² is negative, it opens downward, meaning it has a maximum point.So, the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex occurs at P = -b/(2a). In the equation -20P² + 3000P - 108000, a = -20, b = 3000. So, vertex at P = -3000/(2*(-20)) = -3000/(-40) = 75. So, maximum profit occurs at P = 75 yuan.At P = 75, profit is (75 - 60)*(1800 - 20*75) = 15*300 = 4500 yuan, which matches our earlier calculation.So, the profit function increases as P decreases from 80 to 75, reaching a maximum at 75, and then decreases as P continues to decrease below 75.Therefore, the equation (P - 60)*(1800 - 20P) = 2500 will have two solutions: one between 75 and 80, and another below 75. But in our case, the solution above 75 is 85, which is above the maximum allowed price of 84, so it's invalid. The other solution is 65, which is below 75, so it's valid.Therefore, the only feasible selling price is 65 yuan.Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if 65 is indeed the correct answer. So, selling price 65, quantity sold 500, profit per unit 5, total profit 2500. Correct.Alternatively, if we set P = 84, which is the maximum allowed, then Q = 1800 - 20*84 = 1800 - 1680 = 120 units. Profit per unit is 84 - 60 = 24 yuan. So, total profit is 24*120 = 2880 yuan, which is more than 2500. So, if we set the price at 84, we get a higher profit than needed. So, to get exactly 2500, we need to set the price lower than 84, but not too low that the profit drops below 2500.Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, the only valid solution is 65. Let me check if there's another price between 75 and 80 that gives 2500 profit. Wait, but according to the quadratic equation, the other solution is 85, which is above 84, so it's invalid. So, there's no solution between 75 and 80. So, the only valid solution is 65.Therefore, the selling price should be set at 65 yuan to achieve a daily profit of 2500 yuan.**Final Answer**The selling price should be set at boxed{65} yuan."},{"question":"As a beginner blogger, you are trying to format your blog posts to ensure that they look appealing to your readers.

Set up and solve the inequality to find the possible values for ( n ).","answer":"Okay, so I have two problems to solve here. Let me start with the first one about the blog post sections. Hmm, it's about figuring out how many sentences each section should have. The sections are Introduction, Body, and Conclusion. The problem says the Introduction is 4 sentences less than twice the number of sentences in the Conclusion. Let me denote the number of sentences in the Conclusion as C. Then, the Introduction would be 2C - 4. Got that part.Next, the Body contains three times as many sentences as the Conclusion. So, if the Conclusion is C, then the Body is 3C. That makes sense.The total number of sentences in the post is 68. So, adding up all the sections: Introduction + Body + Conclusion = 68. Substituting the expressions I have:(2C - 4) + 3C + C = 68Let me simplify that equation. Combine like terms:2C - 4 + 3C + C = 68Adding up the C terms: 2C + 3C + C is 6C. So,6C - 4 = 68Now, solving for C. I'll add 4 to both sides:6C = 72Then, divide both sides by 6:C = 12So, the Conclusion has 12 sentences. Now, let's find the Introduction:2C - 4 = 2*12 - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20And the Body is 3C = 3*12 = 36Let me check if these add up to 68: 20 + 36 + 12 = 68. Yep, that works.Alright, that was the first problem. Now, moving on to the second one about formatting time. The time t in minutes is given by the quadratic equation t = 2n² + 3n + 5, where n is the number of formatting elements. I need to find the maximum n such that t is under 50 minutes.So, the inequality is:2n² + 3n + 5 < 50Let me subtract 50 from both sides to set it to less than zero:2n² + 3n + 5 - 50 < 0Simplify:2n² + 3n - 45 < 0Now, I need to solve this quadratic inequality. First, let me find the roots of the equation 2n² + 3n - 45 = 0.Using the quadratic formula: n = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)Here, a = 2, b = 3, c = -45.Calculating the discriminant:b² - 4ac = 9 - 4*2*(-45) = 9 + 360 = 369So, sqrt(369). Let me see, 19² is 361, 20² is 400, so sqrt(369) is approximately 19.209.So, the roots are:n = [-3 ± 19.209]/4Calculating both roots:First root: (-3 + 19.209)/4 ≈ 16.209/4 ≈ 4.052Second root: (-3 - 19.209)/4 ≈ -22.209/4 ≈ -5.552Since n represents the number of formatting elements, it can't be negative. So, we only consider the positive root, approximately 4.052.The quadratic opens upwards because the coefficient of n² is positive. So, the inequality 2n² + 3n - 45 < 0 is satisfied between the two roots. But since n can't be negative, the relevant interval is from 0 to approximately 4.052.But n has to be an integer because you can't use a fraction of a formatting element. So, the maximum integer less than 4.052 is 4.Let me verify this. If n = 4:t = 2*(4)^2 + 3*4 + 5 = 2*16 + 12 + 5 = 32 + 12 + 5 = 49 minutes. That's under 50.If n = 5:t = 2*25 + 15 + 5 = 50 + 15 + 5 = 70 minutes. That's over 50.So, the maximum number of formatting elements is 4.Wait, but let me double-check the quadratic solution. The exact roots are at n = [-3 ± sqrt(369)]/4. Since sqrt(369) is irrational, the exact value is a bit more precise. But since n must be an integer, 4 is the correct maximum.So, that's my reasoning for both problems.**Final Answer**1. The Introduction has boxed{20} sentences, the Body has boxed{36} sentences, and the Conclusion has boxed{12} sentences.2.

The question is asking if it's possible that the number of students who made more than 5 mistakes is greater than the number of students who made fewer than 4 mistakes. Hmm, okay, let me try to wrap my head around this.First, let me rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. There are 333 students, and together they made 1000 mistakes. We need to determine if it's possible that more students made more than 5 mistakes than those who made fewer than 4 mistakes. So, essentially, can the count of students with >5 mistakes be greater than the count of students with <4 mistakes?Let me break this down. Let's denote:- Let A be the number of students who made fewer than 4 mistakes. So, A is the number of students with 0, 1, 2, or 3 mistakes.- Let B be the number of students who made more than 5 mistakes. So, B is the number of students with 6, 7, 8, ..., up to some maximum number of mistakes.- Let C be the number of students who made exactly 4 or 5 mistakes. So, C is the number of students with 4 or 5 mistakes.Since every student is accounted for, we have A + B + C = 333.Our goal is to see if B > A is possible.Now, the total number of mistakes is 1000. Let's express this in terms of A, B, and C as well.Assuming the worst case for A, which is that each student in A made the maximum number of mistakes possible without exceeding 3. So, each student in A made 3 mistakes. Similarly, for B, to minimize the total mistakes, we can assume each student in B made the minimum number of mistakes required to be in B, which is 6. For C, the students made either 4 or 5 mistakes, so let's assume the minimum for C as well, which is 4, to see if that's possible.Wait, actually, if we want to minimize the total number of mistakes, we should assign the minimum number of mistakes to each group. But in this case, we need to see if B can be greater than A while still keeping the total mistakes at 1000. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Pigeonhole Principle or some inequality to find the maximum possible B and see if it can exceed A.Let me think. If we want B to be as large as possible, we need to minimize the number of mistakes made by the other students, i.e., minimize the mistakes made by A and C. So, if A is the number of students with fewer than 4 mistakes, to minimize their total mistakes, we can assume each of them made 0 mistakes. Similarly, for C, which is the number of students with 4 or 5 mistakes, to minimize their total mistakes, we can assume each of them made 4 mistakes.Wait, but if we set A to have 0 mistakes, that might not be the case because some students might have made 1, 2, or 3 mistakes. But if we want to minimize the total mistakes, assigning the minimum number of mistakes to A and C would allow B to be as large as possible. So, let's proceed with that.So, if A students made 0 mistakes, C students made 4 mistakes, and B students made 6 mistakes, then the total number of mistakes would be 0*A + 4*C + 6*B = 4C + 6B.But we know that A + B + C = 333, so A = 333 - B - C.We also know that the total mistakes are 1000, so 4C + 6B = 1000.Our goal is to maximize B while keeping A as small as possible, but we need to see if B can be greater than A.Wait, but if we set A to 0, then C + B = 333, and 4C + 6B = 1000.Let me solve these equations:From A = 0, we have C = 333 - B.Substitute into the total mistakes equation:4*(333 - B) + 6B = 1000Calculate 4*333: 4*300=1200, 4*33=132, so total 1200+132=1332.So, 1332 - 4B + 6B = 1000Simplify: 1332 + 2B = 1000Then, 2B = 1000 - 1332 = -332So, B = -332 / 2 = -166Hmm, that's not possible because B can't be negative. So, setting A=0 is not feasible because it leads to a negative number of students in B, which is impossible.Therefore, we need to have some students in A. So, let's try to find the minimum number of students in A such that B can be greater than A.Let me denote:Let’s let A be the number of students with fewer than 4 mistakes, so they can have 0,1,2,3 mistakes.To minimize the total mistakes, we can assume each student in A made 0 mistakes, but as we saw, that leads to a negative B, which isn't possible. So, perhaps we need to assign some mistakes to A to make the total mistakes positive.Wait, maybe instead of assuming A made 0 mistakes, we should assign them the minimum number of mistakes, which is 0, but since that didn't work, perhaps we need to assign some mistakes to A.Alternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to maximize B while keeping A as small as possible.Let me think about it in terms of inequalities.We have:Total mistakes = sum of mistakes by all students = 1000.Let’s denote:- Let x be the number of students with fewer than 4 mistakes (A).- Let y be the number of students with more than 5 mistakes (B).- Let z be the number of students with exactly 4 or 5 mistakes (C).So, x + y + z = 333.Total mistakes: Let’s denote the mistakes made by each group.For x students: Each can make at most 3 mistakes, so total mistakes from x is ≤ 3x.For z students: Each can make at least 4 and at most 5 mistakes, so total mistakes from z is ≥4z and ≤5z.For y students: Each makes at least 6 mistakes, so total mistakes from y is ≥6y.So, total mistakes: 3x + 4z + 6y ≥ 1000.But we know that total mistakes are exactly 1000, so:3x + 4z + 6y = 1000.But since z = 333 - x - y, we can substitute:3x + 4*(333 - x - y) + 6y = 1000.Let me compute this:3x + 4*333 - 4x - 4y + 6y = 1000Simplify:3x -4x + (-4y +6y) + 1332 = 1000Which is:(-x) + 2y + 1332 = 1000So, -x + 2y = 1000 - 1332 = -332Thus, -x + 2y = -332Multiply both sides by -1:x - 2y = 332So, x = 2y + 332.But we also know that x + y + z = 333, and z = 333 - x - y.So, substituting x = 2y + 332 into z:z = 333 - (2y + 332) - y = 333 - 2y - 332 - y = (333 - 332) - 3y = 1 - 3y.But z cannot be negative, so 1 - 3y ≥ 0 ⇒ 3y ≤ 1 ⇒ y ≤ 1/3.But y must be an integer ≥0, so y can be 0.But if y=0, then x = 2*0 + 332 = 332, and z=1 - 0=1.So, in this case, x=332, y=0, z=1.But we need to check if this satisfies the total mistakes:Total mistakes = 3x + 4z + 6y = 3*332 + 4*1 + 6*0 = 996 + 4 + 0 = 1000.Yes, that works.But in this case, y=0, so the number of students with more than 5 mistakes is 0, which is not greater than x=332.So, this is the case where y is as large as possible, but it's only 0.Wait, that seems contradictory. If y can't be more than 0, then how can we have y > x?Wait, perhaps my approach is flawed.Let me think again.We have x = 2y + 332.But since x + y ≤ 333, because z must be non-negative.So, x + y = (2y + 332) + y = 3y + 332 ≤ 333.Thus, 3y ≤ 1 ⇒ y ≤ 1/3.So, y must be 0.Therefore, in this model, y cannot be more than 0, which suggests that it's impossible for y to be greater than x.But that seems counterintuitive because the problem is asking if it's possible, so maybe my model is wrong.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the inequalities.Let me go back.I assumed that the total mistakes are 3x + 4z + 6y = 1000.But actually, the total mistakes can be more than that because:- For x students, they can make up to 3 mistakes each, but they could make fewer, so the total mistakes from x is ≤3x.- For z students, they make at least 4 and at most 5, so total mistakes from z is between 4z and 5z.- For y students, they make at least 6, so total mistakes from y is ≥6y.But since the total is exactly 1000, we have:Total mistakes = sum of mistakes from x + sum from z + sum from y = 1000.But to find the maximum possible y, we need to minimize the total mistakes from x and z.So, to maximize y, we need to minimize the mistakes from x and z.So, to minimize the total mistakes, we can set:- x students make 0 mistakes each.- z students make 4 mistakes each.- y students make 6 mistakes each.Thus, total mistakes = 0*x + 4*z + 6*y = 4z + 6y = 1000.And we have x + y + z = 333.So, x = 333 - y - z.Substituting into the total mistakes equation:4z + 6y = 1000.We can express z in terms of y:z = (1000 - 6y)/4 = 250 - (3/2)y.Since z must be an integer ≥0, 250 - (3/2)y ≥0 ⇒ y ≤ (250*2)/3 ≈ 166.666, so y ≤166.Also, since z must be an integer, (1000 -6y) must be divisible by 4.So, 1000 -6y ≡0 mod4.1000 mod4= 0, since 1000=4*250.6y mod4= (6 mod4)*(y mod4)=2*(y mod4).So, 2*(y mod4) ≡0 mod4 ⇒ y mod4 must be 0 or 2.Because 2*0=0, 2*2=4≡0 mod4.So, y must be even.Thus, y can be 0,2,4,...,166.Now, our goal is to have y > x.But x = 333 - y - z.We have z=250 - (3/2)y.So, x=333 - y - (250 - (3/2)y)=333 - y -250 + (3/2)y= (333-250) + (-y + (3/2)y)=83 + (1/2)y.So, x=83 + (1/2)y.We need y > x ⇒ y >83 + (1/2)y ⇒ y - (1/2)y >83 ⇒ (1/2)y >83 ⇒ y>166.But earlier, we found that y ≤166.So, y must be greater than 166 to have y >x, but y cannot exceed 166.Therefore, it's impossible for y >x.Wait, that's a contradiction because the problem is asking if it's possible.Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.Let me double-check.We have:Total mistakes: 4z +6y=1000.z=250 - (3/2)y.x=333 - y - z=333 - y - (250 - (3/2)y)=333 - y -250 + (3/2)y=83 + (1/2)y.So, x=83 + (1/2)y.We need y >x ⇒ y >83 + (1/2)y ⇒ (1/2)y >83 ⇒ y>166.But since y ≤166, as per the total mistakes equation, y cannot exceed 166.Therefore, y cannot be greater than 166, and thus y cannot be greater than x=83 + (1/2)y.So, the maximum y can be is 166, which would make x=83 + (1/2)*166=83 +83=166.So, when y=166, x=166, and z=250 - (3/2)*166=250 -249=1.Thus, x=166, y=166, z=1.In this case, y=x=166, so y is not greater than x.Therefore, it's impossible for y to be greater than x.Wait, but the problem is asking if it's possible that the number of students who made more than 5 mistakes is greater than the number of students who made fewer than 4 mistakes.So, according to this, it's not possible because y cannot exceed 166, and x would be at least 83 + (1/2)y, which when y=166, x=166.Therefore, y cannot be greater than x.But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption by setting x students to make 0 mistakes. Maybe if some students in x make more than 0 mistakes, that would allow y to be larger.Wait, let me think again.If I don't set x students to make 0 mistakes, but instead allow them to make some mistakes, maybe that would allow y to be larger.Wait, but if x students make more mistakes, that would increase the total mistakes, which might allow y to be smaller, not larger.Wait, no, actually, if x students make more mistakes, that would take away from the total mistakes that y students can have, thus possibly allowing y to be smaller, but we want y to be as large as possible.Wait, no, to maximize y, we need to minimize the total mistakes from x and z.So, to minimize the total mistakes from x and z, we set x students to make 0 mistakes and z students to make 4 mistakes each.Thus, the initial approach was correct.Therefore, the conclusion is that y cannot exceed 166, and when y=166, x=166, so y cannot be greater than x.Therefore, it's impossible for the number of students who made more than 5 mistakes to be greater than the number of students who made fewer than 4 mistakes.Wait, but the problem is asking if it's possible, so the answer would be no.But let me check again.Suppose we have y=167, then x=83 + (1/2)*167=83 +83.5=166.5, which is not an integer, but even if we ignore that, z=250 - (3/2)*167=250 -250.5= -0.5, which is negative, impossible.So, y cannot be 167.Thus, the maximum y is 166, which gives x=166, z=1.Therefore, y cannot be greater than x.Hence, it's not possible.Wait, but let me think differently.Maybe instead of assuming z students make exactly 4 mistakes, some of them make 5, which would increase the total mistakes, allowing y to be smaller, but we want y to be as large as possible.Wait, no, to maximize y, we need to minimize the total mistakes from z, so setting z students to make 4 mistakes each is correct.Alternatively, maybe we can have some students in x make more than 0 mistakes, but that would increase the total mistakes, which would require y to be smaller to keep the total at 1000.So, no, that approach wouldn't help.Alternatively, perhaps some students in x make more mistakes, but that would require others to make fewer, but I don't think that would help in maximizing y.Wait, perhaps I can model this as an optimization problem.Let me define variables:Let x = number of students with <4 mistakes (0-3).Let y = number of students with >5 mistakes (6+).Let z = number of students with 4 or 5 mistakes.We have:x + y + z =333.Total mistakes: Let’s denote:Mistakes from x: Let’s denote m_x, where m_x ≤3x.Mistakes from z: m_z, where 4z ≤m_z ≤5z.Mistakes from y: m_y ≥6y.Total: m_x + m_z + m_y =1000.We need to maximize y, so we need to minimize m_x and m_z.Thus, set m_x=0 (each x student makes 0 mistakes), m_z=4z (each z student makes 4 mistakes), and m_y=6y.Thus, 0 +4z +6y=1000.From x + y + z=333, x=333 - y - z.Substitute z=(1000 -6y)/4=250 - (3/2)y.Thus, x=333 - y - (250 - (3/2)y)=333 - y -250 + (3/2)y=83 + (1/2)y.We need y >x ⇒ y >83 + (1/2)y ⇒ (1/2)y >83 ⇒ y>166.But y must be ≤166 because z=250 - (3/2)y ≥0 ⇒ y ≤166.666, so y≤166.Thus, y cannot exceed 166, and when y=166, x=83 +83=166.Therefore, y cannot be greater than x.Hence, it's impossible.Therefore, the answer is no, it's not possible.But wait, the problem is asking \\"Is it possible that the number of students who made more than 5 mistakes is greater than the number of students who made fewer than 4 mistakes?\\"So, according to my calculations, it's not possible.But let me think again.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that m_x=0. Maybe if some students in x make more than 0 mistakes, that could allow y to be larger.Wait, but if m_x increases, that would take away from the total mistakes, which would require y to be smaller, not larger.Wait, no, because if m_x increases, that would mean more mistakes are allocated to x, which would leave fewer mistakes for y, thus y would have to be smaller.Therefore, to maximize y, we need to minimize m_x and m_z.Thus, my initial approach was correct.Therefore, the conclusion is that it's not possible for y to be greater than x.Hence, the answer is no."},{"question":"Consider a retired professional Indonesian footballer who played in the same era as Ferril Raymond Hattu. During his career, he scored a total of ( x ) goals over ( y ) seasons. At the end of his career, he decided to donate a portion of his earnings to support young footballers in Indonesia. The amount he decided to donate each year is represented by the quadratic expression ( D(y) = ay^2 + by + c ), where ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are constants.1. If the footballer scored an average of 15 goals per season and the total number of goals he scored is represented by the polynomial equation ( f(y) = 15y ), find the possible values of ( y ) if the total number of goals scored was 225.2. Given that the donation amount ( D(y) ) each year is expressed as ( D(y) = 2y^2 - 3y + 5 ), determine the donation amount when the footballer played for the number of seasons found in sub-problem 1.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a retired Indonesian footballer, and I need to solve two parts. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, part 1: It says the footballer scored an average of 15 goals per season, and the total number of goals he scored is represented by the polynomial equation f(y) = 15y. They want the possible values of y if the total number of goals was 225.Hmm, okay. So, f(y) is 15y, and the total goals are 225. So, I think I need to set up the equation 15y = 225 and solve for y. That should give me the number of seasons he played.Let me write that down:15y = 225To solve for y, I can divide both sides by 15.y = 225 / 15Calculating that, 225 divided by 15 is... let me do the division. 15 times 15 is 225, right? So, y = 15.Wait, so he played for 15 seasons? That seems reasonable. So, the possible value of y is 15. Since it's a linear equation, there's only one solution here.Okay, moving on to part 2. The donation amount each year is given by D(y) = 2y² - 3y + 5. They want the donation amount when the footballer played for the number of seasons found in part 1, which is y = 15.So, I need to plug y = 15 into the quadratic expression D(y).Let me write that out:D(15) = 2*(15)² - 3*(15) + 5First, calculate 15 squared. 15*15 is 225.So, 2*225 is 450.Next, calculate 3*15, which is 45.So, putting it all together:D(15) = 450 - 45 + 5Now, subtract 45 from 450: 450 - 45 is 405.Then, add 5: 405 + 5 is 410.So, D(15) is 410.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, 15 squared is indeed 225. Multiply by 2: 225*2=450. Correct.Then, 3*15 is 45. So, subtracting 45 from 450 gives 405. Then adding 5 gives 410. Yep, that seems right.So, the donation amount when he played for 15 seasons is 410.Wait, but just to make sure, let me go through the steps again.D(y) = 2y² - 3y + 5Substitute y = 15:2*(15)^2 - 3*(15) + 515 squared is 225, so 2*225 is 450.3*15 is 45.So, 450 - 45 is 405, then 405 + 5 is 410.Yep, that's consistent.So, I think I've got both parts solved.**Final Answer**1. The possible value of ( y ) is boxed{15}.2. The donation amount is boxed{410}."},{"question":"The compass's legs are located at the vertices of an infinite sheet of graph paper with each cell being a square with a side length of 1. It is permissible to, without changing the compass's radius, rotate it around one of the legs to move the other leg to another vertex on the sheet. Is it possible, in a few such steps, to switch the positions of the compass's legs?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a compass on an infinite graph paper. The compass has two legs, each at a vertex of the grid. The grid cells are squares with side length 1. The question is whether it's possible, in a few steps, to switch the positions of the compass's legs. The allowed operation is to rotate the compass around one of its legs without changing the radius, moving the other leg to another vertex.Hmm, let me try to visualize this. Imagine two points on a grid, say point A and point B. The compass has its legs at A and B, so the distance between them is fixed as the radius. Now, I can rotate the compass around either A or B, keeping the radius the same, and move the other leg to a new vertex. The goal is to swap A and B's positions through such rotations.First, I should figure out what kind of moves are possible. If I rotate around point A, point B will move along a circle centered at A with radius equal to AB. Similarly, rotating around B will move A along a circle centered at B. Since the grid is made up of squares with integer coordinates, the possible positions after rotation must also be integer coordinates.Let me denote the initial positions of the compass legs as points (0,0) and (a,b), where a and b are integers. The distance between them is sqrt(a² + b²). When I rotate around (0,0), the other leg will move to another point (c,d) such that the distance from (0,0) to (c,d) is the same as from (0,0) to (a,b). Similarly, rotating around (a,b) will move (0,0) to some (e,f) with the same distance.So, the key here is that each rotation moves one leg to another point at the same distance from the fixed leg. Therefore, the set of possible positions for each leg is constrained by the circle of radius sqrt(a² + b²) centered at the fixed leg.Now, to swap the legs, we need to find a sequence of such rotations that moves (0,0) to (a,b) and (a,b) to (0,0). Let's think about how this can be done.Suppose we start by rotating around (0,0). The other leg, at (a,b), will move to some other point (c,d). Then, perhaps we can rotate around (c,d) to move (0,0) somewhere else, and so on, until we reach the desired positions.But wait, each time we rotate, we can only move one leg at a time, and the other leg remains fixed. So, to swap the legs, we need to somehow move each leg to the other's original position through a series of intermediate steps.Let me consider a simple case where the compass is initially at (0,0) and (1,0). The distance is 1. If I rotate around (0,0), the other leg can move to (0,1) or (0,-1), but not to (1,0) because that's the original position. Similarly, rotating around (1,0) can move (0,0) to (1,1) or (1,-1). Hmm, but in this case, the distance is 1, so the possible moves are limited.Wait, in this case, can we actually swap the legs? Let's see:1. Start with legs at (0,0) and (1,0).2. Rotate around (0,0) to move (1,0) to (0,1). Now legs are at (0,0) and (0,1).3. Rotate around (0,1) to move (0,0) to (1,1). Now legs are at (1,1) and (0,1).4. Rotate around (1,1) to move (0,1) to (1,0). Now legs are at (1,1) and (1,0).5. Rotate around (1,0) to move (1,1) to (0,0). Now legs are at (0,0) and (1,0).Wait, that just brings us back to the original position. Hmm, maybe I need a different sequence.Alternatively:1. Start at (0,0) and (1,0).2. Rotate around (1,0) to move (0,0) to (1,1). Now legs are at (1,1) and (1,0).3. Rotate around (1,1) to move (1,0) to (0,1). Now legs are at (1,1) and (0,1).4. Rotate around (0,1) to move (1,1) to (0,0). Now legs are at (0,0) and (0,1).5. Rotate around (0,0) to move (0,1) to (1,0). Now legs are at (0,0) and (1,0).Again, back to the start. It seems like in this case, with distance 1, it's not possible to swap the legs because the moves just cycle through positions without achieving the swap.But maybe if the initial distance is different? Let's try with a distance of sqrt(2), say starting at (0,0) and (1,1).1. Start at (0,0) and (1,1).2. Rotate around (0,0) to move (1,1) to (1,-1). Now legs are at (0,0) and (1,-1).3. Rotate around (1,-1) to move (0,0) to (2,-1). Now legs are at (2,-1) and (1,-1).4. Rotate around (2,-1) to move (1,-1) to (2,0). Now legs are at (2,-1) and (2,0).5. Rotate around (2,0) to move (2,-1) to (1,0). Now legs are at (1,0) and (2,0).6. Rotate around (1,0) to move (2,0) to (1,1). Now legs are at (1,0) and (1,1).7. Rotate around (1,1) to move (1,0) to (0,1). Now legs are at (0,1) and (1,1).8. Rotate around (0,1) to move (1,1) to (0,0). Now legs are at (0,1) and (0,0).9. Rotate around (0,0) to move (0,1) to (1,0). Now legs are at (0,0) and (1,0).Hmm, still not swapped. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Perhaps instead of trying specific examples, I should think about the problem more abstractly.Each rotation is essentially reflecting one point over the other, but constrained to the grid. Wait, no, rotation isn't reflection. Reflection would flip the point over the center, but rotation can move it in a circular path.But on a grid, the possible positions after rotation are limited to points that are integer distances away. So, for a given radius, the possible positions are the lattice points on the circle of that radius.Therefore, the problem reduces to whether we can move each leg along the circle to the other's original position through a series of such rotations.But perhaps there's a parity issue or something related to the coordinates. Let me think about the coordinates modulo something.Suppose the initial points are (0,0) and (a,b). After each rotation, the coordinates of the moving leg will change, but the parity (whether the sum of coordinates is even or odd) might change or stay the same.Wait, when you rotate a point (x,y) around another point (c,d) by 90 degrees, the new point becomes (c - (y - d), d + (x - c)). So, the change in coordinates is ( - (y - d), (x - c)). Therefore, the parity of the coordinates might change depending on the rotation.But actually, the parity of the sum x + y might change or not. Let's see:If we rotate (x,y) around (c,d), the new point is (c - (y - d), d + (x - c)) = (c - y + d, d + x - c). So, the sum of the new coordinates is (c - y + d) + (d + x - c) = (-y + d + d + x) = x - y + 2d. The original sum was x + y. So, the new sum is x - y + 2d. The difference between the new sum and the old sum is (x - y + 2d) - (x + y) = -2y + 2d = 2(d - y). So, the parity of the sum changes by 2(d - y), which is even. Therefore, the parity of the sum remains the same.Therefore, if the initial sum x + y is even, it remains even after any rotation. Similarly, if it's odd, it remains odd.So, if the two legs start at points with sums of coordinates of different parity, it might be impossible to swap them because swapping would require changing the parity of one leg's position.Wait, let's test this. Suppose one leg is at (0,0), sum 0 (even), and the other at (1,0), sum 1 (odd). If we try to swap them, the leg at (0,0) would have to move to (1,0), which has an odd sum, but since it started at even, it can't reach an odd sum. Similarly, the leg at (1,0) can't reach (0,0) because it started at odd. Therefore, in this case, swapping is impossible.But in the previous example where the legs were at (0,0) and (1,1), both have sum 0 and 2, both even. So, in that case, maybe swapping is possible?Wait, let's see. If both legs start at even sums, then their sums remain even after any rotation. So, if we can move each leg to the other's position, which also has the same parity, then it might be possible.But in the earlier attempt with (0,0) and (1,1), I couldn't find a sequence to swap them. Maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, perhaps the key is whether the distance squared is even or odd. The distance squared between (0,0) and (a,b) is a² + b². If this is even, then the coordinates of the moving point will always have a certain parity. If it's odd, maybe different.Wait, let's think about the coordinates after rotation. If the distance squared is even, then a² + b² is even, which implies that a and b are both even or both odd. Similarly, if the distance squared is odd, then one of a or b is even and the other is odd.So, when rotating, the new coordinates must satisfy the same distance squared, so their parities must be consistent with the original.Therefore, if the initial distance squared is even, the moving leg must always land on points where the coordinates have the same parity as the original. If it's odd, the coordinates must have opposite parity.Therefore, if the two legs start at points where the sum of coordinates have different parities, it's impossible to swap them because the moving leg can't change its parity.But if both legs start at points with the same parity, then maybe it's possible.Wait, in the first example, (0,0) and (1,0): (0,0) has sum 0 (even), (1,0) has sum 1 (odd). So, different parities. Therefore, swapping is impossible.In the second example, (0,0) and (1,1): both have even sums (0 and 2). So, same parity. Therefore, maybe swapping is possible.But earlier attempts didn't find a sequence. Maybe I need to try again.Let me try with (0,0) and (1,1):1. Start at (0,0) and (1,1).2. Rotate (1,1) around (0,0) by 90 degrees. The new position is (0 - (1 - 0), 0 + (1 - 0)) = (-1,1). Wait, no, the rotation formula is (c - (y - d), d + (x - c)). So, rotating (1,1) around (0,0):x' = 0 - (1 - 0) = -1y' = 0 + (1 - 0) = 1So, new position is (-1,1). Now legs are at (0,0) and (-1,1).3. Now, rotate (0,0) around (-1,1). Let's compute the new position:x' = -1 - (0 - 1) = -1 - (-1) = 0y' = 1 + (0 - (-1)) = 1 + 1 = 2So, new position is (0,2). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (0,2).4. Rotate (0,2) around (-1,1):x' = -1 - (2 - 1) = -1 - 1 = -2y' = 1 + (0 - (-1)) = 1 + 1 = 2So, new position is (-2,2). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (-2,2).5. Rotate (-2,2) around (-1,1):x' = -1 - (2 - 1) = -1 -1 = -2y' = 1 + (-2 - (-1)) = 1 + (-1) = 0So, new position is (-2,0). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (-2,0).6. Rotate (-2,0) around (-1,1):x' = -1 - (0 - 1) = -1 - (-1) = 0y' = 1 + (-2 - (-1)) = 1 + (-1) = 0So, new position is (0,0). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (0,0).Wait, that's back to the original position but swapped? No, because one leg is at (-1,1) and the other at (0,0). Not swapped yet.Hmm, maybe I need a different sequence.Alternatively, let's try rotating in the other direction.1. Start at (0,0) and (1,1).2. Rotate (1,1) around (0,0) by -90 degrees (clockwise). The new position would be (1, -1). So, legs are at (0,0) and (1,-1).3. Rotate (0,0) around (1,-1):x' = 1 - (0 - (-1)) = 1 -1 = 0y' = -1 + (0 -1) = -1 -1 = -2So, new position is (0,-2). Legs are at (1,-1) and (0,-2).4. Rotate (0,-2) around (1,-1):x' = 1 - (-2 - (-1)) = 1 - (-1) = 2y' = -1 + (0 -1) = -1 -1 = -2So, new position is (2,-2). Legs are at (1,-1) and (2,-2).5. Rotate (2,-2) around (1,-1):x' = 1 - (-2 - (-1)) = 1 - (-1) = 2y' = -1 + (2 -1) = -1 +1 = 0So, new position is (2,0). Legs are at (1,-1) and (2,0).6. Rotate (2,0) around (1,-1):x' = 1 - (0 - (-1)) = 1 -1 = 0y' = -1 + (2 -1) = -1 +1 = 0So, new position is (0,0). Legs are at (1,-1) and (0,0).Again, back to the original position but not swapped.This is frustrating. Maybe there's a different approach. Perhaps using more than two legs? Wait, no, the compass only has two legs.Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the distance squared is 2, which is even, but the initial positions have the same parity, but still, swapping isn't possible. Or maybe it is possible with more steps.Wait, maybe I need to consider that each rotation can be by any angle, not just 90 degrees. Because the problem says \\"rotate it around one of the legs to move the other leg to another vertex.\\" So, the rotation doesn't have to be by 90 degrees; it can be any angle that lands the moving leg on another vertex.So, perhaps instead of rotating by 90 degrees, I can rotate by other angles to reach different points.For example, with the initial distance sqrt(2), rotating around (0,0) can move (1,1) to other points on the circle of radius sqrt(2). The possible integer points on this circle are (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1). So, only four points.Therefore, from (1,1), rotating around (0,0) can only move to those four points. Similarly, rotating around (1,1) can move (0,0) to other points on the circle of radius sqrt(2) centered at (1,1). The integer points on that circle would be (1+1,1), (1-1,1), (1,1+1), (1,1-1), which are (2,1), (0,1), (1,2), (1,0). So, those are the possible positions.Therefore, from (0,0) and (1,1), rotating around (1,1) can move (0,0) to (2,1), (0,1), (1,2), or (1,0).So, let's try:1. Start at (0,0) and (1,1).2. Rotate (0,0) around (1,1) to (2,1). Now legs are at (2,1) and (1,1).3. Rotate (1,1) around (2,1) to (2,0). Now legs are at (2,1) and (2,0).4. Rotate (2,1) around (2,0) to (1,0). Now legs are at (1,0) and (2,0).5. Rotate (2,0) around (1,0) to (1,1). Now legs are at (1,0) and (1,1).6. Rotate (1,0) around (1,1) to (0,1). Now legs are at (0,1) and (1,1).7. Rotate (1,1) around (0,1) to (0,0). Now legs are at (0,1) and (0,0).8. Rotate (0,0) around (0,1) to (1,1). Now legs are at (0,0) and (1,1).Again, back to the start. It seems like no matter how I rotate, I can't get the legs to swap positions. Maybe it's impossible for certain distances.Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the initial distance. It just says the legs are at vertices of the grid. So, maybe for some distances, it's possible, and for others, it's not.But the question is whether it's possible in a few steps, not necessarily for any initial configuration. So, perhaps if the initial distance allows for certain symmetries, swapping is possible.Alternatively, maybe the problem is always possible regardless of the initial distance, or maybe it's never possible.Wait, let's think about the general case. Suppose the compass has legs at points A and B, with distance d. We want to swap A and B.Each rotation around A moves B to another point B' such that AB' = AB = d. Similarly, rotating around B moves A to A' with BA' = d.So, the set of possible positions for B is the set of points at distance d from A, and similarly for A.To swap A and B, we need to find a sequence of points B1, B2, ..., Bn such that:- B0 = B- B1 is obtained by rotating B around A- B2 is obtained by rotating B1 around some other point (either A or another leg)- ...- Bn = ASimilarly, the same for A.But this seems like a graph problem where each node is a point, and edges connect points that are distance d apart. Then, swapping is equivalent to finding a path from B to A in this graph, with the constraint that each step must be a rotation around one of the current legs.Wait, but each step involves rotating one leg around the other, so the other leg must stay fixed during the rotation. Therefore, the movement is constrained to rotating one leg around the fixed one.Therefore, the problem is similar to moving in the graph where each move is a rotation around one of the current points, moving the other to another point at distance d.So, the question is whether there's a path from B to A in this graph, considering that each move must be a rotation around one of the current points.But in graph terms, this is like a Cayley graph where generators are the rotations around each point.But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach.Let me consider the concept of inversion. Inversion in geometry is a transformation that maps a point to another point such that the product of their distances from a fixed point is constant. But I don't know if that's applicable here.Alternatively, maybe using vectors. Let me denote the initial points as vectors **a** and **b**. The distance between them is |**b** - **a**| = d.When we rotate **b** around **a**, we're effectively adding a vector perpendicular to (**b** - **a**) with the same magnitude. So, the new position **b'** = **a** + e^{iθ}(**b** - **a**), where θ is the rotation angle.But since we're on a grid, the new position must have integer coordinates. Therefore, the rotation must result in a vector that, when added to **a**, gives integer coordinates.This implies that the rotation must be such that the resulting vector is another lattice point. Therefore, the angle θ must be such that the rotation matrix applied to (**b** - **a**) results in another integer vector.This is only possible if (**b** - **a**) is a vector that can be rotated by some angle to another integer vector of the same length.For example, if (**b** - **a**) is (1,1), rotating by 90 degrees gives (-1,1), which is another integer vector. Similarly, rotating (1,0) by 90 degrees gives (0,1).But if (**b** - **a**) is (1,2), rotating by 90 degrees would give (-2,1), which is still an integer vector. So, in that case, it's possible.Wait, but for any vector, rotating by 90 degrees will give another integer vector if the original vector has integer components. Because the rotation matrix for 90 degrees is [0, -1; 1, 0], which when applied to (a,b) gives (-b,a), which are integers if a and b are integers.Therefore, for any initial vector (**b** - **a**) with integer components, rotating by 90 degrees will give another integer vector of the same length. Similarly, rotating by 180, 270 degrees will also give integer vectors.Therefore, for any initial distance d = sqrt(a² + b²), we can rotate the other leg by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, etc., to reach other points.Therefore, the set of possible positions for the moving leg is the set of all points at distance d from the fixed leg, which are the integer points on the circle of radius d.Now, the question is whether we can move from B to A through such rotations.But since each rotation is a step that moves one leg to another point on the circle, and the other leg remains fixed, we can model this as a graph where each node is a point on the circle, and edges connect points that can be reached by a rotation around the other leg.Wait, but the other leg is fixed during the rotation, so the movement is constrained by the position of the other leg.This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of group theory or something.Alternatively, perhaps considering that each rotation is equivalent to adding a vector perpendicular to the current vector. So, starting from (**b** - **a**) = (a,b), rotating by 90 degrees gives (-b,a). Then, rotating again gives (-a,-b), then (b,-a), and back.Therefore, the possible positions are the four points obtained by rotating the original vector by multiples of 90 degrees.But if the original vector isn't aligned with the axes or diagonals, rotating by 90 degrees might not give integer points. Wait, no, as I thought earlier, rotating any integer vector by 90 degrees gives another integer vector.Wait, no, actually, if the vector is (a,b), rotating by 90 degrees gives (-b,a), which is integer if a and b are integers. So, yes, it's always possible.Therefore, for any initial vector, we can generate four points by rotating 90 degrees each time.But to swap the legs, we need to move from B to A, which is equivalent to moving from (**b**) to (**a**). Since (**a**) is the reflection of (**b**) over the midpoint, but I don't know if that helps.Wait, maybe if we can move B to A through a series of rotations, each time moving it closer.Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that we can move in steps that change the position by vectors that are perpendicular to the current vector.Wait, let's think about the midpoint. The midpoint M between A and B is ((a + c)/2, (b + d)/2), where A is (a,b) and B is (c,d). To swap A and B, we need to move A to B and B to A. But each rotation moves one leg around the other, so the midpoint might change.Wait, no, when you rotate one leg around the other, the midpoint doesn't necessarily stay the same. For example, rotating B around A by 90 degrees changes the midpoint.Therefore, the midpoint isn't preserved, so that approach might not help.Alternatively, maybe considering that each rotation is a kind of translation in the plane, but constrained to the circle.Wait, no, rotation is not translation. It's a circular movement.Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that any rotation can be decomposed into translations and reflections, but I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of permutations. Each rotation is a permutation of the possible positions of the legs. To swap them, we need a permutation that maps the initial configuration to the swapped one.But I'm not sure how to proceed with that.Alternatively, maybe considering that each rotation is an element of the orthogonal group, but restricted to integer coordinates.Wait, perhaps too abstract.Let me try a different approach. Suppose we have two points A and B. We want to move A to B and B to A.Each move consists of rotating one point around the other. So, each move is a rotation of 90 degrees, 180 degrees, etc., but constrained to land on integer coordinates.If we can perform a rotation that moves A to B, then we're done in one step. But that's only possible if B is on the circle centered at A with radius AB, which it is, but the rotation must land exactly on B. But unless the angle is 0 or 360, which doesn't change the position, or 180 degrees, which would move A to the diametrically opposite point.Wait, if we rotate A around B by 180 degrees, A will move to the point such that B is the midpoint between A and its new position. So, the new position A' would be (2b_x - a_x, 2b_y - a_y). Similarly, rotating B around A by 180 degrees moves B to (2a_x - b_x, 2a_y - b_y).Therefore, if we can perform a 180-degree rotation, we can move A to the reflection over B, and vice versa.But in that case, if we rotate A around B by 180 degrees, A moves to A', and then if we rotate A' around B by 180 degrees, A'' = A. So, it's an involution.But to swap A and B, we need to move A to B and B to A. So, if we can move A to B via a rotation, that would do it. But a rotation around B by some angle would move A to B only if B is on the circle centered at B with radius BA, which it is, but the angle required would be such that the rotation maps A to B.But the angle between BA and BB is zero, so that's trivial. Wait, no, rotating A around B by 0 degrees doesn't move it. Rotating by 180 degrees moves it to the reflection point.Therefore, unless A and B are aligned in such a way that a rotation by some angle around B maps A to B, which would require that the angle between BA and BB is such that the rotation achieves that.But since we're on a grid, the only possible angles that result in integer coordinates are those that correspond to Pythagorean triples, I think.Wait, perhaps if the vector from B to A is such that rotating it by some angle gives the vector from B to B, which is zero. That doesn't make sense.Alternatively, maybe if the vector BA is such that rotating it by some angle gives the vector BB, which is zero. That's not possible unless BA is zero, which it isn't.Therefore, perhaps it's impossible to move A to B via a single rotation around B, unless A is already at B.Therefore, maybe we need multiple rotations.Wait, but each rotation can only move one leg at a time, and the other remains fixed. So, to move A to B, we need to perform a series of rotations that effectively translate A towards B, but each step is a rotation around the other leg.But translation isn't directly possible with rotations. However, a combination of rotations can simulate translation.Wait, in geometry, two rotations can result in a translation. Specifically, rotating a point around one center, then rotating the result around another center can result in a translation if the two centers are aligned appropriately.But in our case, each rotation must be around one of the current legs, which are moving. So, it's not a fixed center.Alternatively, maybe using the fact that two rotations can result in a translation. Let me recall: if you rotate a point around A by θ, then rotate the result around B by -θ, the net effect is a translation by a vector dependent on θ and the distance between A and B.But in our case, the rotations are constrained to keep the distance between the legs constant. So, each rotation is around one leg, moving the other leg to another point at the same distance.Therefore, the distance between the legs remains the same after each rotation.Therefore, the set of possible configurations is constrained to pairs of points at distance d apart.Therefore, to swap A and B, we need to find a path from (A,B) to (B,A) through such rotations.But in the graph of configurations, each node is a pair of points at distance d, and edges correspond to rotating one point around the other.So, the question is whether (B,A) is reachable from (A,B) in this graph.But since each rotation is invertible (rotating back by the same angle), the graph is undirected. Therefore, if there's a path from (A,B) to (B,A), it's symmetric.But whether such a path exists depends on the properties of the graph.Alternatively, maybe considering that the group generated by these rotations acts transitively on the set of pairs of points at distance d. If that's the case, then swapping is possible.But I'm not sure about that.Wait, let's consider the case where d = sqrt(2). The possible pairs are points like (0,0) and (1,1), (1,0) and (0,1), etc. Can we move from (0,0),(1,1) to (1,1),(0,0)?As I tried earlier, it seems difficult, but maybe with more steps.Alternatively, maybe it's impossible because of some invariant.Wait, earlier I thought about the parity of the sum of coordinates. Let's revisit that.If the initial points have sums of coordinates with different parities, swapping is impossible. But if they have the same parity, maybe it's possible.But in the case of (0,0) and (1,1), both have even sums (0 and 2). So, same parity. Therefore, swapping should be possible.But my earlier attempts didn't find a sequence. Maybe I need to try a different approach.Wait, perhaps using more than two legs? No, the compass only has two legs.Alternatively, maybe using the fact that rotating around a point can move the other leg to a position that allows further rotations.Wait, let's try again with (0,0) and (1,1):1. Start at (0,0) and (1,1).2. Rotate (1,1) around (0,0) by 90 degrees to (-1,1). Now legs are at (0,0) and (-1,1).3. Rotate (0,0) around (-1,1) by 90 degrees. The new position is (-1 - (0 - 1), 1 + (0 - (-1))) = (-1 - (-1), 1 +1) = (0,2). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (0,2).4. Rotate (0,2) around (-1,1) by 90 degrees. The new position is (-1 - (2 -1), 1 + (0 - (-1))) = (-1 -1, 1 +1) = (-2,2). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (-2,2).5. Rotate (-2,2) around (-1,1) by 90 degrees. The new position is (-1 - (2 -1), 1 + (-2 - (-1))) = (-1 -1, 1 + (-1)) = (-2,0). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (-2,0).6. Rotate (-2,0) around (-1,1) by 90 degrees. The new position is (-1 - (0 -1), 1 + (-2 - (-1))) = (-1 - (-1), 1 + (-1)) = (0,0). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (0,0).Still not swapped. Maybe I need to rotate in the other direction.Alternatively, let's try rotating (0,0) around (1,1) to (2,1):1. Start at (0,0) and (1,1).2. Rotate (0,0) around (1,1) by 90 degrees. The new position is (1 - (0 -1), 1 + (0 -1)) = (2,0). Wait, no, the rotation formula is (c - (y - d), d + (x - c)). So, rotating (0,0) around (1,1):x' = 1 - (0 -1) = 1 - (-1) = 2y' = 1 + (0 -1) = 1 -1 = 0So, new position is (2,0). Now legs are at (2,0) and (1,1).3. Rotate (1,1) around (2,0) by 90 degrees. The new position is (2 - (1 -0), 0 + (1 -2)) = (2 -1, 0 -1) = (1,-1). Now legs are at (2,0) and (1,-1).4. Rotate (2,0) around (1,-1) by 90 degrees. The new position is (1 - (0 - (-1)), -1 + (2 -1)) = (1 -1, -1 +1) = (0,0). Now legs are at (1,-1) and (0,0).Again, back to the start but not swapped.This is really challenging. Maybe I need to consider that swapping is impossible for certain distances.Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the initial distance. It just says the legs are at vertices. So, maybe for some distances, it's possible, and for others, it's not.But the question is whether it's possible in a few steps, not necessarily for all initial configurations. So, perhaps if the initial distance is such that the legs can be swapped, then yes.But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is yes, it's possible, but I can't figure out the exact sequence.Alternatively, maybe the answer is no, it's impossible, because of the parity argument.Wait, earlier I thought that if the sums of the coordinates have different parities, swapping is impossible. But if they have the same parity, maybe it's possible.But in the case of (0,0) and (1,1), same parity, but I couldn't find a sequence. Maybe it's still impossible.Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the distance squared is even, so the coordinates must always have the same parity, making swapping impossible because you can't reach the other point with the same parity in some cases.Wait, no, in the case of (0,0) and (1,1), both have even sums, but I can't reach (1,1) from (0,0) through rotations. Or can I?Wait, actually, in the first step, rotating (1,1) around (0,0) by 90 degrees gives (-1,1), which is a different point. But to get to (0,0), I need to rotate (-1,1) around some point.Wait, maybe if I rotate (-1,1) around (0,0) by 180 degrees, it would go to (1,-1). Then, rotating (1,-1) around (0,0) by 180 degrees again would bring it back to (-1,1). Not helpful.Alternatively, rotating (-1,1) around (1,1) by 180 degrees would move it to (3,1). Then, rotating (3,1) around (1,1) by 180 degrees would bring it back to (-1,1). Not helpful.This is getting me nowhere. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, perhaps considering that each rotation is a kind of reflection. If I rotate a point 180 degrees around another point, it's equivalent to reflecting it over that point.So, rotating A around B by 180 degrees reflects A over B to A'. Similarly, rotating B around A' by 180 degrees would reflect B over A' to B', which might be A.Wait, let's try:1. Start at (0,0) and (1,1).2. Rotate (0,0) around (1,1) by 180 degrees. The new position is (2*1 -0, 2*1 -0) = (2,2). Now legs are at (2,2) and (1,1).3. Rotate (1,1) around (2,2) by 180 degrees. The new position is (2*2 -1, 2*2 -1) = (3,3). Now legs are at (2,2) and (3,3).4. Rotate (3,3) around (2,2) by 180 degrees. The new position is (1,1). Now legs are at (2,2) and (1,1).5. Rotate (1,1) around (2,2) by 180 degrees. The new position is (3,3). Now legs are at (2,2) and (3,3).This isn't helping. Maybe I need to rotate by different angles.Wait, maybe if I rotate by 90 degrees and then 270 degrees, I can achieve a translation.Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that two rotations can result in a translation. Let me recall: rotating a point around A by θ, then rotating the result around B by -θ results in a translation by a vector dependent on θ and the distance between A and B.But in our case, the distance between A and B is fixed, so maybe we can use this to translate one leg towards the other.Wait, let's try:1. Start at (0,0) and (1,1).2. Rotate (1,1) around (0,0) by 90 degrees to (-1,1). Now legs are at (0,0) and (-1,1).3. Rotate (0,0) around (-1,1) by -90 degrees. The new position is (-1 - (0 -1), 1 + (0 - (-1))) = (-1 - (-1), 1 +1) = (0,2). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (0,2).4. Rotate (0,2) around (-1,1) by 90 degrees. The new position is (-1 - (2 -1), 1 + (0 - (-1))) = (-1 -1, 1 +1) = (-2,2). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (-2,2).5. Rotate (-2,2) around (-1,1) by -90 degrees. The new position is (-1 - (2 -1), 1 + (-2 - (-1))) = (-1 -1, 1 + (-1)) = (-2,0). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (-2,0).6. Rotate (-2,0) around (-1,1) by 90 degrees. The new position is (-1 - (0 -1), 1 + (-2 - (-1))) = (-1 - (-1), 1 + (-1)) = (0,0). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (0,0).Still not swapped. I'm stuck in a loop.Maybe the conclusion is that it's impossible to swap the legs because of the parity argument. If the initial points have different parity sums, it's impossible. If they have the same parity, maybe it's still impossible because of some other invariant.Alternatively, maybe it's always possible because the group generated by the rotations is large enough.Wait, but in the examples I tried, it's not possible. So, maybe the answer is no, it's not possible to swap the legs.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about the problem differently.Wait, another approach: consider the coordinates modulo 2. Each rotation around a point will change the coordinates in a certain way modulo 2.If the initial points are (0,0) and (1,1), their coordinates modulo 2 are (0,0) and (1,1). After any rotation, the moving point's coordinates modulo 2 will change based on the rotation.But since the rotation is by 90 degrees, which swaps coordinates and changes signs, the parity (mod 2) of the coordinates will change.Wait, let's see:Rotating (x,y) around (c,d) by 90 degrees gives (c - (y - d), d + (x - c)).Modulo 2, this becomes (c - (y - d) mod 2, d + (x - c) mod 2).But since c and d are fixed during the rotation, their parities are fixed. Therefore, the change in the moving point's coordinates modulo 2 depends on the rotation.But I'm not sure if this helps.Alternatively, maybe considering that each rotation changes the position in such a way that the parity of the coordinates alternates.But I'm not making progress here.Wait, maybe the key is that the set of possible positions for each leg is limited by the circle, and the only way to swap is if the circle has certain symmetries.For example, if the circle has fourfold symmetry, like radius sqrt(2), then swapping might be possible by rotating 90 degrees twice.But in practice, as I saw earlier, it's not working.Alternatively, maybe the answer is yes, it's possible, because you can always perform a series of rotations to move one leg to the other's position, but I can't find the exact steps.Wait, maybe I need to consider that after several rotations, the legs can be moved to any position on the circle, and thus, swapping is possible.But in my attempts, I couldn't find a sequence, so maybe it's not possible.Alternatively, maybe the answer is yes, it's possible, because the group of rotations is rich enough to allow any permutation of the points on the circle.But I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: if the distance squared is a sum of two squares in more than one way, then there are multiple points on the circle, allowing for more flexibility.For example, distance squared 25 can be expressed as 3² + 4² or 5² + 0², so there are more points on the circle, allowing for more movement.But in the case of distance squared 2, it's only 1² +1², so fewer points.Therefore, maybe for distances that can be expressed as sums of squares in multiple ways, swapping is possible, but for others, it's not.But the problem doesn't specify the initial distance, so maybe the answer is yes, it's possible for some distances, but not for others.But the question is whether it's possible in a few steps, not necessarily for all distances.Wait, the problem says \\"It is permissible to, without changing the compass's radius, rotate it around one of the legs to move the other leg to another vertex on the sheet. Is it possible, in a few such steps, to switch the positions of the compass's legs?\\"So, it's asking whether it's possible in general, not for a specific initial distance.Therefore, maybe the answer is yes, it's possible, because for any distance, you can perform rotations to swap the legs.But my earlier attempts with specific distances didn't find a sequence, so maybe the answer is no.Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe if I rotate around different legs alternately, I can achieve the swap.Wait, let's try again with (0,0) and (1,1):1. Start at (0,0) and (1,1).2. Rotate (1,1) around (0,0) by 90 degrees to (-1,1). Now legs are at (0,0) and (-1,1).3. Rotate (0,0) around (-1,1) by 90 degrees to (0,2). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (0,2).4. Rotate (0,2) around (-1,1) by 90 degrees to (-2,2). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (-2,2).5. Rotate (-2,2) around (-1,1) by 90 degrees to (-2,0). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (-2,0).6. Rotate (-2,0) around (-1,1) by 90 degrees to (0,0). Now legs are at (-1,1) and (0,0).Still not swapped. Maybe I need to rotate in the other direction.Alternatively, let's try:1. Start at (0,0) and (1,1).2. Rotate (0,0) around (1,1) by 90 degrees to (2,0). Now legs are at (2,0) and (1,1).3. Rotate (1,1) around (2,0) by 90 degrees to (1,-1). Now legs are at (2,0) and (1,-1).4. Rotate (2,0) around (1,-1) by 90 degrees to (0,0). Now legs are at (1,-1) and (0,0).Again, back to the start.I'm starting to think that it's impossible to swap the legs because of some invariant, like the parity of the coordinates or the distance squared.Therefore, the answer might be no, it's not possible to swap the legs in a few steps.But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to look for a mathematical proof.Wait, I recall that in such problems, sometimes the key is that the set of reachable points forms a group under addition, and swapping requires certain conditions.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps considering that each rotation preserves the determinant of the vector between the legs. The determinant is the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors, which is preserved under rotation.But since we're on a grid, the determinant must be an integer. Therefore, the area is preserved.But swapping the legs would change the orientation, but not the area. So, that might not be an issue.Wait, but the determinant is preserved under rotation, so if the initial determinant is non-zero, it remains non-zero. But swapping doesn't change the determinant, so that's not an obstruction.Hmm.Alternatively, maybe considering that the set of possible positions forms a lattice, and swapping requires moving along that lattice.But I'm not making progress.Given that I've tried several sequences without success, and considering the parity argument, I'm inclined to think that it's impossible to swap the legs if their initial positions have different parity sums, and possible otherwise.But since the problem doesn't specify the initial positions, maybe the answer is that it's not always possible, but sometimes it is.But the question is whether it's possible in a few steps, not necessarily for all cases.Wait, the problem says \\"It is permissible to... Is it possible, in a few such steps, to switch the positions of the compass's legs?\\"So, it's asking whether it's possible in general, not necessarily for all initial positions. So, maybe the answer is yes, it's possible, because for some initial positions, you can swap them.But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is no, because of the parity argument.Wait, if the initial positions have different parity sums, it's impossible. If they have the same, maybe it's possible.But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the answer is no, it's not always possible.But the question is whether it's possible in a few steps, not whether it's always possible.Therefore, the answer is yes, it's possible for some initial positions, but not for others.But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the answer is yes, it's possible.Wait, but in my attempts, I couldn't find a sequence for (0,0) and (1,1), which have the same parity. So, maybe it's not possible even for same parity.Therefore, the answer might be no, it's impossible.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to conclude based on the parity argument.If the initial points have different parity sums, swapping is impossible. If they have the same, maybe it's possible.But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the answer is no, it's not possible in general.But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is yes, it's possible.Wait, I think I need to look for a mathematical result. I recall that on the integer lattice, the set of points reachable by rotations is limited by the parity and the distance.Therefore, if the initial points have the same parity, it's possible to swap them, otherwise not.But in my attempts, I couldn't find a sequence for same parity, so maybe it's still impossible.Alternatively, maybe the answer is yes, it's possible, because you can always perform a series of rotations to swap the legs.But I'm not sure.Given that I've spent a lot of time on this and can't find a sequence, I think the answer is no, it's not possible to swap the legs in a few steps.But I'm not entirely confident. Maybe the answer is yes, it's possible.Wait, I think I need to conclude. Based on the parity argument, if the initial points have different parity sums, swapping is impossible. If they have the same, maybe it's possible.But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the answer is yes, it's possible.But I'm not sure. I think the answer is no, it's not possible.Wait, no, I think the answer is yes, it's possible. Because you can always perform a series of rotations to move one leg to the other's position.But I can't find the exact steps, so I'm not sure.Wait, maybe the answer is yes, it's possible, because you can rotate one leg around the other to move it to the desired position.But in my attempts, I couldn't find a sequence, so maybe it's not possible.I think I need to conclude. Based on the parity argument, if the initial points have different parity sums, swapping is impossible. If they have the same, maybe it's possible.But since the problem doesn't specify, I think the answer is no, it's not possible in general.But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is yes, it's possible.Wait, I think I need to look for a different approach. Maybe considering that each rotation is a kind of reflection, and two reflections can make a translation.Wait, if I rotate A around B by 180 degrees, then rotate B around the new position of A by 180 degrees, I might achieve a translation.Let me try:1. Start at (0,0) and (1,1).2. Rotate (0,0) around (1,1) by 180 degrees to (2,2). Now legs are at (2,2) and (1,1).3. Rotate (1,1) around (2,2) by 180 degrees to (3,3). Now legs are at (2,2) and (3,3).4. Rotate (3,3) around (2,2) by 180 degrees to (1,1). Now legs are at (2,2) and (1,1).5. Rotate (1,1) around (2,2) by 180 degrees to (3,3). Now legs are at (2,2) and (3,3).This isn't helping. I'm stuck in a loop again.I think I've tried all possible approaches and can't find a way to swap the legs. Therefore, I conclude that it's impossible to swap the legs in a few steps."},{"question":"A retired history teacher, Mr. Patel, is volunteering to document the oral history of local gharanas.

If Mr. Patel wants to conduct and transcribe a total of 8 interviews in a week, set up and solve a system of equations to determine how many interviews he can conduct and transcribe in the available hours. 2. If Mr. Patel decides to reduce the transcription time by recording only key parts of each interview, thus reducing the transcription time to 2 hours per interview, determine the maximum number of interviews he can conduct and transcribe in a week given the same total time constraint.","answer":"First, I need to determine how many interviews Mr. Patel can conduct and transcribe within his 30-hour weekly limit. Each interview requires 2 hours for conducting and 3 hours for transcribing, totaling 5 hours per interview.To find out how many interviews he can handle, I'll set up an equation where the total time spent on interviews equals 30 hours. Let ( x ) represent the number of interviews. The equation will be:5x = 30Solving for ( x ), I divide both sides by 5:x = 6This means Mr. Patel can conduct and transcribe 6 interviews in a week.Next, if Mr. Patel reduces the transcription time to 2 hours per interview, the total time per interview becomes 4 hours (2 hours for conducting and 2 hours for transcribing).

According to the problem, the height is 3 feet less than twice the width, so the height can be expressed as ( 2w - 3 ) feet.Next, I'll set up the equation for the area of the banner. The area is given by the product of the width and height, which equals 180 square feet. This gives me the equation:[w(2w - 3) = 180]Expanding and rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation:[2w^2 - 3w - 180 = 0]I'll solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:[w = frac{3 pm sqrt{9 + 1440}}{4} = frac{3 pm sqrt{1449}}{4}]Since the width must be a positive value, I'll take the positive root:[w = frac{3 + sqrt{1449}}{4}]Once the width is determined, the height can be calculated using the expression ( 2w - 3 ).For the second part, I'll let ( x ) represent the width of the border. The new dimensions of the banner including the border will be ( w + 2x ) for the width and ( 2w - 3 + 2x ) for the height.

Given that the function y = 2^{|x|} has a domain of [a, b] and a range of [1, 2], the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the length of the interval [a, b] is","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given the function y = 2^{|x|}, and it's defined on an interval [a, b] with a domain [a, b] and a range [1, 2]. I need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum possible lengths of the interval [a, b]. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me recall what the function y = 2^{|x|} looks like. Since it's an exponential function with the absolute value of x in the exponent, it's symmetric about the y-axis. That means it's the same on both sides of the y-axis. So, for positive x, it's just y = 2^x, which is an increasing function, and for negative x, it's y = 2^{-x}, which is a decreasing function towards 0 as x becomes more negative.Now, the range of the function is given as [1, 2]. So, the smallest value y can take is 1, and the largest is 2. Let me figure out what x-values correspond to these y-values.Starting with y = 1: 2^{|x|} = 1. Since 2^0 = 1, this implies |x| = 0, so x = 0. So, the point (0, 1) is on the graph.Next, y = 2: 2^{|x|} = 2. Since 2^1 = 2, this implies |x| = 1, so x = 1 or x = -1. So, the points (1, 2) and (-1, 2) are on the graph.So, if I consider the function y = 2^{|x|}, it's symmetric, and it has a minimum at x = 0 with y = 1, and it increases to y = 2 at x = 1 and x = -1.Now, the problem says that the domain is [a, b], and the range is [1, 2]. So, the function must map the interval [a, b] onto [1, 2]. I need to find all possible intervals [a, b] such that when I plug in x from [a, b] into y = 2^{|x|}, the outputs cover exactly [1, 2].But wait, the function y = 2^{|x|} is not one-to-one over all real numbers because it's symmetric. So, depending on the interval [a, b], the function could be increasing, decreasing, or both.Let me think about this. Since the function has a minimum at x = 0, if the interval [a, b] includes 0, then the function will decrease from a to 0 and then increase from 0 to b. If the interval doesn't include 0, then it's either entirely on the left side (negative x) or entirely on the right side (positive x).But since the range is [1, 2], which includes the minimum value 1, the interval [a, b] must include x = 0 because that's where the function attains its minimum. Otherwise, if the interval is entirely on one side of 0, the function would have a higher minimum.Wait, let me verify that. If I take an interval on the right side, say [c, d] where c > 0, then the minimum value of y would be at x = c, which is 2^{c}, and since c > 0, 2^{c} > 1. Similarly, on the left side, if I take an interval [c, d] where c < 0 and d < 0, the minimum value would be at x = d (since it's decreasing as x becomes more negative), which is 2^{|d|} = 2^{-d}, and since d < 0, -d > 0, so 2^{-d} > 1. Therefore, to have the minimum value of y as 1, the interval [a, b] must include x = 0.Therefore, the interval [a, b] must include 0, and the function will attain its minimum at x = 0, which is y = 1, and the maximum at either x = a or x = b, depending on how far a and b are from 0.But wait, actually, since the function is symmetric, if I include both sides, the maximum y-value will be at the point farthest from 0, either a or b. So, if a is negative and b is positive, then the maximum y-value will be the larger of 2^{|a|} and 2^{|b|}. Since the range is [1, 2], the maximum y-value is 2, so either |a| or |b| must be 1.So, let me formalize this. The interval [a, b] must include 0, so a ≤ 0 ≤ b. The function y = 2^{|x|} on [a, b] will have its minimum at x = 0, which is y = 1, and the maximum at either x = a or x = b, whichever is farther from 0.Since the maximum y-value is 2, we have 2^{|a|} = 2 or 2^{|b|} = 2. Therefore, |a| = 1 or |b| = 1. But since a ≤ 0 ≤ b, |a| = -a and |b| = b. So, either -a = 1 or b = 1.Therefore, either a = -1 or b = 1.So, there are two cases:1. The interval [a, b] includes -1 and 1, so a = -1 and b = 1. Then, the length of the interval is 1 - (-1) = 2.2. The interval [a, b] is such that either a = -1 and b is greater than 0 but less than 1, or b = 1 and a is less than 0 but greater than -1.Wait, no. Let me think again. If the interval [a, b] must include 0, and to have the maximum y-value as 2, either a must be -1 or b must be 1. So, the interval can be either [-1, b] where b is between 0 and 1, or [a, 1] where a is between -1 and 0.Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think.If we fix a = -1, then b can be any number greater than or equal to 0, but since the maximum y-value is 2, which is already achieved at x = -1, then b can be any number up to 1 because beyond x = 1, the function would start increasing again, but wait, no, on the right side, the function is increasing as x increases.Wait, no, if a = -1, then the function at x = -1 is 2, and as x increases from -1 to 0, the function decreases to 1, and then increases again from 1 to 2 as x goes from 0 to 1. So, if I take the interval [-1, b], where b is between 0 and 1, the function's maximum is still 2 at x = -1, and the minimum is 1 at x = 0. Similarly, if I take the interval [a, 1], where a is between -1 and 0, the function's maximum is 2 at x = 1, and the minimum is 1 at x = 0.But wait, if I take a larger interval beyond [-1, 1], say [-1, c] where c > 1, then the function at x = c would be 2^{c}, which is greater than 2, which would make the range exceed [1, 2], which is not allowed. Similarly, if I take a < -1, then 2^{|a|} = 2^{-a}, which would be greater than 2, again exceeding the range.Therefore, the interval [a, b] must be such that the maximum |x| is 1, so either a = -1 or b = 1, but not both necessarily.Wait, but if I take a = -1 and b = 1, then the interval is [-1, 1], which has length 2, and the function's range is [1, 2], which is exactly what we need.Alternatively, if I take a = -1 and b somewhere between 0 and 1, then the interval is [-1, b], with length b - (-1) = b + 1. The maximum y-value is still 2 at x = -1, and the minimum is 1 at x = 0. Similarly, if I take a somewhere between -1 and 0, and b = 1, then the interval is [a, 1], with length 1 - a. The maximum y-value is 2 at x = 1, and the minimum is 1 at x = 0.So, in these cases, the length of the interval can vary depending on where a or b is placed.So, let's consider two cases:Case 1: a = -1, and b varies between 0 and 1.In this case, the interval is [-1, b], and the length is b - (-1) = b + 1. Since b can be as small as 0 (giving length 1) and as large as 1 (giving length 2). So, the length varies from 1 to 2.Case 2: b = 1, and a varies between -1 and 0.In this case, the interval is [a, 1], and the length is 1 - a. Since a can be as small as -1 (giving length 2) and as large as 0 (giving length 1). So, the length varies from 1 to 2.So, in both cases, the length can vary between 1 and 2. Therefore, the minimum possible length is 1, and the maximum possible length is 2. So, the difference between the maximum and minimum lengths is 2 - 1 = 1.Wait, but hold on. Is that all? Or are there other intervals where the function's range is [1, 2]?Wait, another thought: what if the interval [a, b] is entirely on one side of 0, but still includes 0? Wait, no, if it's entirely on one side, it can't include 0. So, that's not possible.Alternatively, could the interval be such that both a and b are on one side of 0, but still the range is [1, 2]? For example, if I take a = 0 and b = 1, then the function on [0, 1] is y = 2^x, which goes from 1 to 2, so the range is [1, 2]. Similarly, if I take a = -1 and b = 0, the function on [-1, 0] is y = 2^{-x}, which goes from 2 to 1, so the range is [1, 2].Wait, so in these cases, the interval is either [0, 1] or [-1, 0], each of length 1. So, that's another way to get the range [1, 2] with an interval of length 1.But wait, earlier I thought that the interval must include 0 to have the minimum value 1, but in these cases, the interval is either [0, 1] or [-1, 0], which do include 0 in the case of [-1, 0] and [0, 1], but actually, [0, 1] doesn't include negative numbers, but it still includes 0, so the minimum is at 0, which is 1.Wait, but in the case of [0, 1], the function is increasing from 1 to 2, so the range is [1, 2]. Similarly, in the case of [-1, 0], the function is decreasing from 2 to 1, so the range is [1, 2].So, in these cases, the interval is of length 1, and the range is [1, 2]. So, that's another possibility.So, in addition to the intervals where a = -1 and b varies between 0 and 1, or b = 1 and a varies between -1 and 0, we also have the intervals [0, 1] and [-1, 0], each of length 1.Wait, but actually, [0, 1] is a special case of the interval [a, 1] where a = 0, and [-1, 0] is a special case of the interval [-1, b] where b = 0.So, in that sense, the lengths can vary from 1 to 2.But hold on, if I take a = -1 and b = 1, the interval is [-1, 1], which has length 2, and the range is [1, 2]. Similarly, if I take a = -1 and b = 0, the interval is [-1, 0], which has length 1, and the range is [1, 2]. Similarly, if I take a = 0 and b = 1, the interval is [0, 1], which has length 1, and the range is [1, 2].So, the possible lengths of the interval [a, b] are from 1 to 2. Therefore, the minimum length is 1, the maximum length is 2, and the difference is 1.Wait, but hold on, is there a way to get a longer interval? For example, if I take a = -1 and b = something greater than 1, but then the function at b would be greater than 2, which would make the range exceed [1, 2]. Similarly, if I take a less than -1, then at a, the function would be greater than 2, which is not allowed. So, the maximum possible interval is [-1, 1], which has length 2.Similarly, the minimum interval is either [-1, 0] or [0, 1], each of length 1.Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum lengths is 2 - 1 = 1.Wait, but let me double-check. Is there any other interval where the function's range is [1, 2] with a different length?Suppose I take an interval that is not symmetric around 0. For example, let's say a = -0.5 and b = 1. Then, the function on [-0.5, 1] would have a minimum at x = 0, which is 1, and the maximum at x = 1, which is 2. So, the range is [1, 2], and the length is 1 - (-0.5) = 1.5. So, that's another interval with length 1.5.Similarly, if I take a = -1 and b = 0.5, the function on [-1, 0.5] would have a minimum at x = 0, which is 1, and the maximum at x = -1, which is 2. So, the range is [1, 2], and the length is 0.5 - (-1) = 1.5.So, in these cases, the length is 1.5, which is between 1 and 2.So, in fact, the length can take any value between 1 and 2, depending on how we choose a and b. So, the minimum length is 1, the maximum length is 2, and the difference is 1.Therefore, the answer should be 1.Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a way to get a longer interval than 2? For example, if I take a = -1 and b = 2, then the function at x = 2 is 4, which is outside the range [1, 2]. So, that's not allowed. Similarly, taking a = -2 and b = 1, the function at x = -2 is 4, which is too big. So, the maximum length is indeed 2.Similarly, the minimum length is 1, as in the intervals [0, 1] and [-1, 0].Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum lengths is 2 - 1 = 1.So, I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The difference between the maximum and minimum values of the length of the interval [a, b] is boxed{1}."},{"question":"In the aftermath of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima, a hibakusha is documenting the regrowth of a particular tree species that survived the blast.

The area of the rectangle is 128 square units, so half of that is 64 square units. Using the area formula for an equilateral triangle, ( frac{sqrt{3}}{4}x^2 = 64 ), I solve for ( x^2 ) by multiplying both sides by ( frac{4}{sqrt{3}} ), resulting in ( x^2 = frac{256}{sqrt{3}} ). Taking the square root of both sides gives ( x = frac{16}{3^{1/4}} ) units."},{"question":"The function y=f(x) satisfies f(x+2)=f(-x) for any x in mathbb{R}, and the graph of y=f(x-1) is symmetric about the point (1,0). If f(1)=4, find the value of f(2016)+f(2017)+f(2018).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about a function ( y = f(x) ) with some symmetries, and I need to find the sum ( f(2016) + f(2017) + f(2018) ). Let me try to unpack the given information step by step.First, the problem states that ( f(x + 2) = f(-x) ) for any real number ( x ). Hmm, that seems like a functional equation that relates the value of the function at ( x + 2 ) to its value at ( -x ). Maybe this implies some kind of periodicity or symmetry in the function. Let me write that down:1. ( f(x + 2) = f(-x) ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ).Next, it says that the graph of ( y = f(x - 1) ) is symmetric about the point ( (1, 0) ). Symmetry about a point usually means that the function is odd with respect to that point. In other words, for any point ( (a, b) ) on the graph, the point ( (2h - a, 2k - b) ) is also on the graph, where ( (h, k) ) is the center of symmetry. Here, the center is ( (1, 0) ), so for any ( x ), the point ( (x, f(x - 1)) ) implies that ( (2*1 - x, 2*0 - f(x - 1)) = (2 - x, -f(x - 1)) ) is also on the graph. Therefore, ( f((2 - x) - 1) = -f(x - 1) ), which simplifies to ( f(1 - x) = -f(x - 1) ). Let me write that as another equation:2. ( f(1 - x) = -f(x - 1) ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ).Also, we are given that ( f(1) = 4 ). So, ( f(1) = 4 ).Our goal is to find ( f(2016) + f(2017) + f(2018) ). That seems pretty far out, so maybe there's a periodicity or some repeating pattern in the function that can help us find these values without knowing the entire function.Let me try to analyze the given functional equations.Starting with equation 1: ( f(x + 2) = f(-x) ). Let me substitute ( x ) with ( x - 2 ) to see if I can find another relation. So, replacing ( x ) with ( x - 2 ), we get:( f((x - 2) + 2) = f(-(x - 2)) )Simplifying:( f(x) = f(-x + 2) )So, equation 1 can also be written as:( f(x) = f(2 - x) ) for all ( x ).That's interesting. So, the function is symmetric about the line ( x = 1 ), because ( f(x) = f(2 - x) ) implies reflection over ( x = 1 ).Now, equation 2 is ( f(1 - x) = -f(x - 1) ). Let me see if I can relate this to equation 1.Let me substitute ( x ) with ( 1 - x ) in equation 1. So, equation 1 becomes:( f(1 - x) = f(2 - (1 - x)) = f(1 + x) )So, from equation 1, ( f(1 - x) = f(1 + x) ).But from equation 2, ( f(1 - x) = -f(x - 1) ). Therefore, combining these two results:( f(1 + x) = -f(x - 1) )Let me write that as equation 3:3. ( f(1 + x) = -f(x - 1) ) for all ( x ).Hmm, equation 3 seems to relate the function's value at ( x + 1 ) to its value at ( x - 1 ) with a negative sign. Maybe this suggests some periodic behavior.Let me try to find a recurrence relation or a periodicity. Let's see.From equation 3, ( f(1 + x) = -f(x - 1) ). Let me replace ( x ) with ( x + 1 ) in equation 3 to see what happens:( f(1 + (x + 1)) = -f((x + 1) - 1) )Simplifying:( f(x + 2) = -f(x) )Wait, that's interesting. So, equation 3 leads us to:4. ( f(x + 2) = -f(x) ) for all ( x ).But from equation 1, we also have ( f(x + 2) = f(-x) ). Therefore, combining equations 1 and 4:( f(-x) = -f(x) )So, ( f(-x) = -f(x) ). That means the function ( f ) is odd about the origin. So, ( f ) is an odd function.Wait, but earlier we had from equation 1 that ( f(x) = f(2 - x) ), which suggests symmetry about ( x = 1 ), and now we have that ( f ) is odd. Let me see if these two can coexist.So, ( f(x) = f(2 - x) ) and ( f(-x) = -f(x) ). Let me substitute ( x ) with ( 2 - x ) in the oddness equation.So, ( f(-(2 - x)) = -f(2 - x) )Simplify:( f(x - 2) = -f(2 - x) )But from equation 1, ( f(2 - x) = f(x) ), so:( f(x - 2) = -f(x) )So, ( f(x - 2) = -f(x) ). Let me write that as equation 5:5. ( f(x - 2) = -f(x) ) for all ( x ).Alternatively, replacing ( x ) with ( x + 2 ), equation 5 becomes:( f(x) = -f(x + 2) )Which is consistent with equation 4, since equation 4 says ( f(x + 2) = -f(x) ), so ( f(x) = -f(x + 2) ) is the same as equation 4.So, from equation 4 and 5, we know that shifting the argument by 2 flips the sign of the function. So, ( f(x + 2) = -f(x) ). Therefore, shifting by 4 would flip the sign twice, bringing us back to the original value. Let me check:( f(x + 4) = f((x + 2) + 2) = -f(x + 2) = -(-f(x)) = f(x) )So, ( f(x + 4) = f(x) ). Therefore, the function ( f ) is periodic with period 4. That's a key insight.So, the function has period 4. Therefore, ( f(x + 4) = f(x) ) for all ( x ). So, to find ( f(2016) ), ( f(2017) ), and ( f(2018) ), we can reduce these arguments modulo 4.Let me compute each:2016 divided by 4: 2016 / 4 = 504, so 2016 is a multiple of 4, so 2016 mod 4 is 0. Therefore, ( f(2016) = f(0) ).2017 divided by 4: 2017 = 4*504 + 1, so 2017 mod 4 is 1. Therefore, ( f(2017) = f(1) = 4 ).2018 divided by 4: 2018 = 4*504 + 2, so 2018 mod 4 is 2. Therefore, ( f(2018) = f(2) ).So, now, we need to find ( f(0) ) and ( f(2) ).Let me see if I can find these values using the given information.We know that ( f(1) = 4 ). Let's see if we can find ( f(0) ) and ( f(2) ).From equation 1: ( f(x + 2) = f(-x) ). Let me set ( x = 0 ):( f(0 + 2) = f(-0) ) => ( f(2) = f(0) ).So, ( f(2) = f(0) ). Therefore, ( f(2018) = f(2) = f(0) ).So, now, we need to find ( f(0) ).From equation 3: ( f(1 + x) = -f(x - 1) ). Let me set ( x = 1 ):( f(1 + 1) = -f(1 - 1) ) => ( f(2) = -f(0) ).But we already know that ( f(2) = f(0) ). Therefore:( f(0) = -f(0) )Adding ( f(0) ) to both sides:( 2f(0) = 0 ) => ( f(0) = 0 ).Therefore, ( f(0) = 0 ), and since ( f(2) = f(0) ), ( f(2) = 0 ).So, summarizing:- ( f(2016) = f(0) = 0 )- ( f(2017) = f(1) = 4 )- ( f(2018) = f(2) = 0 )Therefore, the sum ( f(2016) + f(2017) + f(2018) = 0 + 4 + 0 = 4 ).But wait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.We started with ( f(x + 2) = f(-x) ) and found that ( f ) is periodic with period 4. Then, using the symmetry about (1, 0), we found that ( f(1 - x) = -f(x - 1) ), leading us to ( f(1 + x) = -f(x - 1) ), which then gave us ( f(x + 2) = -f(x) ), hence periodicity 4.Then, using the periodicity, we reduced 2016, 2017, 2018 modulo 4, which gave us 0, 1, 2 respectively. Then, we found ( f(0) ) by using the relations ( f(2) = f(0) ) and ( f(2) = -f(0) ), leading to ( f(0) = 0 ).Therefore, all steps seem consistent, and the final sum is 4.**Final Answer**boxed{4}"},{"question":"Theodore's old friend from Alexandria, Minnesota, fondly remembers a time when they both worked together on a community project involving restoring a historical building.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, since ( f(x) ) is a polynomial, let's denote its degree as ( n ). So, ( f(x) ) can be written as:[ f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + dots + a_1 x + a_0 ]where ( a_n neq 0 ).Now, let's analyze each term in the given equation:1. ( 8 f(x^3) ): If ( f(x) ) is degree ( n ), then ( f(x^3) ) would be degree ( 3n ). Multiplying by 8 doesn't change the degree, so this term is degree ( 3n ).2. ( -x^6 f(2x) ): Here, ( f(2x) ) is still a polynomial of degree ( n ), but each term is scaled by ( 2^k ) where ( k ) is the degree of that term. However, when multiplied by ( x^6 ), the degree becomes ( 6 + n ).3. ( -2 f(x^2) ): Similar to the first term, ( f(x^2) ) has degree ( 2n ), so this term is degree ( 2n ).4. ( +12 ): This is a constant term, degree 0.Now, the equation is a combination of these terms set equal to zero. For the entire equation to hold for all real ( x ), the coefficients of each power of ( x ) must sum to zero. Therefore, the highest degree terms must cancel each other out.Looking at the degrees:- The highest degree term is either ( 3n ) or ( 6 + n ), depending on which is larger.So, we need to find ( n ) such that ( 3n = 6 + n ), because otherwise, the highest degree term would not cancel out, and the equation couldn't hold for all ( x ).Let me solve for ( n ):[ 3n = 6 + n 3n - n = 6 2n = 6 n = 3 ]Okay, so the polynomial ( f(x) ) is of degree 3. That makes sense. So, ( f(x) ) is a cubic polynomial.Let me write ( f(x) ) as:[ f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d ]where ( a neq 0 ).Now, I need to compute each term in the given equation:1.

The constant term is +12.Now, let's combine all these terms:[ 8 f(x^3) - x^6 f(2x) - 2 f(x^2) + 12 = 0 ]Substituting the computed expressions:[ [8a x^9 + 8b x^6 + 8c x^3 + 8d] + [-8a x^9 - 4b x^8 - 2c x^7 - d x^6] + [-2a x^6 - 2b x^4 - 2c x^2 - 2d] + 12 = 0 ]Now, let's combine like terms:- ( x^9 ) terms: ( 8a x^9 - 8a x^9 = 0 )- ( x^8 ) terms: ( -4b x^8 )- ( x^7 ) terms: ( -2c x^7 )- ( x^6 ) terms: ( 8b x^6 - d x^6 - 2a x^6 = (8b - d - 2a) x^6 )- ( x^4 ) terms: ( -2b x^4 )- ( x^3 ) terms: ( 8c x^3 )- ( x^2 ) terms: ( -2c x^2 )- Constant terms: ( 8d - 2d + 12 = 6d + 12 )So, putting it all together, the equation becomes:[ -4b x^8 - 2c x^7 + (8b - d - 2a) x^6 - 2b x^4 + 8c x^3 - 2c x^2 + (6d + 12) = 0 ]Since this polynomial equals zero for all real ( x ), each coefficient must be zero. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:1. Coefficient of ( x^8 ): ( -4b = 0 ) ⇒ ( b = 0 )2. Coefficient of ( x^7 ): ( -2c = 0 ) ⇒ ( c = 0 )3. Coefficient of ( x^6 ): ( 8b - d - 2a = 0 ). Since ( b = 0 ), this simplifies to ( -d - 2a = 0 ) ⇒ ( d = -2a )4. Coefficient of ( x^4 ): ( -2b = 0 ). Again, since ( b = 0 ), this is satisfied.5. Coefficient of ( x^3 ): ( 8c = 0 ). Since ( c = 0 ), this is satisfied.6. Coefficient of ( x^2 ): ( -2c = 0 ). Again, satisfied.7. Constant term: ( 6d + 12 = 0 ) ⇒ ( 6d = -12 ) ⇒ ( d = -2 )Now, from equation 3, we had ( d = -2a ). But from the constant term, we found ( d = -2 ). Therefore:[ -2a = -2 a = 1 ]So, we have ( a = 1 ), ( b = 0 ), ( c = 0 ), and ( d = -2 ).Therefore, the polynomial ( f(x) ) is:[ f(x) = a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 1 cdot x^3 + 0 cdot x^2 + 0 cdot x - 2 = x^3 - 2 ]Let me double-check this solution by substituting ( f(x) = x^3 - 2 ) back into the original equation:Compute each term:1. ( 8 f(x^3) = 8(x^3)^3 - 8 cdot 2 = 8x^9 - 16 )2. ( -x^6 f(2x) = -x^6[(2x)^3 - 2] = -x^6(8x^3 - 2) = -8x^9 + 2x^6 )3. ( -2 f(x^2) = -2[(x^2)^3 - 2] = -2x^6 + 4 )4. The constant term is +12.Now, combine all terms:[ (8x^9 - 16) + (-8x^9 + 2x^6) + (-2x^6 + 4) + 12 ]Simplify:- ( 8x^9 - 8x^9 = 0 )- ( 2x^6 - 2x^6 = 0 )- Constants: ( -16 + 4 + 12 = 0 )So, everything cancels out, and we get 0, which matches the original equation.

Suppose all \\"powerful numbers\\" less than 1000 have their digits forming set A, then the sum of the digits in set A is boxed{6}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about \\"powerful numbers.\\" Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that a natural number ( n ) is called a \\"powerful number\\" if when you add ( n ), ( n + 1 ), and ( n + 2 ) together, there's no carry-over in any digit during the addition. For example, 32 is a powerful number because ( 32 + 33 + 34 ) doesn't produce any carry-over. On the other hand, 23 isn't because ( 23 + 24 + 25 ) does produce a carry-over.The task is to find all powerful numbers less than 1000, collect their digits into a set ( A ), and then find the sum of the digits in set ( A ). The answer is given as 6, but I need to figure out why.First, let me clarify what a carry-over means. In addition, a carry-over occurs when the sum of digits in a particular place exceeds 9. For example, adding 5 and 6 in the units place gives 11, which means we carry over 1 to the tens place. So, in the context of this problem, adding ( n ), ( n + 1 ), and ( n + 2 ) should not result in any digit sum exceeding 9 in any place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.).Let me think about how adding three consecutive numbers affects each digit. Let's denote ( n ) as a number with digits ( d_k d_{k-1} dots d_1 d_0 ), where ( d_0 ) is the units digit, ( d_1 ) is the tens digit, and so on. Then, ( n + 1 ) would increment the last digit by 1, and ( n + 2 ) would increment it by 2. However, if adding 1 or 2 causes a carry-over in ( n + 1 ) or ( n + 2 ), that could affect the digits beyond the units place.Wait, but the problem is about the addition ( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) ). So, let me compute this sum:( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 3n + 3 = 3(n + 1) ).So, the sum is three times ( n + 1 ). Therefore, for the addition ( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) ) to have no carry-over, the multiplication ( 3(n + 1) ) must not produce any carry-over in any digit.That's an important observation. So, instead of thinking about adding three numbers, I can think about multiplying ( n + 1 ) by 3 without any carry-over in any digit.So, the condition is that when you multiply ( n + 1 ) by 3, each digit of ( n + 1 ) multiplied by 3 must be less than 10. That is, each digit ( d ) in ( n + 1 ) must satisfy ( 3d < 10 ). Therefore, ( d ) must be less than or equal to 3 because ( 3 times 3 = 9 ), which is less than 10, but ( 3 times 4 = 12 ), which is 10 or more, causing a carry-over.Wait, so each digit in ( n + 1 ) must be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, ( n + 1 ) must be a number where every digit is at most 3. Hence, ( n ) must be a number where every digit is at most 2 because ( n = (n + 1) - 1 ). So, subtracting 1 from a number with digits 0-3, each digit in ( n ) would be 0-2, except possibly when there's a borrow involved.Wait, hold on. If ( n + 1 ) has digits 0-3, then ( n ) would have digits 0-2, except in cases where a digit in ( n + 1 ) is 0, which would mean the corresponding digit in ( n ) is 9 (if we're considering numbers with leading zeros, which we aren't). Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully.Let me consider ( n ) as a k-digit number. Then, ( n + 1 ) is a k-digit number where each digit is at most 3. So, ( n ) must be such that when you add 1 to it, none of its digits exceed 3. That means that in ( n ), each digit must be at most 2, except possibly the last digit, which can be 9, but adding 1 would carry over. Wait, no, if ( n ) is such that ( n + 1 ) doesn't have any digit exceeding 3, then ( n ) must have each digit at most 2, except possibly the last digit, which can be 9, but that would cause a carry-over when adding 1, which would make the second last digit increase by 1, potentially exceeding 3.Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of each digit. Let's break it down digit by digit.Let me denote ( n ) as ( d_k d_{k-1} dots d_1 d_0 ), so ( n + 1 ) would be ( d_k d_{k-1} dots (d_1 + 1) (d_0 + 1) ), but actually, adding 1 can cause a carry-over if ( d_0 = 9 ). So, if ( d_0 ) is 9, adding 1 would make it 0 and carry over 1 to ( d_1 ). Similarly, if ( d_1 ) is 9, adding the carry-over would make it 0 and carry over to ( d_2 ), and so on.But since ( n + 1 ) must have all digits at most 3, this implies that in ( n ), each digit must be such that when you add 1 (and any carry-over from the previous digit), the result is at most 3.Wait, let's formalize this.Let me denote ( n ) as ( d_k d_{k-1} dots d_1 d_0 ). Then, ( n + 1 ) is computed as follows:- Start from the least significant digit (units place). If ( d_0 neq 9 ), then ( d_0' = d_0 + 1 ), and all other digits remain the same. If ( d_0 = 9 ), then ( d_0' = 0 ), and we carry over 1 to ( d_1 ). If ( d_1 ) is also 9, then ( d_1' = 0 ), and carry over 1 to ( d_2 ), and so on.But since ( n + 1 ) must have all digits at most 3, each digit after addition must satisfy ( d_i' leq 3 ). So, let's analyze each digit.Starting from the units digit:1. Units digit: ( d_0' = d_0 + 1 ) (if no carry-over from previous digit, but since it's the least significant digit, there's no carry-over into it). So, ( d_0 + 1 leq 3 ) implies ( d_0 leq 2 ).2. Tens digit: ( d_1' = d_1 + c_1 ), where ( c_1 ) is the carry-over from the units digit. If ( d_0 = 9 ), then ( c_1 = 1 ); otherwise, ( c_1 = 0 ). But wait, we already established that ( d_0 leq 2 ), so ( c_1 = 0 ). Therefore, ( d_1' = d_1 leq 3 ). So, ( d_1 leq 3 ).Wait, hold on. If ( d_0 leq 2 ), then adding 1 doesn't cause a carry-over, so ( c_1 = 0 ). Therefore, ( d_1' = d_1 leq 3 ), so ( d_1 leq 3 ).Similarly, moving to the hundreds digit:3. Hundreds digit: ( d_2' = d_2 + c_2 ), where ( c_2 ) is the carry-over from the tens digit. But since ( d_1 leq 3 ), adding 1 (if there was a carry-over from the units digit) would be ( d_1 + 1 leq 4 ). Wait, but in our case, ( c_2 ) would be 0 because ( d_1 leq 3 ) and ( c_1 = 0 ). Therefore, ( d_2' = d_2 leq 3 ), so ( d_2 leq 3 ).Wait, actually, hold on. When adding 1 to ( n ), the carry-over only happens if a digit is 9. But since all digits ( d_0, d_1, d_2, dots ) are at most 3, adding 1 to ( n ) can only cause a carry-over if a digit is 9, but since all digits are at most 3, adding 1 won't cause a carry-over beyond the current digit. Wait, no, actually, if ( d_0 leq 2 ), adding 1 won't cause a carry-over. Similarly, ( d_1 leq 3 ), so adding 1 (if there was a carry-over from ( d_0 )) would be ( d_1 + 1 leq 4 ). But since ( d_1 leq 3 ), ( d_1 + 1 leq 4 ), which is still less than 10, so no carry-over occurs. Wait, but ( d_1' ) must be ( leq 3 ) as per the condition that ( n + 1 ) has all digits ( leq 3 ). Therefore, ( d_1 + c_1 leq 3 ). Since ( c_1 = 0 ), ( d_1 leq 3 ).Similarly, for the hundreds digit, ( d_2 + c_2 leq 3 ). But ( c_2 ) is the carry-over from the tens digit. Since ( d_1 leq 3 ), adding 1 (if ( c_1 = 1 )) would be ( d_1 + 1 leq 4 ). But wait, ( c_1 = 0 ), so ( d_1' = d_1 leq 3 ), so ( c_2 = 0 ). Therefore, ( d_2 leq 3 ).Wait, this seems to be a pattern. Each digit in ( n + 1 ) is equal to the corresponding digit in ( n ) plus 0 or 1, but since ( n + 1 ) must have all digits ( leq 3 ), each digit in ( n ) must be ( leq 3 ) as well, except possibly the last digit, but we saw that the last digit must be ( leq 2 ).Wait, let's formalize this:For each digit ( d_i ) in ( n ):- If it's the units digit (( d_0 )), then ( d_0 + 1 leq 3 ) implies ( d_0 leq 2 ).- For other digits (( d_i ), ( i geq 1 )), since adding 1 to ( n ) doesn't cause a carry-over beyond the units digit (because ( d_0 leq 2 )), so ( d_i' = d_i leq 3 ). Therefore, ( d_i leq 3 ).Therefore, in ( n ), the units digit must be ( leq 2 ), and all other digits must be ( leq 3 ).So, to summarize, a number ( n ) is a powerful number if and only if:- Its units digit is 0, 1, or 2.- All other digits (tens, hundreds, etc.) are 0, 1, 2, or 3.Therefore, all powerful numbers less than 1000 must satisfy these digit constraints.Now, let's think about all powerful numbers less than 1000. Since 1000 is a four-digit number, we're considering numbers from 1 up to 999.So, let's break it down by the number of digits:1. **1-digit numbers (1-9):**   - Units digit must be 0, 1, or 2.   - So, the powerful numbers are 1, 2, and 3? Wait, no. Wait, the units digit must be 0, 1, or 2, but since we're considering natural numbers, starting from 1. So, 1, 2, and 3? Wait, no, because 3 is allowed? Wait, hold on.Wait, actually, for 1-digit numbers, ( n ) must satisfy that ( n + 1 ) has digits ( leq 3 ). Since ( n ) is a single digit, ( n + 1 ) is also a single digit. So, ( n + 1 leq 3 ) implies ( n leq 2 ). Therefore, the powerful numbers among 1-digit numbers are 1 and 2.Wait, but the problem says \\"natural numbers,\\" so starting from 1. So, 1 and 2 are powerful numbers.2. **2-digit numbers (10-99):**   - The units digit must be 0, 1, or 2.   - The tens digit must be 0, 1, 2, or 3.   - So, the tens digit can be 1, 2, or 3 (since leading zeros aren't allowed in numbers), and the units digit can be 0, 1, or 2.   Therefore, the number of 2-digit powerful numbers is 3 (choices for tens digit: 1, 2, 3) multiplied by 3 (choices for units digit: 0, 1, 2), which is 9 numbers.   Let me list them:   - 10, 11, 12   - 20, 21, 22   - 30, 31, 32   So, 9 numbers.3. **3-digit numbers (100-999):**   - The units digit must be 0, 1, or 2.   - The tens digit must be 0, 1, 2, or 3.   - The hundreds digit must be 1, 2, or 3 (since leading zeros aren't allowed).   Therefore, the number of 3-digit powerful numbers is 3 (hundreds digit) * 4 (tens digit: 0,1,2,3) * 3 (units digit: 0,1,2) = 3*4*3 = 36 numbers.   Let me confirm this logic:   - Hundreds digit: 1, 2, 3   - Tens digit: 0, 1, 2, 3   - Units digit: 0, 1, 2   So, yes, 3*4*3 = 36.So, in total, the powerful numbers less than 1000 are:- 1-digit: 2 numbers (1, 2)- 2-digit: 9 numbers- 3-digit: 36 numbersTotal: 2 + 9 + 36 = 47 powerful numbers.Wait, but the problem says \\"all powerful numbers less than 1000,\\" so including 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers.Now, the next step is to collect all the digits from these powerful numbers into a set ( A ). Since it's a set, each digit is unique, regardless of how many times it appears.So, let's figure out which digits appear in these powerful numbers.First, let's consider the digits in each place:1. **Units place:**   - For all powerful numbers, the units digit is 0, 1, or 2.2. **Tens place:**   - For 2-digit and 3-digit numbers, the tens digit is 0, 1, 2, or 3.3. **Hundreds place:**   - For 3-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3.Additionally, in 1-digit numbers, the digits are 1 and 2.So, compiling all digits:- From units place: 0, 1, 2- From tens place: 0, 1, 2, 3- From hundreds place: 1, 2, 3Therefore, the set ( A ) consists of digits 0, 1, 2, 3.Wait, but hold on. In the hundreds place, digits are 1, 2, 3. In the tens place, digits are 0, 1, 2, 3. In the units place, digits are 0, 1, 2. So, combining all these, the unique digits are 0, 1, 2, 3.But wait, let me check if 0 is included. In the hundreds place, 0 isn't allowed because it's a 3-digit number, so the hundreds digit can't be 0. However, in the tens place, 0 is allowed, and in the units place, 0 is allowed. So, 0 is present in the tens and units digits.Therefore, the set ( A ) is {0, 1, 2, 3}.Wait, but the problem statement says \\"the digits forming set ( A )\\", and it's talking about digits of all powerful numbers less than 1000. So, 0 is included because, for example, 10 is a powerful number, which has a 0 in the units place. Similarly, 20, 30, etc.So, set ( A ) is {0, 1, 2, 3}, and the sum of the digits in set ( A ) is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.Therefore, the answer is 6.But wait, hold on a second. Let me make sure that all digits 0, 1, 2, 3 are indeed present in the powerful numbers.- 0: Yes, for example, 10, 20, 30, etc., have 0 in the units or tens place.- 1: Yes, in numbers like 1, 10, 11, 12, 21, 31, etc.- 2: Yes, in numbers like 2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 32, etc.- 3: Yes, in numbers like 3 (wait, is 3 a powerful number? Let me check.Wait, 3 is a 1-digit number. Let's verify if 3 is a powerful number.Compute ( 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 ). Wait, 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. But 12 is a two-digit number, but the addition process: adding units digits: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, which causes a carry-over of 1 to the tens place. So, actually, 3 is not a powerful number because adding 3 + 4 + 5 does produce a carry-over.Wait, hold on! That contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, 3 is not a powerful number. Therefore, 3 is not included in the set ( A ).Wait, so my earlier reasoning was flawed. Let me re-examine.Earlier, I thought that ( n + 1 ) must have all digits ( leq 3 ), so ( n ) must have digits ( leq 3 ) except the units digit ( leq 2 ). But in reality, ( n ) is a powerful number if ( 3(n + 1) ) has no carry-over in any digit. So, each digit of ( n + 1 ) must satisfy ( 3d_i leq 9 ), which is ( d_i leq 3 ). Therefore, ( n + 1 ) must have digits ( leq 3 ), so ( n ) must have digits ( leq 3 ) except possibly the last digit, which can be 9, but adding 1 would cause a carry-over, which would affect the next digit.Wait, but in the case of 3, ( n = 3 ), ( n + 1 = 4 ). But 4 is a single digit, which is greater than 3, so ( n + 1 ) is 4, which has a digit exceeding 3, so 3 is not a powerful number.Wait, so in fact, the digits of ( n + 1 ) must be ( leq 3 ). Therefore, ( n + 1 ) must have digits 0, 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, ( n ) must have digits 0, 1, 2, or 3, except that when you subtract 1, the digits could potentially be 9 if there was a borrow. Wait, no, because ( n + 1 ) is a number where each digit is ( leq 3 ), so ( n ) must be such that each digit is ( leq 3 ), except possibly the last digit, which can be 9, but adding 1 would cause a carry-over, making the next digit increase by 1, which must still be ( leq 3 ).Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.If ( n + 1 ) has all digits ( leq 3 ), then ( n ) must be such that when you subtract 1, each digit is ( leq 3 ). So, if ( n + 1 ) is a number with digits ( d_k d_{k-1} dots d_0 ), each ( d_i leq 3 ), then ( n ) is ( d_k d_{k-1} dots (d_0 - 1) ), but if ( d_0 = 0 ), then ( n ) would have a borrow, making the last digit 9 and the previous digit decreased by 1.Wait, so ( n ) can have digits 9 in some places if there's a borrow when subtracting 1 from ( n + 1 ). For example, if ( n + 1 = 100 ), then ( n = 99 ). But ( n = 99 ) has digits 9 and 9, which are greater than 3, but ( n + 1 = 100 ) has digits 1, 0, 0, which are ( leq 3 ). So, ( n = 99 ) would be a powerful number because ( n + 1 = 100 ), which when multiplied by 3 gives 300, which has no carry-over.Wait, but hold on. Let's test ( n = 99 ). Compute ( 99 + 100 + 101 = 299 + 101 = 300 ). Wait, 99 + 100 + 101 = 300. So, adding 99 + 100 + 101, let's do it digit by digit:- Units place: 9 + 0 + 1 = 10. Wait, that's a carry-over of 1.- Tens place: 9 + 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 10. Another carry-over.- Hundreds place: 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 3.Wait, so actually, adding 99 + 100 + 101 does produce carry-overs in the units and tens places. Therefore, 99 is not a powerful number. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.Wait, so my earlier reasoning was wrong. So, even though ( n + 1 = 100 ) has digits ( leq 3 ), when we add ( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) ), it's equivalent to ( 3(n + 1) ). So, ( 3(n + 1) ) must not have any carry-over in any digit. So, ( 3(n + 1) ) must have each digit ( leq 9 ), but actually, no, it's more precise: when adding ( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) ), each digit-wise addition must not exceed 9.Wait, but ( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 3n + 3 ). So, if we think of it as ( 3(n + 1) ), which is the same as ( 3n + 3 ). So, for ( 3(n + 1) ) to have no carry-over, each digit of ( n + 1 ) multiplied by 3 must be ( leq 9 ). Therefore, each digit of ( n + 1 ) must be ( leq 3 ), because ( 3 times 4 = 12 ), which would cause a carry-over.Therefore, ( n + 1 ) must have all digits ( leq 3 ). So, ( n ) must be such that ( n + 1 ) has all digits ( leq 3 ). Therefore, ( n ) must be such that each digit is ( leq 3 ), except possibly the last digit, which can be 9, but adding 1 would cause a carry-over, which would make the next digit ( leq 3 ).Wait, but in the case of ( n = 99 ), ( n + 1 = 100 ), which has digits 1, 0, 0. So, 1 is ( leq 3 ), 0 is ( leq 3 ), so ( n + 1 ) is okay. But when we compute ( 3(n + 1) = 300 ), which is fine, but when we compute ( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) ), which is 99 + 100 + 101, we get 300, but in the process, adding the units digits: 9 + 0 + 1 = 10, which causes a carry-over. So, even though ( 3(n + 1) ) is 300, which doesn't have a carry-over, the addition ( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) ) does have carry-over because it's adding three numbers, not just multiplying by 3.Wait, so my initial conclusion was wrong. The condition is not just that ( 3(n + 1) ) has no carry-over, but that the addition ( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) ) has no carry-over in any digit. So, it's not sufficient that ( 3(n + 1) ) has no carry-over; rather, the addition process itself must not have any carry-over.Therefore, I need to re-examine my approach.Let me think about how adding ( n ), ( n + 1 ), and ( n + 2 ) affects each digit.Let me denote ( n ) as ( d_k d_{k-1} dots d_1 d_0 ). Then, ( n + 1 ) is ( d_k d_{k-1} dots (d_1 + c_1) (d_0 + 1) ), where ( c_1 ) is the carry-over from the units digit. Similarly, ( n + 2 ) is ( d_k d_{k-1} dots (d_1 + c_2) (d_0 + 2) ), with carry-over ( c_2 ).But when adding ( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) ), we can think of it as adding three numbers:- ( n ): ( d_k d_{k-1} dots d_1 d_0 )- ( n + 1 ): ( d_k d_{k-1} dots (d_1 + c_1) (d_0 + 1) )- ( n + 2 ): ( d_k d_{k-1} dots (d_1 + c_2) (d_0 + 2) )But this seems complicated because of the carry-overs in ( n + 1 ) and ( n + 2 ). Maybe a better approach is to consider each digit separately, considering the addition without carry-over.Wait, another way: when adding three numbers, ( n ), ( n + 1 ), ( n + 2 ), the sum in each digit place is ( d_i + (d_i + c_i^{(1)}) + (d_i + c_i^{(2)}) ), where ( c_i^{(1)} ) and ( c_i^{(2)} ) are the carry-overs from the previous digit when adding 1 and 2 respectively.Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should think in terms of each digit in ( n ), ( n + 1 ), ( n + 2 ), and ensure that their sum in each digit place doesn't exceed 9.Let me consider each digit place separately:1. **Units place:**   - ( n ) has digit ( d_0 )   - ( n + 1 ) has digit ( d_0 + 1 ) (if ( d_0 neq 9 )) or 0 with a carry-over (if ( d_0 = 9 ))   - ( n + 2 ) has digit ( d_0 + 2 ) (if ( d_0 leq 7 )), or 1 with a carry-over (if ( d_0 = 8 )), or 0 with a carry-over (if ( d_0 = 9 ))   So, the sum in the units place is:   - If ( d_0 leq 7 ): ( d_0 + (d_0 + 1) + (d_0 + 2) = 3d_0 + 3 )   - If ( d_0 = 8 ): ( 8 + 9 + 0 + 1 ) (carry-over from ( n + 2 ))   - If ( d_0 = 9 ): ( 9 + 0 + 1 + 1 ) (carry-over from ( n + 1 ) and ( n + 2 ))   Wait, but in the problem statement, the addition ( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) ) must not produce any carry-over. So, the sum in each digit place must be ( leq 9 ).   So, for the units place:   - If ( d_0 leq 7 ): ( 3d_0 + 3 leq 9 )     - So, ( 3d_0 + 3 leq 9 ) implies ( 3d_0 leq 6 ) implies ( d_0 leq 2 )   - If ( d_0 = 8 ): The sum would be ( 8 + 9 + 0 = 17 ), which is ( geq 10 ), causing a carry-over. So, not allowed.   - If ( d_0 = 9 ): The sum would be ( 9 + 0 + 1 = 10 ), which also causes a carry-over. So, not allowed.   Therefore, ( d_0 ) must be ( leq 2 ).2. **Tens place:**   - Similarly, let's denote the tens digit of ( n ) as ( d_1 ).   - When adding ( n ), ( n + 1 ), ( n + 2 ), the tens digits are ( d_1 ), ( d_1 ) or ( d_1 + 1 ) (if there was a carry-over from the units place in ( n + 1 )), and ( d_1 ) or ( d_1 + 1 ) (if there was a carry-over from the units place in ( n + 2 )).   Wait, but since ( d_0 leq 2 ), adding 1 or 2 to ( d_0 ) doesn't cause a carry-over. So, in ( n + 1 ) and ( n + 2 ), the tens digit remains ( d_1 ).   Therefore, the sum in the tens place is ( d_1 + d_1 + d_1 = 3d_1 ).   For no carry-over, ( 3d_1 leq 9 ), so ( d_1 leq 3 ).3. **Hundreds place:**   - Similarly, the hundreds digit of ( n ) is ( d_2 ).   - Since ( d_1 leq 3 ), adding 1 or 2 to ( d_1 ) in ( n + 1 ) and ( n + 2 ) doesn't cause a carry-over (since ( d_1 + 1 leq 4 ) and ( d_1 + 2 leq 5 ), both less than 10). Therefore, the hundreds digit remains ( d_2 ) in all three numbers.   Therefore, the sum in the hundreds place is ( d_2 + d_2 + d_2 = 3d_2 ).   For no carry-over, ( 3d_2 leq 9 ), so ( d_2 leq 3 ).4. **Thousands place:**   - Since we're considering numbers less than 1000, the thousands place doesn't exist. So, we can ignore it.Therefore, putting it all together:- Units digit ( d_0 leq 2 )- Tens digit ( d_1 leq 3 )- Hundreds digit ( d_2 leq 3 )Additionally, since we're dealing with natural numbers, the hundreds digit can be 0, but in reality, for 3-digit numbers, it must be at least 1.Wait, but for 1-digit and 2-digit numbers, the higher digits are considered as 0. So, for example, the number 5 is treated as 005, but leading zeros aren't counted as digits in the number itself. However, when considering the digits of the number, leading zeros aren't included. Therefore, in the set ( A ), digits from leading zeros (which don't exist) aren't included.Therefore, the digits in the powerful numbers are:- For 1-digit numbers: 1 and 2 (since 3 is not a powerful number, as we saw earlier)- For 2-digit numbers: tens digit can be 1, 2, 3; units digit can be 0, 1, 2- For 3-digit numbers: hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3; tens digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3; units digit can be 0, 1, 2Therefore, compiling all digits:- From 1-digit numbers: 1, 2- From 2-digit numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3 (tens digit) and 0, 1, 2 (units digit)- From 3-digit numbers: 1, 2, 3 (hundreds digit), 0, 1, 2, 3 (tens digit), 0, 1, 2 (units digit)So, combining all these, the unique digits are 0, 1, 2, 3.But wait, earlier I thought 3 might not be included because 3 itself isn't a powerful number. However, 3 is included as a digit in other numbers, like 13, 23, 30, 31, 32, etc.Wait, let's verify if 3 is indeed a digit in some powerful numbers.Take 13: Let's check if 13 is a powerful number.Compute ( 13 + 14 + 15 ). Let's add digit by digit:- Units place: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, which causes a carry-over. So, 13 is not a powerful number.Wait, so 13 is not a powerful number. Hmm, so even though 13 has a digit 3, it's not a powerful number because adding 13 + 14 + 15 causes a carry-over.Wait, so maybe my earlier conclusion that digits 0, 1, 2, 3 are all included is incorrect because some numbers with these digits aren't powerful numbers.Wait, this is getting more complicated. So, perhaps I need to list all powerful numbers less than 1000 and then collect their digits.But that would be time-consuming, but maybe necessary.Let me try to list all powerful numbers less than 1000.Starting with 1-digit numbers:- ( n = 1 ): ( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 ). No carry-over. So, 1 is powerful.- ( n = 2 ): ( 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 ). No carry-over. So, 2 is powerful.- ( n = 3 ): ( 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 ). Carry-over. Not powerful.So, 1 and 2 are powerful.Now, 2-digit numbers:We need to find all 2-digit numbers ( n = 10a + b ) where ( a ) is 1-9 and ( b ) is 0-9, such that ( n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) ) has no carry-over.From earlier analysis, ( b leq 2 ) and ( a leq 3 ).So, possible ( a ): 1, 2, 3Possible ( b ): 0, 1, 2Therefore, the 2-digit powerful numbers are:10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32Let me verify one of them:Take ( n = 10 ): ( 10 + 11 + 12 = 33 ). Adding digit-wise:- Units: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 (no carry)- Tens: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (no carry)So, no carry-over. Good.Take ( n = 12 ): ( 12 + 13 + 14 = 39 ). Digit-wise:- Units: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 (no carry)- Tens: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (no carry)Good.Take ( n = 32 ): ( 32 + 33 + 34 = 99 ). Digit-wise:- Units: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 (no carry)- Tens: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 (no carry)Good.Now, 3-digit numbers:Similarly, ( n = 100a + 10b + c ), where ( a ) is 1-3, ( b ) is 0-3, ( c ) is 0-2.So, the 3-digit powerful numbers are all combinations of ( a in {1,2,3} ), ( b in {0,1,2,3} ), ( c in {0,1,2} ).That's 3 * 4 * 3 = 36 numbers.Let me verify one example:Take ( n = 100 ): ( 100 + 101 + 102 = 303 ). Digit-wise:- Units: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 (no carry)- Tens: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 (no carry)- Hundreds: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (no carry)Good.Take ( n = 123 ): Wait, ( n = 123 ) is a 3-digit number with ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), ( c = 3 ). Wait, but ( c ) must be ( leq 2 ), so 123 is not a powerful number. Wait, actually, in our earlier analysis, ( c ) must be ( leq 2 ), so ( n = 123 ) is not a powerful number.Wait, but ( n = 123 ) is not in our list because ( c = 3 ), which is not allowed. So, all 3-digit powerful numbers have ( c leq 2 ).Another example: ( n = 332 ): ( 332 + 333 + 334 = 999 + 334 = 1333? Wait, no, let me compute correctly.Wait, ( 332 + 333 = 665 ), then ( 665 + 334 = 999 ). Digit-wise:- Units: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 (no carry)- Tens: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 (no carry)- Hundreds: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 (no carry)So, 332 is a powerful number.Wait, but 332 has a hundreds digit 3, which is allowed, and tens digit 3, which is allowed, and units digit 2, which is allowed.So, all 3-digit powerful numbers are of the form ( a b c ) where ( a in {1,2,3} ), ( b in {0,1,2,3} ), ( c in {0,1,2} ).Therefore, all these numbers are powerful.Now, compiling all digits from all powerful numbers:1-digit powerful numbers: 1, 2. Digits: 1, 2.2-digit powerful numbers: 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32. Digits: 0, 1, 2, 3.3-digit powerful numbers: All numbers from 100 to 332 with ( a in {1,2,3} ), ( b in {0,1,2,3} ), ( c in {0,1,2} ). So, digits: 0, 1, 2, 3 in all places.Therefore, the set ( A ) consists of digits 0, 1, 2, 3.But wait, earlier I saw that 3 is not a powerful number, but 3 is a digit in other powerful numbers. So, in the set ( A ), digits are collected from all powerful numbers, regardless of whether the digit itself is a powerful number.So, for example, the number 30 is a powerful number, so digit 3 is included in set ( A ).Therefore, set ( A ) is {0, 1, 2, 3}, and the sum is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.Therefore, the answer is 6.But just to make sure, let me check if all digits 0, 1, 2, 3 are indeed present in the powerful numbers.- 0: Present in numbers like 10, 20, 30, 100, 101, etc.- 1: Present in numbers like 1, 10, 11, 12, 21, 31, etc.- 2: Present in numbers like 2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 32, etc.- 3: Present in numbers like 30, 31, 32, 130, 131, etc.Yes, all digits 0, 1, 2, 3 are present in the powerful numbers. Therefore, set ( A ) is {0, 1, 2, 3}, and their sum is 6.**Final Answer**boxed{6}"},{"question":"Your sibling, who has traveled to Japan, is planning to visit historical sites in Kyoto with you. They know that Kyoto has a rich history with many temples and shrines. They suggest visiting a total of 12 sites over two days, with each day including a different number of sites to manage travel time and energy levels.1. On the first day, you plan to visit x historical sites. On the second day, you want to visit twice as many sites as on the first day. How many sites will you visit on the first and second days? Set up and solve a linear equation to find the number of sites visited each day.2. While planning the trip, your sibling also mentions that the cost of visiting these sites is budgeted at 360 for the entrance fees for both days. On the first day, each site's entrance fee is 20, and on the second day, each site's entrance fee is 30. Use this information to set up and solve a system of equations to verify the number of sites visited each day.","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of historical sites visited on each day. On the first day, the number of sites is represented by ( x ). On the second day, the number of sites is twice that of the first day, which is ( 2x ).The total number of sites visited over the two days is 12. Therefore, I can set up the equation:[x + 2x = 12]Combining like terms gives:[3x = 12]Solving for ( x ) by dividing both sides by 3:[x = 4]So, on the first day, 4 sites are visited, and on the second day, ( 2 times 4 = 8 ) sites are visited.Next, I need to verify this using the budget information. The total entrance fees for both days amount to 360. On the first day, each site costs 20, and on the second day, each site costs 30. I can set up the following system of equations:[begin{cases}x + 2x = 12 20x + 30(2x) = 360end{cases}]Simplifying the second equation:[20x + 60x = 360 80x = 360 x = 4.5]However, this result contradicts the earlier finding that ( x = 4 ).

Write an inequality to represent this budget constraint and solve for ( x ).2. Additionally, the couple has a small business that contributes to their income. The business's monthly profit ( P(x) ), depending on the amount of investment ( x ) (in hundreds of dollars), is modeled by the quadratic equation ( P(x) = -2x^2 + 12x + 5 ). Determine the amount of investment that will maximize their monthly profit, and find the maximum profit.","answer":"First, I need to address the budget constraint. The couple spends ( x ) dollars on necessary expenses and sets aside ( frac{1}{4}x ) for savings. The total of these two should not exceed 3,000. This gives the inequality ( x + frac{1}{4}x leq 3000 ). Combining the terms, I get ( frac{5}{4}x leq 3000 ). To solve for ( x ), I multiply both sides by ( frac{4}{5} ), resulting in ( x leq 2400 ).Next, for the business profit, the profit function is given by ( P(x) = -2x^2 + 12x + 5 ). Since this is a quadratic function opening downward, the maximum profit occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is found using ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ), where ( a = -2 ) and ( b = 12 ). Plugging in the values, I get ( x = 3 ). Substituting ( x = 3 ) back into the profit function gives ( P(3) = -2(3)^2 + 12(3) + 5 = 35 ).

In his garden, he has two types of Zen plants: Type A and Type B.1. The number of Type A Zen plants is three more than twice the number of Type B Zen plants. If the total number of Zen plants is 27, set up a system of equations and find how many of each type of Zen plant Mr. Gray has.2. Mr. Gray wants to place a small stone border around his Zen plant garden to enhance its tranquility. The garden is rectangular, and its length is 4 meters more than its width. If the perimeter of the garden is 36 meters, find the dimensions of the garden.","answer":"First, I'll tackle the problem about the Zen plants. Let's denote the number of Type A plants as A and Type B plants as B. According to the problem, Type A is three more than twice Type B, so I can write the equation A = 2B + 3. The total number of plants is 27, which gives me the second equation A + B = 27. To find the values of A and B, I'll substitute the first equation into the second. Replacing A with 2B + 3 in the second equation gives 2B + 3 + B = 27. Combining like terms, I get 3B + 3 = 27. Subtracting 3 from both sides results in 3B = 24, and dividing by 3 gives B = 8. Plugging B back into the first equation, A = 2(8) + 3 = 19. So, Mr. Gray has 19 Type A plants and 8 Type B plants.Next, I'll solve the problem about the garden's dimensions. Let's let W represent the width and L represent the length of the garden. The problem states that the length is 4 meters more than the width, so L = W + 4. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2(L + W). Substituting the known perimeter of 36 meters, I have 2((W + 4) + W) = 36. Simplifying inside the parentheses gives 2(2W + 4) = 36. Distributing the 2 results in 4W + 8 = 36. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 4W = 28, and dividing by 4 yields W = 7 meters. Using the relationship L = W + 4, the length is 7 + 4 = 11 meters. Therefore, the garden is 7 meters wide and 11 meters long."},{"question":"A retired ceramic artist has decided to teach a stressed-out office worker the art of creating ceramic pots.

How many of the first terms in the resulting sequence form an arithmetic progression?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here: The numbers (1000^{2}, 1001^{2}, 1002^{2}, ldots) have their last three digits discarded. I need to figure out how many of the first terms in the resulting sequence form an arithmetic progression. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand what it means to discard the last three digits. If I have a number, say, 123456, and I discard the last three digits, I'm left with 123. So essentially, it's like dividing the number by 1000 and taking the integer part. In mathematical terms, that would be the floor function: (leftlfloor frac{n}{1000} rightrfloor). So, for each term (n^2), we're calculating (leftlfloor frac{n^2}{1000} rightrfloor).The question is about how many of the first terms in this resulting sequence form an arithmetic progression. An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, if the sequence (a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots) is an AP, then (a_{k+1} - a_k = d) for some constant (d) and for all (k).Given that, I need to find the maximum number (m) such that the first (m) terms of the sequence (leftlfloor frac{n^2}{1000} rightrfloor) for (n = 1000, 1001, 1002, ldots) form an AP.Let me write down the first few terms to get a sense of what's happening.Starting with (n = 1000):- (1000^2 = 1,000,000). Discarding the last three digits gives (1000).- (1001^2 = 1,002,001). Discarding the last three digits gives (1002).- (1002^2 = 1,004,004). Discarding the last three digits gives (1004).- (1003^2 = 1,006,009). Discarding the last three digits gives (1006).- (1004^2 = 1,008,016). Discarding the last three digits gives (1008).- (1005^2 = 1,010,025). Discarding the last three digits gives (1010).- (1006^2 = 1,012,036). Discarding the last three digits gives (1012).- (1007^2 = 1,014,049). Discarding the last three digits gives (1014).- (1008^2 = 1,016,064). Discarding the last three digits gives (1016).- (1009^2 = 1,018,081). Discarding the last three digits gives (1018).- (1010^2 = 1,020,100). Discarding the last three digits gives (1020).Looking at these results, the sequence is (1000, 1002, 1004, 1006, 1008, 1010, 1012, 1014, 1016, 1018, 1020, ldots). Hmm, that seems like an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2. So, each term increases by 2. But wait, is this always the case?Let me check a few more terms to see if the pattern continues.- (1011^2 = 1,022,121). Discarding the last three digits gives (1022).- (1012^2 = 1,024,144). Discarding the last three digits gives (1024).- (1013^2 = 1,026,169). Discarding the last three digits gives (1026).- (1014^2 = 1,028,196). Discarding the last three digits gives (1028).- (1015^2 = 1,030,225). Discarding the last three digits gives (1030).So, the sequence continues as (1022, 1024, 1026, 1028, 1030, ldots). Still, each term increases by 2. So, up to (n = 1015), the difference is consistent.But wait, let me think about when this might change. Since we're discarding the last three digits, which is equivalent to taking the integer division by 1000, the behavior of the sequence depends on how (n^2) increases.Let me express (n) as (1000 + k), where (k) is a non-negative integer. So, (n = 1000 + k), and (k) starts at 0.Then, (n^2 = (1000 + k)^2 = 1000^2 + 2 times 1000 times k + k^2 = 1,000,000 + 2000k + k^2).When we discard the last three digits, we're effectively calculating (leftlfloor frac{n^2}{1000} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{1,000,000 + 2000k + k^2}{1000} rightrfloor).Simplifying that, we get:[leftlfloor 1000 + 2k + frac{k^2}{1000} rightrfloor]Since (k^2 / 1000) is less than 1 when (k < 32) because (32^2 = 1024), so for (k = 0) to (k = 31), (k^2 / 1000 < 1). Therefore, for these values of (k), the floor function will just be (1000 + 2k).So, for (k = 0) to (k = 31), the sequence is (1000 + 2k), which is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2.But when (k = 32), (k^2 = 1024), so (k^2 / 1000 = 1.024). Therefore, (leftlfloor 1000 + 2k + 1.024 rightrfloor = 1000 + 2k + 1).So, for (k = 32), the term becomes (1000 + 2 times 32 + 1 = 1000 + 64 + 1 = 1065).Wait, hold on. Let me compute (n = 1000 + 32 = 1032). Then, (1032^2 = (1000 + 32)^2 = 1,000,000 + 2 times 1000 times 32 + 32^2 = 1,000,000 + 64,000 + 1,024 = 1,065,024). Discarding the last three digits gives 1065.But the previous term was for (k = 31), which is (n = 1031). (1031^2 = (1000 + 31)^2 = 1,000,000 + 62,000 + 961 = 1,062,961). Discarding the last three digits gives 1062.So, the term before 1065 is 1062, and the next term is 1065. The difference here is 3, not 2. So, the common difference changes from 2 to 3 at this point.Therefore, the arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2 continues up until (k = 31), which corresponds to (n = 1031). Then, at (n = 1032), the difference becomes 3, breaking the arithmetic progression.Wait, but let me check (k = 31) and (k = 32) again.For (k = 31):(n = 1031), (n^2 = 1,062,961). Discarding last three digits: 1062.For (k = 32):(n = 1032), (n^2 = 1,065,024). Discarding last three digits: 1065.So, the difference is 1065 - 1062 = 3. So, yes, the difference increases by 1 here.Therefore, the arithmetic progression with difference 2 holds from (k = 0) to (k = 31), which is 32 terms. But wait, let's count: when (k = 0), that's the first term, (k = 1) is the second term, ..., (k = 31) is the 32nd term. So, the first 32 terms form an arithmetic progression with difference 2.But wait, let me check (k = 33):(n = 1033), (n^2 = (1000 + 33)^2 = 1,000,000 + 66,000 + 1,089 = 1,067,089). Discarding last three digits: 1067.So, the difference between (k = 32) and (k = 33) is 1067 - 1065 = 2. Hmm, so the difference goes back to 2? That's interesting.Wait, so maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me recast this.Wait, perhaps the difference alternates between 2 and 3? Or maybe it's more complicated.Wait, let's see:For (k = 31): 1062For (k = 32): 1065 (difference +3)For (k = 33): 1067 (difference +2)For (k = 34): Let's compute (n = 1034), (n^2 = 1,069,156). Discarding last three digits: 1069. So, difference is 1069 - 1067 = 2.Similarly, (k = 35): (n = 1035), (n^2 = 1,071,225). Discarding last three digits: 1071. Difference is 2.Wait, so after (k = 32), the difference goes back to 2. So, the progression is 1062, 1065, 1067, 1069, 1071,... So, the difference alternates between 3 and 2? Or is it that sometimes it's 2, sometimes 3?Wait, let me see:Looking at (k = 32): 1065(k = 33): 1067 (diff +2)(k = 34): 1069 (diff +2)(k = 35): 1071 (diff +2)Wait, so after (k = 32), the difference is consistently 2 again? Hmm, that seems inconsistent with my earlier thought.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing (k = 33). Let me recalculate (1033^2):(1033^2 = (1000 + 33)^2 = 1000^2 + 2*1000*33 + 33^2 = 1,000,000 + 66,000 + 1,089 = 1,067,089). So, discarding last three digits: 1067.Similarly, (1034^2 = (1000 + 34)^2 = 1,000,000 + 68,000 + 1,156 = 1,069,156). Discarding last three digits: 1069.So, the difference between (k = 32) and (k = 33) is 1067 - 1065 = 2, and between (k = 33) and (k = 34) is 1069 - 1067 = 2. So, actually, the difference remains 2 after (k = 32). So, why did (k = 32) have a difference of 3?Wait, let me check (k = 31) and (k = 32):(k = 31): (n = 1031), (n^2 = 1,062,961). Discard last three digits: 1062.(k = 32): (n = 1032), (n^2 = 1,065,024). Discard last three digits: 1065.So, 1065 - 1062 = 3. So, that jump is 3, but then the next jumps are 2 again.So, perhaps the difference is 2 for most terms, but occasionally jumps by 3 when (k^2) crosses a multiple of 1000.Wait, so when does (k^2) cross a multiple of 1000? That is, when (k^2 geq 1000), which is when (k geq 32), since (31^2 = 961) and (32^2 = 1024). So, when (k = 32), (k^2 = 1024), which is more than 1000, so the floor function adds an extra 1. So, that causes the term to jump by an extra 1, making the difference 3 instead of 2.But then, for (k = 33), (k^2 = 1089), which is still less than 2000, so (k^2 / 1000 = 1.089), so the floor function is still 1. So, the term is (1000 + 2k + 1). Wait, no, hold on.Wait, let's think again.We have:[leftlfloor frac{n^2}{1000} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 1000 + 2k + frac{k^2}{1000} rightrfloor]So, when (k^2 < 1000), (frac{k^2}{1000}) is less than 1, so the floor is just (1000 + 2k).When (k^2 geq 1000), (frac{k^2}{1000}) is at least 1, so the floor becomes (1000 + 2k + 1).Wait, but (k^2) is 1024 when (k = 32), so (frac{1024}{1000} = 1.024), so the floor is (1000 + 2*32 + 1 = 1065). Similarly, for (k = 33), (k^2 = 1089), so (frac{1089}{1000} = 1.089), so floor is (1000 + 2*33 + 1 = 1067).Wait, but for (k = 34), (k^2 = 1156), so (frac{1156}{1000} = 1.156), so floor is (1000 + 2*34 + 1 = 1069).Wait, so actually, once (k geq 32), the term becomes (1000 + 2k + 1). So, the difference between consecutive terms would be:For (k) and (k + 1):If (k geq 32), then term at (k) is (1000 + 2k + 1), term at (k + 1) is (1000 + 2(k + 1) + 1 = 1000 + 2k + 2 + 1 = 1000 + 2k + 3). So, the difference is ( (1000 + 2k + 3) - (1000 + 2k + 1) = 2).Wait, so actually, after (k = 32), the difference remains 2. So, the only time the difference is 3 is between (k = 31) and (k = 32). Because term at (k = 31) is (1000 + 2*31 = 1062), and term at (k = 32) is (1000 + 2*32 + 1 = 1065). So, the difference is 3.But from (k = 32) onwards, the difference is 2 again. So, the sequence is:1000, 1002, 1004, ..., 1062, 1065, 1067, 1069, 1071, ...So, the first 32 terms (from (k = 0) to (k = 31)) form an arithmetic progression with difference 2. Then, at (k = 32), the difference jumps by 3, but then continues with difference 2 again.Therefore, the first 32 terms form an arithmetic progression, but starting from the 33rd term, the difference changes. Wait, no, the 33rd term is still part of the sequence with difference 2, but the transition from 31 to 32 breaks the AP.Wait, actually, the first 32 terms are 1000, 1002, ..., 1062. Then, the 33rd term is 1065, which breaks the AP because the difference is 3 instead of 2. So, the AP is only maintained up to the 32nd term.But wait, let me count the number of terms. When (k = 0), that's the first term. So, (k = 0) to (k = 31) is 32 terms. So, the first 32 terms form an AP with difference 2, and the 33rd term breaks the AP.Wait, but hold on, let me check (k = 31) and (k = 32):Term 32: (k = 31), value 1062.Term 33: (k = 32), value 1065.So, the difference between term 32 and term 33 is 3, not 2. Therefore, the AP is only up to term 32.But wait, let me check (k = 32) and (k = 33):Term 33: 1065Term 34: 1067Difference is 2.So, after term 33, the difference is back to 2. So, actually, the AP is broken only between term 32 and 33, but continues after that. So, is the entire sequence an AP? No, because the difference between term 32 and 33 is 3, which is different from the previous difference of 2.Therefore, the first 32 terms form an AP, but starting from term 33, the difference is inconsistent with the previous terms. So, the first 32 terms are in AP, and starting from term 33, it's not.Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\"how many of the first terms in the resulting sequence form an arithmetic progression\\". So, it's asking for the maximum number (m) such that the first (m) terms form an AP.So, if the first 32 terms are in AP, but the 33rd term breaks it, then the answer is 32.But wait, let me check (k = 32) again. The term at (k = 32) is 1065, which is 3 more than the previous term. So, the AP is broken at this point. Therefore, the first 32 terms are in AP, and the 33rd term is not. So, the answer is 32.But wait, let me think about whether the AP could be longer. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the difference only changes once.Wait, let me consider (k = 32) to (k = 47). Let's compute a few more terms.For (k = 32): 1065(k = 33): 1067(k = 34): 1069(k = 35): 1071(k = 36): 1073(k = 37): 1075(k = 38): 1077(k = 39): 1079(k = 40): 1081(k = 41): 1083(k = 42): 1085(k = 43): 1087(k = 44): 1089(k = 45): 1091(k = 46): 1093(k = 47): 1095(k = 48): 1097(k = 49): 1099(k = 50): 1101Wait, so from (k = 32) onwards, each term increases by 2. So, the sequence after (k = 32) is also an AP with difference 2. But the transition from (k = 31) to (k = 32) is a jump of 3, which breaks the AP.Therefore, the first 32 terms are in AP, and starting from term 33, it's another AP with the same difference. But the entire sequence is not an AP because of the jump at term 33.But the question is asking for how many of the first terms form an AP. So, the maximum (m) such that the first (m) terms are in AP.Since the 33rd term breaks the AP, the maximum (m) is 32.Wait, but let me confirm:Term 1: 1000Term 2: 1002...Term 32: 1062Term 33: 1065So, the first 32 terms have a common difference of 2, but term 33 is 1065, which is 3 more than term 32. Therefore, the first 32 terms form an AP, but term 33 does not fit into that AP.Therefore, the answer is 32.But wait, let me check (k = 32) again. Is the term at (k = 32) actually 1065?Yes, (1032^2 = 1,065,024), discarding last three digits gives 1065.And term (k = 31) is 1062, so the difference is 3. So, yes, the AP is broken.Therefore, the number of terms is 32.But wait, let me think about the exact wording: \\"how many of the first terms in the resulting sequence form an arithmetic progression\\". So, it's possible that the entire sequence is an AP, but in this case, it's not because of the jump at (k = 32). So, the first 32 terms are in AP, but the 33rd term is not. Therefore, the answer is 32.But hold on, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that (k = 32) is the first term where the difference changes. Let me check (k = 16):(k = 16): (n = 1016), (n^2 = 1,032,256). Discarding last three digits: 1032.(k = 17): (n = 1017), (n^2 = 1,034,289). Discarding last three digits: 1034.Difference is 2.Wait, but (k = 16): 1032(k = 17): 1034Difference is 2.Similarly, (k = 31): 1062(k = 32): 1065Difference is 3.So, the difference only changes at (k = 32). So, before that, all differences are 2.Therefore, the first 32 terms are in AP, and term 33 is not. So, the answer is 32.But wait, let me check (k = 32) again. Is the term 1065? Yes. So, the difference is 3, which breaks the AP.Therefore, the maximum number of terms forming an AP is 32.Wait, but let me think about the general case. When does the floor function cause the difference to change?We have:[a_k = leftlfloor frac{(1000 + k)^2}{1000} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 1000 + 2k + frac{k^2}{1000} rightrfloor]So, (a_k = 1000 + 2k + leftlfloor frac{k^2}{1000} rightrfloor).So, the difference (a_{k+1} - a_k) is:[(1000 + 2(k+1) + leftlfloor frac{(k+1)^2}{1000} rightrfloor) - (1000 + 2k + leftlfloor frac{k^2}{1000} rightrfloor)]Simplifying:[2 + left( leftlfloor frac{(k+1)^2}{1000} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{k^2}{1000} rightrfloor right)]So, the difference is 2 plus the difference of the floor functions.Now, when does (leftlfloor frac{(k+1)^2}{1000} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{k^2}{1000} rightrfloor) equal 1?That happens when ((k+1)^2 geq 1000 times m) and (k^2 < 1000 times m) for some integer (m). In other words, when ((k+1)^2) crosses a multiple of 1000.So, for (k) such that ((k+1)^2 geq 1000 times m) and (k^2 < 1000 times m), the floor function increases by 1, making the difference 3 instead of 2.Therefore, the difference (a_{k+1} - a_k) is 3 when ((k+1)^2) crosses a multiple of 1000, and 2 otherwise.So, the first time this happens is when ((k+1)^2 geq 1000). Since (31^2 = 961) and (32^2 = 1024), the first time is at (k = 31), because ((31 + 1)^2 = 32^2 = 1024), which is the first multiple of 1000 crossed.Therefore, the difference increases by 1 at (k = 31), making the difference 3 between (k = 31) and (k = 32). Then, for (k geq 32), ((k+1)^2) may cross higher multiples of 1000, but as long as ((k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1 < 1000), the floor function difference remains 1, so the overall difference remains 3.Wait, no. Wait, actually, (leftlfloor frac{(k+1)^2}{1000} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{k^2}{1000} rightrfloor) can be 1 or more, depending on how much ((k+1)^2) exceeds (k^2).But since ((k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1), which is less than 1000 for (k < 500), the floor function difference can only be 0 or 1. So, the difference (a_{k+1} - a_k) can be 2 or 3.Therefore, the difference is 3 when ((k+1)^2) crosses a multiple of 1000, and 2 otherwise.So, the first time the difference is 3 is at (k = 31), as we saw. The next time would be when ((k+1)^2) crosses the next multiple of 1000, which is 2000.So, when does ((k+1)^2 geq 2000)?Solving for (k):[(k + 1)^2 geq 2000 implies k + 1 geq sqrt{2000} approx 44.721]So, (k + 1 = 45), so (k = 44). Therefore, at (k = 44), the difference will be 3 again.Wait, let me check:For (k = 44):(n = 1044), (n^2 = (1000 + 44)^2 = 1,000,000 + 88,000 + 1,936 = 1,089,936). Discarding last three digits: 1089.For (k = 45):(n = 1045), (n^2 = (1000 + 45)^2 = 1,000,000 + 90,000 + 2,025 = 1,092,025). Discarding last three digits: 1092.So, the difference between (k = 44) and (k = 45) is 1092 - 1089 = 3.Therefore, the difference is 3 again at (k = 44).So, the AP is broken not only at (k = 32) but also at (k = 45), (k = 56), etc., each time when ((k + 1)^2) crosses a multiple of 1000.Therefore, the first time the AP is broken is at (k = 32), making the first 32 terms an AP. Then, at (k = 45), it's broken again, but the question is only about the first terms forming an AP. So, the first 32 terms are in AP, but the 33rd term breaks it. Therefore, the maximum number of terms forming an AP is 32.Wait, but let me confirm:From (k = 0) to (k = 31), the difference is 2 each time. So, 32 terms.At (k = 32), the difference is 3, so the AP is broken.Therefore, the first 32 terms form an AP, and the 33rd term does not. So, the answer is 32.But wait, let me think about the exact wording again: \\"how many of the first terms in the resulting sequence form an arithmetic progression\\". So, it's asking for the maximum number of terms starting from the first term that form an AP.So, if the first 32 terms are in AP, but term 33 is not, then the answer is 32.But wait, let me check (k = 32) again. Is the term 1065, which is 3 more than 1062. So, yes, the difference is 3, breaking the AP.Therefore, the answer is 32.But wait, let me think about the exact calculation for (k = 32):(n = 1032), (n^2 = 1,065,024). Discarding last three digits: 1065.Yes, that's correct.So, the first 32 terms are in AP, and the 33rd term is not. Therefore, the answer is 32.But wait, let me think about the general case. The difference (a_{k+1} - a_k) is 2 + floor(( (k+1)^2 - k^2 ) / 1000 ). Since (k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1, so floor( (2k + 1)/1000 ). So, when 2k + 1 >= 1000, the floor function becomes 1, making the difference 3.Wait, but 2k + 1 >= 1000 implies k >= 499.5, so k >= 500. So, for k >= 500, the difference becomes 3.Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, let me recast:Wait, actually, the difference is:[a_{k+1} - a_k = 2 + leftlfloor frac{(k+1)^2}{1000} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{k^2}{1000} rightrfloor]But ((k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1). So, the difference in the floor functions is:[leftlfloor frac{(k+1)^2}{1000} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{k^2}{1000} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{k^2 + 2k + 1}{1000} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{k^2}{1000} rightrfloor]This difference is equal to 1 if (2k + 1 geq 1000 times m) for some integer (m), but actually, it's 1 if the fractional part of (k^2 / 1000) plus ( (2k + 1)/1000 ) exceeds 1.Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of when ( (k+1)^2 ) crosses a multiple of 1000.So, the difference is 3 when ( (k+1)^2 ) crosses a multiple of 1000, i.e., when ( (k+1)^2 ) is a multiple of 1000.But 1000 is 10^3, which is 2^3 * 5^3. So, (k+1) must be a multiple of 10^(3/2) = 31.622..., but since (k+1) must be integer, the smallest (k+1) such that ( (k+1)^2 ) is a multiple of 1000 is when (k+1) is a multiple of 10*sqrt(10) ≈ 31.622, but since (k+1) must be integer, the smallest (k+1) is 32, as 32^2 = 1024, which is the first square above 1000.Wait, but 32^2 = 1024, which is not a multiple of 1000, but it's the first square that is greater than 1000. So, the floor function increases by 1 at this point.Therefore, the difference becomes 3 when (k+1 = 32), i.e., (k = 31), as we saw earlier.Similarly, the next time the floor function increases by 1 is when ( (k+1)^2 ) crosses 2000, which happens at (k+1 = 45), since 45^2 = 2025.So, at (k = 44), the difference becomes 3 again.Therefore, the differences are 2 for most terms, but 3 at specific points where ( (k+1)^2 ) crosses a multiple of 1000.Therefore, the first time the difference is 3 is at (k = 31), making the AP break at term 32.So, the first 32 terms form an AP, and then the AP is broken at term 33.Therefore, the answer is 32.But wait, let me think again. If the first 32 terms are in AP, but the 33rd term is not, then the maximum number of terms forming an AP is 32.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the answer is 32.**Final Answer**The number of the first terms forming an arithmetic progression is boxed{32}."},{"question":"As a Spanish cinema enthusiast, you've been closely following the career of director Isabel Coixet since her breakthrough film \\"My Life Without Me,\\" which was released in 2003.

Among Isabel Coixet's films, 40% are in Spanish, and the rest are in other languages. If the number of films in Spanish is two more than the number of films in English, find how many films are in English. Use the solution from the first sub-problem to set up and solve the appropriate equation.","answer":"First, I need to solve the quadratic equation ( n^2 - 7n + 10 = 0 ) to determine the possible number of films Isabel Coixet could have directed. I'll factor the quadratic equation by finding two numbers that multiply to 10 and add up to -7. The numbers -5 and -2 satisfy these conditions, so the equation factors to ( (n - 5)(n - 2) = 0 ). This gives the solutions ( n = 5 ) and ( n = 2 ).Next, I'll use the solutions from the first problem to find out how many of Isabel Coixet's films are in English. If the total number of films is 5, then 40% of them, which is 2 films, are in Spanish. The remaining 60% are in other languages, which is 3 films. According to the problem, the number of films in Spanish is two more than those in English. Setting up the equation ( 2 = E + 2 ), I find that ( E = 0 ), which doesn't make sense in this context.If the total number of films is 2, then 40% of them, which is 0.8 films, are in Spanish. This also doesn't make practical sense since the number of films should be a whole number. Therefore, neither solution from the first problem provides a valid number of films in English. This suggests that there might be an inconsistency in the problem's setup or that additional constraints are needed."},{"question":"A local politician in Brazil is planning to implement a new policy to reduce carbon emissions in the city by promoting electric vehicle (EV) usage.

The politician has allocated 1,000,000 for this purpose, and each charging station costs 50,000.

If the diameter of this circle is 6 meters longer than the width of the rectangular garden, write a quadratic equation to represent the area of the circle in terms of the width of the rectangular garden. What is the area when the width of the garden is at its maximum allowable length from the first problem?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular garden plot. The narrator loves gardens and visualizing scenarios, which is nice. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the problem says that the length of the garden is 3 meters longer than twice its width. Hmm, okay. So if I let the width be something, say, 'w' meters, then the length would be 2w + 3 meters. That makes sense because if the width is, for example, 5 meters, then the length would be 2*5 + 3 = 13 meters. Got it.Now, the next part is about the perimeter. The narrator wants to plant flowers around the perimeter, but the total perimeter must not exceed 54 meters. So, I need to write an inequality for the perimeter in terms of the width and then solve it to find the possible widths.Alright, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). So, substituting the expressions we have, the perimeter would be 2*( (2w + 3) + w ). Let me write that out:P = 2*(2w + 3 + w)Simplify inside the parentheses first: 2w + w is 3w, so that becomes:P = 2*(3w + 3)Multiply through: 2*3w is 6w, and 2*3 is 6. So, P = 6w + 6.But the perimeter must not exceed 54 meters, so the inequality is:6w + 6 ≤ 54Now, I need to solve for 'w'. Let's subtract 6 from both sides:6w + 6 - 6 ≤ 54 - 6Simplifies to:6w ≤ 48Now, divide both sides by 6:6w / 6 ≤ 48 / 6Which gives:w ≤ 8So, the width must be less than or equal to 8 meters. That seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.1. Expressed length in terms of width: 2w + 3. Correct.2. Perimeter formula: 2*(length + width). Correct.3. Substituted and simplified: 2*(3w + 3) = 6w + 6. Correct.4. Set up inequality: 6w + 6 ≤ 54. Correct.5. Solved for w: subtract 6, divide by 6, got w ≤ 8. Correct.Okay, so the first part seems solid. The possible widths are any value up to 8 meters. So, the maximum width is 8 meters.Moving on to the second part. The narrator wants to create a circular flower bed where the diameter is 6 meters longer than the width of the rectangular garden. So, if the width of the rectangle is 'w', then the diameter of the circle is w + 6 meters.They want a quadratic equation representing the area of the circle in terms of the width of the rectangular garden. Hmm, quadratic equation. Let me recall that the area of a circle is A = πr², where r is the radius.But the diameter is given as w + 6, so the radius would be half of that, which is (w + 6)/2. So, substituting into the area formula:A = π * [(w + 6)/2]^2Let me expand that. First, square the radius:[(w + 6)/2]^2 = (w + 6)² / 4So, the area becomes:A = π * (w² + 12w + 36) / 4Simplify that:A = (π/4) * (w² + 12w + 36)So, that's a quadratic equation in terms of 'w'. Let me write it as:A = (π/4)w² + 3πw + 9πBut the problem says to write a quadratic equation, so maybe they just want the expression in terms of 'w' without the π factored out? Let me see. The question says, \\"write a quadratic equation to represent the area of the circle in terms of the width of the rectangular garden.\\" So, perhaps they just want the expression for A in terms of w, which is quadratic.So, A = π*( (w + 6)/2 )² is already quadratic, but if they want it expanded, then it's (π/4)w² + 3πw + 9π. Either way, both are quadratic in form.But let me check if they need it in standard quadratic form, which is ax² + bx + c. So, yes, expanding it as above would give that.Now, the second part of the question is: What is the area when the width of the garden is at its maximum allowable length from the first problem?From the first problem, the maximum width is 8 meters. So, when w = 8, what is the area of the circular flower bed?Let me compute that. First, find the diameter: w + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 meters. So, the radius is 14 / 2 = 7 meters.Then, the area is πr² = π*(7)² = 49π square meters.Alternatively, using the quadratic equation I derived earlier:A = (π/4)w² + 3πw + 9πPlug in w = 8:A = (π/4)*(8)² + 3π*(8) + 9π= (π/4)*64 + 24π + 9π= 16π + 24π + 9π= (16 + 24 + 9)π= 49πSame result. So, that checks out.Let me recap:1. Expressed the perimeter in terms of width, set up the inequality, solved for w, got w ≤ 8.2. Expressed the area of the circle in terms of w, expanded it into a quadratic equation, then substituted w = 8 to find the area is 49π.I think that covers both parts. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, but let me just go through once more.For the first part:- Length = 2w + 3- Perimeter = 2*(length + width) = 2*(2w + 3 + w) = 2*(3w + 3) = 6w + 6- Inequality: 6w + 6 ≤ 54 → 6w ≤ 48 → w ≤ 8. Correct.For the second part:- Diameter = w + 6 → radius = (w + 6)/2- Area = π*(radius)² = π*((w + 6)/2)² = π*(w² + 12w + 36)/4 = (π/4)w² + 3πw + 9π. Correct.- When w = 8: diameter = 14, radius = 7, area = 49π. Correct.Yep, everything seems to add up. I think I'm confident with these answers.**Final Answer**1. The possible widths of the garden are boxed{w leq 8} meters.2. The area of the circular flower bed when the width is at its maximum is boxed{49pi} square meters."},{"question":"As a traditional Chinese Confucianist, you are trying to reconcile your understanding of harmony and balance with the differing beliefs of your loved one. You decide to symbolize this struggle using a balance scale as a metaphor, where the equilibrium represents harmony between your beliefs and theirs.1. On one side of the scale, you have beliefs represented by the polynomial ( P(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - x + 4 ). On the other side, your loved one's beliefs are represented by the polynomial ( Q(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 5 ). Find the expression that represents the difference between your beliefs and your loved one's beliefs.2. To achieve harmony (a balanced scale), the difference found in part 1 must equal zero for some value of ( x ). Solve the equation ( P(x) - Q(x) = 0 ) to find the potential value(s) of ( x ) that represent harmony between your beliefs.","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to reconcile my Confucian beliefs with those of my loved one using a balance scale metaphor. The problem gives me two polynomials, P(x) and Q(x), representing each of our beliefs. I need to find the difference between them and then solve for when that difference equals zero, which would symbolize harmony.Starting with part 1: finding the difference between P(x) and Q(x). I remember that subtracting polynomials involves subtracting their corresponding coefficients. So, I should write out both polynomials and then subtract Q(x) from P(x).Let me write down P(x):P(x) = 2x³ + 3x² - x + 4And Q(x):Q(x) = x³ - 4x² + 6x - 5So, to find P(x) - Q(x), I need to subtract each term of Q(x) from P(x). Let me do that term by term.First, the x³ terms: 2x³ - x³. That should be (2 - 1)x³ = x³.Next, the x² terms: 3x² - (-4x²). Subtracting a negative is like adding, so 3x² + 4x² = 7x².Then, the x terms: -x - 6x. That's (-1 - 6)x = -7x.Lastly, the constant terms: 4 - (-5). Again, subtracting a negative is adding, so 4 + 5 = 9.Putting it all together, the difference P(x) - Q(x) should be:x³ + 7x² - 7x + 9Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs.Starting again:P(x) - Q(x) = (2x³ + 3x² - x + 4) - (x³ - 4x² + 6x - 5)Distribute the negative sign to each term in Q(x):= 2x³ + 3x² - x + 4 - x³ + 4x² - 6x + 5Now, combine like terms:2x³ - x³ = x³3x² + 4x² = 7x²- x - 6x = -7x4 + 5 = 9So yes, that seems correct: x³ + 7x² - 7x + 9.Okay, so part 1 is done. The difference is x³ + 7x² - 7x + 9.Moving on to part 2: solving P(x) - Q(x) = 0, which is x³ + 7x² - 7x + 9 = 0.Hmm, solving a cubic equation. I remember that for polynomials, especially cubics, we can try to factor them or use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible roots.The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, p/q, is such that p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.In this case, the constant term is 9, and the leading coefficient is 1. So possible rational roots are ±1, ±3, ±9.Let me test these one by one.First, x = 1:1³ + 7(1)² - 7(1) + 9 = 1 + 7 - 7 + 9 = 10 ≠ 0.Not a root.x = -1:(-1)³ + 7(-1)² - 7(-1) + 9 = -1 + 7 + 7 + 9 = 22 ≠ 0.Not a root.x = 3:3³ + 7(3)² - 7(3) + 9 = 27 + 63 - 21 + 9 = 78 ≠ 0.Not a root.x = -3:(-3)³ + 7(-3)² - 7(-3) + 9 = -27 + 63 + 21 + 9 = 66 ≠ 0.Not a root.x = 9:9³ + 7(9)² - 7(9) + 9 = 729 + 567 - 63 + 9 = 1242 ≠ 0.Way too big, not a root.x = -9:(-9)³ + 7(-9)² - 7(-9) + 9 = -729 + 567 + 63 + 9 = (-729 + 567) + (63 + 9) = (-162) + 72 = -90 ≠ 0.Not a root.Hmm, none of the rational roots work. That means either the equation has irrational roots or complex roots, or maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.Wait, let me check my calculations again for x = 1 and x = -1, just to be sure.For x = 1:1 + 7 - 7 + 9 = 1 + 7 is 8, 8 -7 is 1, 1 +9 is 10. Correct.x = -1:-1 + 7 + 7 + 9 = (-1 +7) is 6, 6 +7 is 13, 13 +9 is 22. Correct.Hmm, so no rational roots. Maybe I need to use another method. Perhaps factoring by grouping or using the cubic formula.Factoring by grouping: let's see if that's possible.The polynomial is x³ + 7x² -7x +9.Let me group the first two terms and the last two terms:(x³ + 7x²) + (-7x + 9)Factor out x² from the first group: x²(x + 7)Factor out -1 from the second group: -1(7x - 9)Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful because the binomials aren't the same.Alternatively, maybe try a different grouping.Wait, another approach: Maybe use synthetic division or look for a root numerically.Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be rewritten or depressed.Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of depressed cubic.But that might be too complicated. Alternatively, maybe graphing the function to estimate roots.Wait, let's evaluate the polynomial at some points to see where it crosses zero.We have f(x) = x³ + 7x² -7x +9.Compute f(-5):(-5)^3 +7*(-5)^2 -7*(-5) +9 = -125 + 175 +35 +9 = (-125 +175)=50, 50 +35=85, 85 +9=94. So f(-5)=94.f(-4):(-4)^3 +7*(-4)^2 -7*(-4) +9 = -64 + 112 +28 +9 = (-64 +112)=48, 48 +28=76, 76 +9=85. f(-4)=85.f(-3):Earlier, we saw f(-3)=66.f(-2):(-2)^3 +7*(-2)^2 -7*(-2) +9 = -8 +28 +14 +9 = (-8 +28)=20, 20 +14=34, 34 +9=43. f(-2)=43.f(-1)=22 as before.f(0)=0 +0 -0 +9=9.f(1)=10.f(2)=8 +28 -14 +9=8+28=36, 36-14=22, 22+9=31.f(3)=27 +63 -21 +9=78.So, all these values are positive. Hmm, so the function is positive at x=-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0,1,2,3.Wait, that suggests that maybe the function doesn't cross zero? But a cubic must have at least one real root.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating f(-5). Let me double-check.f(-5)= (-5)^3 +7*(-5)^2 -7*(-5) +9= -125 + 7*25 +35 +9= -125 +175 +35 +9= (-125 +175)=50, 50 +35=85, 85 +9=94. Correct.Wait, but if all these points are positive, then maybe the function is always positive? But that can't be, because as x approaches negative infinity, x³ dominates and goes to negative infinity. So, it must cross zero somewhere.Wait, let me check f(-10):f(-10)= (-10)^3 +7*(-10)^2 -7*(-10) +9= -1000 + 700 +70 +9= (-1000 +700)= -300, -300 +70= -230, -230 +9= -221.So f(-10)= -221.So, f(-10)= -221, which is negative, and f(-5)=94, which is positive. So, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root between x=-10 and x=-5.Similarly, let's check f(-6):f(-6)= (-6)^3 +7*(-6)^2 -7*(-6) +9= -216 + 7*36 +42 +9= -216 +252 +42 +9= (-216 +252)=36, 36 +42=78, 78 +9=87.f(-6)=87.So, f(-10)= -221, f(-6)=87. So, a root between -10 and -6.Let me try f(-8):f(-8)= (-8)^3 +7*(-8)^2 -7*(-8) +9= -512 + 7*64 +56 +9= -512 +448 +56 +9= (-512 +448)= -64, -64 +56= -8, -8 +9=1.So, f(-8)=1.Close to zero. So, f(-8)=1, f(-9)=?f(-9)= (-9)^3 +7*(-9)^2 -7*(-9) +9= -729 + 7*81 +63 +9= -729 +567 +63 +9= (-729 +567)= -162, -162 +63= -99, -99 +9= -90.So, f(-9)= -90.So, f(-9)= -90, f(-8)=1. So, a root between x=-9 and x=-8.Let me try f(-8.5):f(-8.5)= (-8.5)^3 +7*(-8.5)^2 -7*(-8.5) +9First, (-8.5)^3 = -614.1257*(-8.5)^2 = 7*(72.25)=505.75-7*(-8.5)=59.5So, adding them up:-614.125 +505.75 +59.5 +9Compute step by step:-614.125 +505.75 = -108.375-108.375 +59.5 = -48.875-48.875 +9 = -39.875So, f(-8.5)= -39.875.Still negative.f(-8.25):(-8.25)^3 +7*(-8.25)^2 -7*(-8.25) +9Compute each term:(-8.25)^3 = (-8.25)*(-8.25)*(-8.25)First, (-8.25)^2 = 68.0625Then, (-8.25)^3 = -8.25 * 68.0625Compute 8 * 68.0625 = 544.50.25 * 68.0625 = 17.015625So, total is - (544.5 +17.015625)= -561.5156257*(-8.25)^2 =7*68.0625=476.4375-7*(-8.25)=57.75So, adding all terms:-561.515625 +476.4375 +57.75 +9Compute step by step:-561.515625 +476.4375 = -85.078125-85.078125 +57.75 = -27.328125-27.328125 +9 = -18.328125So, f(-8.25)= -18.328125.Still negative.f(-8.1):Compute f(-8.1):(-8.1)^3 +7*(-8.1)^2 -7*(-8.1) +9First, (-8.1)^3 = -531.4417*(-8.1)^2 =7*(65.61)=459.27-7*(-8.1)=56.7So, adding up:-531.441 +459.27 +56.7 +9Compute:-531.441 +459.27 = -72.171-72.171 +56.7 = -15.471-15.471 +9 = -6.471So, f(-8.1)= -6.471.Still negative.f(-8.05):(-8.05)^3 +7*(-8.05)^2 -7*(-8.05) +9Compute each term:(-8.05)^3: Let's compute 8.05^3 first.8^3=5120.05^3=0.000125But actually, (8 +0.05)^3 = 8^3 + 3*8^2*0.05 + 3*8*(0.05)^2 + (0.05)^3=512 + 3*64*0.05 + 3*8*0.0025 +0.000125=512 + 9.6 + 0.06 +0.000125=512 +9.6=521.6 +0.06=521.66 +0.000125≈521.660125So, (-8.05)^3≈-521.6601257*(-8.05)^2: First, (-8.05)^2=64.80257*64.8025≈453.6175-7*(-8.05)=56.35So, adding up:-521.660125 +453.6175 +56.35 +9Compute step by step:-521.660125 +453.6175≈-68.042625-68.042625 +56.35≈-11.692625-11.692625 +9≈-2.692625So, f(-8.05)≈-2.6926.Still negative.f(-8.025):Compute f(-8.025):(-8.025)^3 +7*(-8.025)^2 -7*(-8.025) +9First, approximate (-8.025)^3:8.025^3≈(8 +0.025)^3=512 + 3*64*0.025 + 3*8*(0.025)^2 + (0.025)^3=512 + 4.8 + 0.015 +0.000015625≈516.815015625So, (-8.025)^3≈-516.8150156257*(-8.025)^2: (-8.025)^2≈64.4006257*64.400625≈450.804375-7*(-8.025)=56.175Adding up:-516.815015625 +450.804375 +56.175 +9Compute:-516.815015625 +450.804375≈-66.010640625-66.010640625 +56.175≈-9.835640625-9.835640625 +9≈-0.835640625So, f(-8.025)≈-0.8356.Still negative, but closer to zero.f(-8.01):Compute f(-8.01):(-8.01)^3 +7*(-8.01)^2 -7*(-8.01) +9First, (-8.01)^3≈-514.416 (since 8^3=512, 8.01^3≈512 + 3*64*0.01 + 3*8*(0.01)^2 + (0.01)^3≈512 +1.92 +0.0024 +0.000001≈513.922401, so negative is≈-513.922401)7*(-8.01)^2: (-8.01)^2≈64.1601, so 7*64.1601≈449.1207-7*(-8.01)=56.07Adding up:-513.922401 +449.1207 +56.07 +9Compute:-513.922401 +449.1207≈-64.801701-64.801701 +56.07≈-8.731701-8.731701 +9≈0.268299So, f(-8.01)≈0.2683.Positive.So, f(-8.01)≈0.2683, f(-8.025)≈-0.8356.So, the root is between x=-8.025 and x=-8.01.Using linear approximation:Between x1=-8.025, f(x1)= -0.8356x2=-8.01, f(x2)=0.2683We can approximate the root as x ≈ x1 - f(x1)*(x2 -x1)/(f(x2)-f(x1))So, x ≈ -8.025 - (-0.8356)*(0.015)/(0.2683 - (-0.8356))Compute denominator: 0.2683 +0.8356≈1.1039So, x ≈ -8.025 + (0.8356 *0.015)/1.1039Compute numerator: 0.8356 *0.015≈0.012534So, x ≈ -8.025 + 0.012534 /1.1039≈-8.025 +0.01135≈-8.01365So, approximately x≈-8.01365.So, one real root is approximately x≈-8.014.But since it's a cubic, there might be more roots. Let me check the derivative to see the behavior.f'(x)=3x² +14x -7Set f'(x)=0:3x² +14x -7=0Using quadratic formula:x=(-14 ±√(14² -4*3*(-7)))/(2*3)=(-14 ±√(196 +84))/6=(-14 ±√280)/6√280≈16.733So, x=(-14 +16.733)/6≈2.733/6≈0.4555x=(-14 -16.733)/6≈-30.733/6≈-5.122So, critical points at x≈0.4555 and x≈-5.122.So, the function has a local maximum at x≈-5.122 and a local minimum at x≈0.4555.We already saw that f(-5)=94, which is a local maximum, and f(0)=9, which is after the local minimum.So, the function decreases from x=-infty to x≈-5.122, reaching a local max at x≈-5.122, then decreases to a local min at x≈0.4555, then increases to infinity.Given that f(-10)= -221, f(-5)=94, f(0)=9, f(5)=?Wait, f(5)=125 + 175 -35 +9=125+175=300, 300-35=265, 265+9=274.So, f(5)=274.So, the function crosses zero only once, at x≈-8.014, because after that, it goes up to 94 at x=-5, then decreases to 9 at x=0, then increases again. So, only one real root.Therefore, the equation P(x)-Q(x)=0 has one real solution at approximately x≈-8.014, and two complex solutions.But since the problem is about harmony, which is a real-world concept, maybe only the real root is meaningful here.So, the potential value of x that represents harmony is approximately x≈-8.014.But to express it exactly, since it's a cubic, we might need to use the cubic formula, which is quite involved.Alternatively, we can express it in terms of radicals, but that would be complicated.Alternatively, since it's a real root, we can write it as:x = frac{-7 pm sqrt{(frac{7}{3})^2 + frac{2}{3} cdot frac{9}{1}}}{frac{3}{1}}}Wait, no, that's for quadratics. For cubics, it's more complex.Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be transformed into a depressed cubic.Let me try that.Given f(x)=x³ +7x² -7x +9=0.Let me make the substitution x = y - b/(3a). For a general cubic ax³ +bx² +cx +d=0, the substitution is x = y - b/(3a).Here, a=1, b=7, so x = y - 7/3.Substitute into f(x):(y - 7/3)³ +7(y - 7/3)² -7(y -7/3) +9=0Let me expand each term.First term: (y - 7/3)^3= y³ - 3*(7/3)y² + 3*(49/9)y - 343/27= y³ -7y² + (49/3)y -343/27Second term: 7*(y -7/3)^2=7*(y² - (14/3)y +49/9)=7y² - (98/3)y +343/9Third term: -7*(y -7/3)= -7y +49/3Fourth term: +9Now, add all these together:First term: y³ -7y² + (49/3)y -343/27Second term: +7y² - (98/3)y +343/9Third term: -7y +49/3Fourth term: +9Now, combine like terms:y³: y³y²: -7y² +7y²=0y: (49/3)y - (98/3)y -7yConvert -7y to -21/3 y:So, (49/3 -98/3 -21/3)y= (49 -98 -21)/3 y= (-70)/3 yConstants: -343/27 +343/9 +49/3 +9Convert all to 27 denominator:-343/27 + (343*3)/27 + (49*9)/27 + (9*27)/27= -343/27 +1029/27 +441/27 +243/27= (-343 +1029 +441 +243)/27Compute numerator:-343 +1029=686686 +441=11271127 +243=1370So, constants=1370/27Therefore, the equation becomes:y³ - (70/3)y +1370/27=0Multiply through by 27 to eliminate denominators:27y³ - 630y +1370=0So, 27y³ -630y +1370=0This is a depressed cubic of the form t³ + pt + q=0, where p= -630/27= -70/3, q=1370/27.Wait, actually, in the standard form, it's t³ + pt + q=0. So, here, it's y³ - (70/3)y +1370/27=0.So, p= -70/3, q=1370/27.To solve this, we can use the depressed cubic formula:y = sqrt[3]{-q/2 + sqrt{(q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3}} + sqrt[3]{-q/2 - sqrt{(q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3}}Compute discriminant D=(q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3First, compute q/2= (1370/27)/2=1370/54≈25.3704(p/3)= (-70/3)/3= -70/9≈-7.7778(p/3)^3= (-70/9)^3= -343000/729≈-470.4918(q/2)^2= (1370/54)^2≈(25.3704)^2≈643.64So, D≈643.64 + (-470.4918)=643.64 -470.4918≈173.1482Since D>0, one real root and two complex conjugate roots.Compute u= sqrt[3]{-q/2 + sqrt{D}}= sqrt[3]{-1370/54 + sqrt{173.1482}}First, compute -1370/54≈-25.3704sqrt(D)=sqrt(173.1482)≈13.158So, -25.3704 +13.158≈-12.2124So, u= sqrt[3]{-12.2124}≈-2.3Similarly, v= sqrt[3]{-q/2 - sqrt(D)}= sqrt[3]{-25.3704 -13.158}= sqrt[3]{-38.5284}≈-3.38So, y≈u + v≈-2.3 + (-3.38)= -5.68But wait, let's compute more accurately.Compute u= sqrt[3]{-12.2124}Let me find cube root of 12.2124:2^3=8, 3^3=27. So, cube root of 12.2124 is between 2 and3.2.3^3=12.167, which is close to 12.2124.2.3^3=12.1672.31^3=2.31*2.31=5.3361, 5.3361*2.31≈12.32So, cube root of 12.2124 is≈2.305So, u≈-2.305Similarly, v= sqrt[3]{-38.5284}Cube root of 38.5284:3^3=27, 4^3=64. So, between 3 and4.3.3^3=35.9373.4^3=39.304So, 3.4^3=39.304>38.5284So, cube root of 38.5284≈3.38Thus, v≈-3.38So, y≈-2.305 + (-3.38)= -5.685So, y≈-5.685But remember, x = y -7/3≈y -2.3333So, x≈-5.685 -2.3333≈-8.0183Which is close to our earlier approximation of≈-8.014.So, the real root is approximately x≈-8.018.Therefore, the potential value of x that represents harmony is approximately x≈-8.018.But since the problem might expect an exact form, which is complicated, or perhaps just the approximate value.Alternatively, maybe the equation can be factored in some way, but given that none of the rational roots worked, it's likely irreducible over rationals, so we have to leave it in terms of radicals or approximate.Therefore, the solution is x≈-8.018.But to write it exactly, using the cubic formula, it's quite involved, but let me try.From earlier, we have:y = sqrt[3]{-q/2 + sqrt{D}} + sqrt[3]{-q/2 - sqrt{D}}Where q=1370/27, p=-70/3So, q/2=685/27≈25.3704sqrt(D)=sqrt( (685/27)^2 + (-70/9)^3 )Wait, actually, D=(q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3q=1370/27, so q/2=685/27p=-70/3, so p/3= -70/9Thus, D=(685/27)^2 + (-70/9)^3Compute each term:(685/27)^2= (685)^2 / (27)^2=469,225 /729≈643.64(-70/9)^3= -343,000 /729≈-470.49So, D≈643.64 -470.49≈173.15So, sqrt(D)=sqrt(173.15)≈13.158Thus, u= sqrt[3]{-685/27 +13.158}= sqrt[3]{-25.37 +13.158}= sqrt[3]{-12.212}Similarly, v= sqrt[3]{-685/27 -13.158}= sqrt[3]{-25.37 -13.158}= sqrt[3]{-38.528}So, y= u + v≈-2.305 -3.38≈-5.685Then, x= y -7/3≈-5.685 -2.333≈-8.018So, exact form is:x= sqrt[3]{-685/27 + sqrt{(685/27)^2 + (-70/9)^3}} + sqrt[3]{-685/27 - sqrt{(685/27)^2 + (-70/9)^3}} -7/3But that's quite messy. Alternatively, we can write it as:x= sqrt[3]{frac{-1370}{54} + sqrt{left(frac{1370}{54}right)^2 + left(frac{-70}{9}right)^3}} + sqrt[3]{frac{-1370}{54} - sqrt{left(frac{1370}{54}right)^2 + left(frac{-70}{9}right)^3}} - frac{7}{3}But that's still complicated.Alternatively, factor out 1/27:Let me write it as:x= sqrt[3]{frac{-1370 + 27sqrt{(1370)^2 + ( -70*3)^3}}{54}} + sqrt[3]{frac{-1370 - 27sqrt{(1370)^2 + ( -70*3)^3}}{54}} - frac{7}{3}Wait, that might not be helpful.Alternatively, perhaps write the exact form as:x= sqrt[3]{frac{-1370}{54} + sqrt{left(frac{1370}{54}right)^2 + left(frac{-70}{9}right)^3}} + sqrt[3]{frac{-1370}{54} - sqrt{left(frac{1370}{54}right)^2 + left(frac{-70}{9}right)^3}} - frac{7}{3}But this is still quite unwieldy.Given that, perhaps it's better to present the approximate value, x≈-8.018.Alternatively, since the problem might expect an exact form, but given the complexity, maybe it's acceptable to leave it as the real root of the equation x³ +7x² -7x +9=0, approximately x≈-8.018.So, summarizing:1. The difference is x³ +7x² -7x +9.2. The real solution is approximately x≈-8.018.Therefore, the potential value of x that represents harmony is approximately -8.018.**Final Answer**1. The difference between the beliefs is boxed{x^3 + 7x^2 - 7x + 9}.2. The potential value of ( x ) that represents harmony is approximately boxed{-8.018}."},{"question":"A scientist is studying the effect of a new high-protein diet on the running speed of athletes. In her study, she observes that the average running speed ( v ) (in meters per second) of an athlete on this diet can be modeled by the polynomial equation:[ v(t) = -0.2t^2 + 2t + 5 ]where ( t ) is the number of weeks the athlete has been on the diet.1. Determine the number of weeks ( t ) after which the running speed reaches its maximum. What is this maximum speed?2. The scientist wants to know within which time interval the athlete’s speed exceeds 8 meters per second. Solve the inequality ( -0.2t^2 + 2t + 5 > 8 ) to find the range of weeks ( t ) during which the athlete's speed is greater than 8 meters per second.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a scientist studying a high-protein diet's effect on athletes' running speed. The model given is a quadratic equation: v(t) = -0.2t² + 2t + 5. I need to find two things: first, the number of weeks after which the running speed is maximum and what that maximum speed is. Second, I need to figure out during which weeks the athlete's speed exceeds 8 meters per second. Hmm, let's take this step by step.Starting with the first part: finding the maximum speed and the time it occurs. Since this is a quadratic equation in terms of t, and the coefficient of t² is negative (-0.2), I know the parabola opens downward, which means the vertex is the maximum point. So, the vertex will give me both the time t when the speed is maximum and the value of that maximum speed.I remember that for a quadratic equation in the form of at² + bt + c, the t-coordinate of the vertex is given by -b/(2a). Let me write that down. Here, a is -0.2 and b is 2. So plugging into the formula:t = -b/(2a) = -2/(2*(-0.2)) = -2/(-0.4) = 5. So, t is 5 weeks. That means the maximum speed occurs at 5 weeks. Now, to find the maximum speed, I need to plug t = 5 back into the equation v(t).Calculating v(5): v(5) = -0.2*(5)² + 2*(5) + 5. Let's compute each term:-0.2*(25) = -52*5 = 10So, adding them up: -5 + 10 + 5 = 10. So, the maximum speed is 10 meters per second. That seems straightforward.Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. So, t = 5 weeks. Plugging into v(t):-0.2*(5)^2 = -0.2*25 = -52*5 = 10So, -5 + 10 + 5. Hmm, that's 10. Yeah, that's correct. So, the maximum speed is indeed 10 m/s at 5 weeks.Okay, moving on to the second part: solving the inequality -0.2t² + 2t + 5 > 8. So, the scientist wants to know when the speed is above 8 m/s. Let me write that inequality:-0.2t² + 2t + 5 > 8First, I should bring all terms to one side to make it easier to solve. Subtract 8 from both sides:-0.2t² + 2t + 5 - 8 > 0Simplify 5 - 8: that's -3. So, the inequality becomes:-0.2t² + 2t - 3 > 0Hmm, dealing with a quadratic inequality. I think the best approach is to first solve the corresponding equation -0.2t² + 2t - 3 = 0 to find the critical points, and then determine the intervals where the quadratic expression is positive.Let me write the equation:-0.2t² + 2t - 3 = 0It's a quadratic equation, so I can use the quadratic formula. The standard form is at² + bt + c = 0, so here a = -0.2, b = 2, c = -3.Quadratic formula: t = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)Plugging in the values:t = [-2 ± sqrt((2)^2 - 4*(-0.2)*(-3))]/(2*(-0.2))Let me compute discriminant first: b² - 4ac = 4 - 4*(-0.2)*(-3)Compute 4*(-0.2) = -0.8, then -0.8*(-3) = 2.4So, discriminant = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6So, sqrt(1.6). Hmm, sqrt(1.6) is approximately 1.2649, but maybe I can write it as a fraction or exact value. Wait, 1.6 is 8/5, so sqrt(8/5) = (2*sqrt(10))/5 ≈ 1.2649.So, t = [-2 ± (2*sqrt(10)/5)] / (2*(-0.2))Let me compute the denominator first: 2*(-0.2) = -0.4So, t = [-2 ± (2*sqrt(10)/5)] / (-0.4)Let me simplify this. Let's factor out the numerator:First, let me write -2 as -10/5 to have a common denominator with the other term:-2 = -10/5, so:t = [(-10/5) ± (2*sqrt(10)/5)] / (-0.4)Combine the terms in the numerator:[ (-10 ± 2*sqrt(10) ) / 5 ] / (-0.4)Divide by (-0.4) is the same as multiplying by (-1/0.4). Let me compute that:-1/0.4 = -2.5So, t = [ (-10 ± 2*sqrt(10) ) / 5 ] * (-2.5 )Multiply numerator and denominator:First, let's compute (-10 ± 2*sqrt(10)) * (-2.5):= (-10)*(-2.5) ± (2*sqrt(10))*(-2.5)= 25 ∓ 5*sqrt(10)Then, divide by 5:t = (25 ∓ 5*sqrt(10)) / 5 = 5 ∓ sqrt(10)So, the solutions are t = 5 - sqrt(10) and t = 5 + sqrt(10)Compute sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623So, t ≈ 5 - 3.1623 ≈ 1.8377 weeksAnd t ≈ 5 + 3.1623 ≈ 8.1623 weeksSo, the critical points are approximately 1.8377 and 8.1623 weeks.Since the quadratic opens downward (because the coefficient of t² is negative), the quadratic expression -0.2t² + 2t - 3 is positive between the two roots. So, the solution to the inequality -0.2t² + 2t - 3 > 0 is t between 1.8377 and 8.1623.But since t represents weeks, it should be a positive value, so we don't have to worry about negative time.Therefore, the time interval is approximately (1.8377, 8.1623) weeks.But let me express this in exact terms. Since the roots are 5 - sqrt(10) and 5 + sqrt(10), the solution is t ∈ (5 - sqrt(10), 5 + sqrt(10)).So, the athlete's speed exceeds 8 meters per second between approximately 1.84 weeks and 8.16 weeks.Wait, let me confirm this. Since the parabola opens downward, the expression is positive between the two roots. So, yes, that should be correct.Alternatively, I can test a value between the roots to ensure the inequality holds. Let's pick t = 5, which is midway.Compute v(5) = -0.2*(25) + 2*5 + 5 = -5 + 10 + 5 = 10, which is greater than 8. So, that's correct.What about t = 0? v(0) = 5, which is less than 8. So, the inequality doesn't hold before 1.84 weeks.What about t = 10? v(10) = -0.2*(100) + 20 + 5 = -20 + 25 = 5, which is less than 8. So, the inequality doesn't hold after 8.16 weeks.Therefore, the solution is correct.So, summarizing:1. The maximum speed occurs at t = 5 weeks, and the maximum speed is 10 m/s.2. The athlete's speed exceeds 8 m/s between approximately 1.84 weeks and 8.16 weeks.But since the problem asks for the exact values, I should present the exact roots in terms of sqrt(10). So, the time interval is (5 - sqrt(10), 5 + sqrt(10)) weeks.Let me just write down the exact values:5 - sqrt(10) ≈ 1.8377 weeks5 + sqrt(10) ≈ 8.1623 weeksSo, the speed is above 8 m/s from about week 1.84 to week 8.16.I think that covers both parts of the problem.**Final Answer**1. The maximum speed is achieved after boxed{5} weeks, and the maximum speed is boxed{10} meters per second.2. The athlete’s speed exceeds 8 meters per second between boxed{5 - sqrt{10}} weeks and boxed{5 + sqrt{10}} weeks."},{"question":"In a particular game, each of 4 players rolls a standard 6{ }-sided die.

Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand the game setup. There are 4 players, each rolling a standard 6-sided die. The winner is the player who rolls the highest number. If there's a tie for the highest roll, those tied players roll again until someone wins. Hugo is one of these four players, and we need to find the probability that his first roll was a 5, given that he ended up winning the game.So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is:P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)In this case, event A is \\"Hugo's first roll was a 5,\\" and event B is \\"Hugo won the game.\\" So, we need to find P(A|B) = P(Hugo rolled a 5 and won) / P(Hugo won).Therefore, I need to compute two things:1. The probability that Hugo rolled a 5 and won the game.2. The probability that Hugo won the game.Then, I can divide the first by the second to get the desired probability.Let me tackle the second part first: P(Hugo won). This might be a bit involved, so I need to think carefully.To compute the probability that Hugo wins the game, I can consider all possible scenarios where Hugo's roll is higher than the other three players' rolls, or if there's a tie, he eventually wins in the subsequent rolls.But since the problem involves multiple possible rounds (if there's a tie), it might get complicated. However, I recall that in such games, the probability of winning can be calculated by considering the probability that Hugo's roll is strictly higher than the others, plus the probability that there's a tie and then he wins in the subsequent rounds.But maybe there's a smarter way to compute this. Let me think.Alternatively, since all players are symmetric except for Hugo, maybe we can compute the probability that Hugo has the highest roll, considering the possibility of ties.Wait, actually, since all players are rolling independently, the probability that Hugo wins can be calculated by considering his roll and the rolls of the other three players.Let me denote Hugo's roll as H and the other players' rolls as P1, P2, P3.So, the probability that Hugo wins is the probability that H is greater than P1, P2, and P3, or that H equals the maximum of P1, P2, P3, and then he wins in the subsequent tie-breaker.But this seems recursive because if there's a tie, they roll again, so the probability of Hugo winning in the case of a tie is the same as the original probability, but with fewer players.Wait, no. If there's a tie, only the tied players continue rolling. So, if Hugo is tied with, say, k other players, then the probability that he wins from that point is 1/(k+1), since each tied player has an equal chance to win in the subsequent rolls.Therefore, maybe we can model this as follows:The probability that Hugo wins is the sum over all possible values h that Hugo can roll, of the probability that he rolls h and either all other players rolled less than h, or some other players rolled h and then Hugo wins the tie-breaker.So, mathematically, it can be written as:P(Hugo wins) = Σ [P(H = h) * (P(all others < h) + P(at least one other = h) * P(Hugo wins the tie))]But wait, actually, it's more precise to write it as:For each h from 1 to 6, compute the probability that Hugo rolls h, and then compute the probability that all other players rolled less than h, plus the probability that at least one other player rolled h and then Hugo wins the tie-breaker.But the tie-breaker is another round of rolling, so the probability of Hugo winning the tie-breaker is 1/(number of tied players). However, since the number of tied players can vary, we need to consider all possibilities.This seems a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability that Hugo wins by considering the probability that his roll is the maximum, considering the possibility of ties.Wait, another approach: Since all players are identical in terms of rolling, except for Hugo, the probability that Hugo wins is equal to the probability that his roll is at least as high as the others, considering the tie-breakers.But perhaps another way is to note that the probability that Hugo wins is equal to the sum over h=1 to 6 of the probability that Hugo rolls h multiplied by the probability that all other players rolled less than h, plus the probability that at least one other player rolled h and then Hugo wins the tie.But this seems recursive, but maybe we can express it as:P(Hugo wins) = Σ [P(H = h) * ( (5/6)^3 + (1 - (5/6)^3) * (1/4) ) ]Wait, no, that might not be correct.Wait, actually, for each h, the probability that Hugo wins given he rolled h is equal to the probability that all others rolled less than h, plus the probability that at least one other rolled h multiplied by the probability that Hugo wins the tie.But the probability that Hugo wins the tie is 1/(number of tied players). However, the number of tied players can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but since Hugo is one of them, it can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.Wait, no, if Hugo rolled h, the number of tied players is 1 (Hugo) plus the number of other players who also rolled h.So, if k other players rolled h, then the probability that Hugo wins the tie is 1/(k+1).Therefore, for each h, the probability that Hugo wins given he rolled h is:P(win | H = h) = P(all others < h) + Σ [P(exactly k others = h) * (1/(k+1))]Where k ranges from 1 to 3, since there are 3 other players.Therefore, P(Hugo wins) = Σ [P(H = h) * (P(all others < h) + Σ [P(exactly k others = h) * (1/(k+1))]) ]This seems correct.So, let's compute this.First, let's note that P(H = h) = 1/6 for h = 1,2,3,4,5,6.For each h, compute:Term1 = P(all others < h) = ( (h - 1)/6 )^3Term2 = Σ [P(exactly k others = h) * (1/(k+1))], where k = 1,2,3Compute Term2:For each k, P(exactly k others = h) is C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ( (h - 1)/6 )^(3 - k)Therefore, Term2 = Σ [C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ( (h - 1)/6 )^(3 - k) * (1/(k + 1)) ]So, putting it all together:P(Hugo wins) = Σ [ (1/6) * ( (h - 1)^3 / 6^3 + Σ [C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ( (h - 1)/6 )^(3 - k) * (1/(k + 1)) ]) ] for h=1 to 6.This seems a bit involved, but let's compute it step by step.Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way.Wait, another approach: Since all players are symmetric, the probability that Hugo wins is equal to the probability that his roll is the maximum among the four, considering the tie-breakers.But in such cases, the probability that Hugo wins is equal to the sum over h=1 to 6 of [P(H = h) * P(all others <= h) * (1 / (number of players who rolled h))]But this is similar to the previous approach.Wait, actually, this is a standard problem in probability where each player has an equal chance to win in case of a tie, so the probability that Hugo wins is equal to the sum over h=1 to 6 of [P(H = h) * (1 / (1 + number of other players who rolled h))]But actually, that's not quite accurate because the number of other players who rolled h is a random variable.Wait, perhaps we can model it as:For each h, the probability that Hugo wins is equal to the probability that he rolled h and all others rolled less than h, plus the probability that he rolled h and some others rolled h, and then he wins the tie.But this is similar to the initial approach.Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of \\"probability generating functions\\" or \\"linearity of expectation,\\" but I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: The probability that Hugo wins is equal to the expectation over his roll h of the probability that he wins given h.Which is exactly what we have:P(Hugo wins) = E[ P(Hugo wins | H = h) ] = Σ [P(H = h) * P(Hugo wins | H = h) ]So, we need to compute P(Hugo wins | H = h) for each h.As we discussed earlier, P(Hugo wins | H = h) = P(all others < h) + Σ [P(exactly k others = h) * (1/(k + 1))]So, let's compute this for each h.Let me make a table for each h from 1 to 6.Starting with h = 1:P(H = 1) = 1/6P(Hugo wins | H = 1) = P(all others < 1) + Σ [P(exactly k others = 1) * (1/(k + 1))]But P(all others < 1) = 0, since others can't roll less than 1.For k = 1,2,3:P(exactly k others = 1) = C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * (5/6)^(3 - k)But wait, no, since if H = 1, the other players can roll 1 or higher. Wait, no, actually, if H = 1, the other players can roll 1 or higher, but in the term P(exactly k others = 1), it's the probability that exactly k others rolled 1, given that Hugo rolled 1.Wait, actually, no, the other players are rolling independently, so P(exactly k others = 1) is C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * (5/6)^(3 - k)But wait, no, if we're given that Hugo rolled 1, the other players are rolling independently, so yes, that's correct.Therefore, for h = 1:P(Hugo wins | H = 1) = 0 + Σ [C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * (5/6)^(3 - k) * (1/(k + 1)) ] for k = 1,2,3Compute this:For k =1: C(3,1)*(1/6)^1*(5/6)^2*(1/2) = 3*(1/6)*(25/36)*(1/2) = 3*(25/216)*(1/2) = 75/432For k=2: C(3,2)*(1/6)^2*(5/6)^1*(1/3) = 3*(1/36)*(5/6)*(1/3) = 3*(5/216)*(1/3) = 15/648 = 5/216For k=3: C(3,3)*(1/6)^3*(5/6)^0*(1/4) = 1*(1/216)*1*(1/4) = 1/864So, total P(Hugo wins | H=1) = 75/432 + 5/216 + 1/864Convert all to 864 denominator:75/432 = 150/8645/216 = 20/8641/864 = 1/864Total: 150 + 20 + 1 = 171/864 = 19/96 ≈ 0.1979Wait, 171 divided by 864: 171 ÷ 9 = 19, 864 ÷9=96, so yes, 19/96.So, P(Hugo wins | H=1) = 19/96Similarly, we can compute for h=2:P(Hugo wins | H=2) = P(all others < 2) + Σ [P(exactly k others = 2) * (1/(k + 1))]P(all others < 2) = (1/6)^3 = 1/216For k=1,2,3:P(exactly k others = 2) = C(3, k)*(1/6)^k*( (2 -1)/6 )^(3 - k) = C(3, k)*(1/6)^k*(1/6)^(3 - k) = C(3, k)*(1/6)^3Wait, no, wait. If H=2, then the other players can roll 1 or 2. So, P(exactly k others = 2) is C(3, k)*(1/6)^k*( (2 -1)/6 )^(3 - k) ?Wait, no, actually, if H=2, the other players can roll 1 or 2. So, the probability that another player rolls less than 2 is 1/6, and rolls equal to 2 is 1/6.Wait, no, actually, the die is 6-sided, so if H=2, the other players can roll 1,2,3,4,5,6. So, P(other player rolls <2) = 1/6, P(other player rolls =2) = 1/6, and P(other player rolls >2) = 4/6.But in the term P(exactly k others =2), it's the probability that exactly k others rolled 2, and the rest rolled something else (but not necessarily less than 2, just not equal to 2). Wait, no, actually, in the term P(exactly k others =2), it's the probability that exactly k others rolled 2, regardless of what the others rolled, as long as they didn't roll 2.Wait, no, actually, no. If we're given that Hugo rolled 2, the other players can roll anything, but in the term P(exactly k others =2), it's the probability that exactly k of the other three rolled 2, and the remaining 3 - k rolled something else (could be less than 2 or greater than 2). But in the context of P(Hugo wins | H=2), we need to consider the cases where others rolled less than 2, equal to 2, or greater than 2.Wait, actually, no. Because in the initial roll, if others rolled greater than 2, then Hugo cannot win because someone rolled higher. So, actually, in the term P(Hugo wins | H=2), we need to consider that all others rolled <=2, because if someone rolled higher than 2, Hugo cannot win on the first round, and the game would have continued with the higher rolls.Wait, hold on, this complicates things.I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I considered P(Hugo wins | H = h), I didn't account for the fact that if any other player rolled higher than h, then Hugo cannot win in that round, and the game would proceed with the higher rolls.Therefore, my initial approach was incorrect because I didn't consider that if others rolled higher than h, Hugo cannot win, so those cases should not be included in the probability.Therefore, I need to adjust my approach.So, actually, P(Hugo wins | H = h) is equal to the probability that all other players rolled <= h, and then among those who rolled h, Hugo wins the tie.Therefore, P(Hugo wins | H = h) = P(all others <= h) * [1 / (1 + number of others who rolled h)]But since the number of others who rolled h is a random variable, we need to compute the expectation.So, more precisely:P(Hugo wins | H = h) = Σ [P(exactly k others = h) * P(all others <= h | exactly k others = h) * (1 / (k + 1))]Wait, no, actually, if exactly k others rolled h, then all others rolled <= h, so P(all others <= h | exactly k others = h) = 1, because if exactly k others rolled h, the rest rolled less than h.Wait, no, actually, if exactly k others rolled h, the remaining 3 - k rolled less than h. So, in that case, all others rolled <= h.Therefore, P(Hugo wins | H = h) = Σ [P(exactly k others = h) * (1 / (k + 1))]But we also need to consider that if any other player rolled higher than h, then Hugo cannot win, so those cases are excluded.Wait, so actually, P(Hugo wins | H = h) is equal to the probability that all others rolled <= h, multiplied by the probability that Hugo wins the tie among those who rolled h.Therefore, P(Hugo wins | H = h) = P(all others <= h) * [1 / (1 + number of others who rolled h)]But since the number of others who rolled h is a random variable, we need to compute the expectation.So, more precisely:P(Hugo wins | H = h) = E[1 / (1 + K) | all others <= h], where K is the number of other players who rolled h.But K is a random variable with distribution:P(K = k) = C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ((h - 1)/6)^(3 - k), for k = 0,1,2,3But since we are given that all others rolled <= h, which is equivalent to all others rolled <= h, so the conditional probability is:P(K = k | all others <= h) = [C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ((h - 1)/6)^(3 - k)] / [(h/6)^3]Because the total probability that all others rolled <= h is (h/6)^3.Therefore, P(Hugo wins | H = h) = Σ [P(K = k | all others <= h) * (1 / (k + 1))]So, putting it all together:P(Hugo wins | H = h) = Σ [C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ((h - 1)/6)^(3 - k) / (h/6)^3 * (1 / (k + 1))]Simplify this expression:First, note that (h/6)^3 is the denominator, so:= Σ [C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ((h - 1)/6)^(3 - k) / (h^3 / 6^3) * (1 / (k + 1))]Simplify the fractions:= Σ [C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ((h - 1)/6)^(3 - k) * (6^3 / h^3) * (1 / (k + 1))]= Σ [C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ((h - 1)/6)^(3 - k) * (216 / h^3) * (1 / (k + 1))]Simplify further:= (216 / h^3) * Σ [C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ((h - 1)/6)^(3 - k) * (1 / (k + 1))]Let me factor out the constants:= (216 / h^3) * Σ [C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ((h - 1)/6)^(3 - k) * (1 / (k + 1))]This seems complicated, but perhaps we can compute this for each h.Alternatively, maybe we can find a generating function or use combinatorial identities.Wait, let me consider that:Σ [C(3, k) * (1/6)^k * ((h - 1)/6)^(3 - k) * (1 / (k + 1))] for k=0 to 3But k=0: C(3,0)*(1/6)^0*((h-1)/6)^3*(1/1) = ((h - 1)/6)^3k=1: C(3,1)*(1/6)^1*((h - 1)/6)^2*(1/2) = 3*(1/6)*((h - 1)/6)^2*(1/2)k=2: C(3,2)*(1/6)^2*((h - 1)/6)^1*(1/3) = 3*(1/6)^2*((h - 1)/6)*(1/3)k=3: C(3,3)*(1/6)^3*((h - 1)/6)^0*(1/4) = (1/6)^3*(1/4)Therefore, the sum becomes:= ((h - 1)/6)^3 + 3*(1/6)*((h - 1)/6)^2*(1/2) + 3*(1/6)^2*((h - 1)/6)*(1/3) + (1/6)^3*(1/4)Let me compute each term:Term1: ((h - 1)/6)^3Term2: 3*(1/6)*((h - 1)/6)^2*(1/2) = (3/12)*((h - 1)/6)^2 = (1/4)*((h - 1)/6)^2Term3: 3*(1/6)^2*((h - 1)/6)*(1/3) = (3/3)*(1/6)^2*((h - 1)/6) = (1/36)*((h - 1)/6)Term4: (1/6)^3*(1/4) = (1/216)*(1/4) = 1/864So, putting it all together:Sum = ((h - 1)^3)/216 + ((h - 1)^2)/4*1/36 + ((h - 1))/36*1/6 + 1/864Wait, let me compute each term with denominator 864:Term1: ((h - 1)^3)/216 = 4*(h - 1)^3 / 864Term2: ((h - 1)^2)/4*1/36 = ((h - 1)^2)/144 = 6*(h - 1)^2 / 864Term3: ((h - 1))/36*1/6 = ((h - 1))/216 = 4*(h - 1)/864Term4: 1/864So, total Sum = [4*(h - 1)^3 + 6*(h - 1)^2 + 4*(h - 1) + 1] / 864Wait, that numerator looks familiar. Let me see:4*(h - 1)^3 + 6*(h - 1)^2 + 4*(h - 1) + 1This resembles the expansion of (h)^3, but let's check:Wait, (h)^3 = (h - 1 + 1)^3 = (h - 1)^3 + 3*(h - 1)^2 + 3*(h - 1) + 1But our numerator is 4*(h - 1)^3 + 6*(h - 1)^2 + 4*(h - 1) + 1, which is different.Wait, perhaps it's the expansion of something else.Wait, 4*(h - 1)^3 + 6*(h - 1)^2 + 4*(h - 1) + 1Let me factor this:Let me set x = h - 1, then the numerator becomes 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1Hmm, 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1. Let me see if this factors.Try x = -1: 4*(-1)^3 + 6*(-1)^2 + 4*(-1) + 1 = -4 + 6 - 4 + 1 = -1 ≠ 0x = -1/2: 4*(-1/2)^3 + 6*(-1/2)^2 + 4*(-1/2) + 1 = 4*(-1/8) + 6*(1/4) + (-2) + 1 = (-0.5) + 1.5 - 2 + 1 = 0So, x = -1/2 is a root. Therefore, (x + 1/2) is a factor.Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.Divide 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 by (x + 1/2).Using synthetic division:-1/2 | 4   6   4   1Multiply -1/2 by 4 = -2, add to 6: 4Multiply -1/2 by 4 = -2, add to 4: 2Multiply -1/2 by 2 = -1, add to 1: 0So, the polynomial factors as (x + 1/2)(4x^2 + 4x + 2)But 4x^2 + 4x + 2 doesn't factor nicely. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe it's equal to (2x + 1)^3?Compute (2x + 1)^3 = 8x^3 + 12x^2 + 6x + 1, which is not the same.Wait, 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 is equal to (x + 1)^2*(4x + 1). Let me check:(x + 1)^2*(4x + 1) = (x^2 + 2x + 1)*(4x + 1) = 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x^2 + 2x + 4x + 1 = 4x^3 + 9x^2 + 6x + 1, which is not the same.Wait, close but not quite. Maybe another factorization.Alternatively, perhaps it's equal to (2x + 1)^2*(x + 1). Let's see:(2x + 1)^2*(x + 1) = (4x^2 + 4x + 1)*(x + 1) = 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 4x^2 + 4x + 1 = 4x^3 + 8x^2 + 5x + 1, which is not equal.Hmm, maybe it's not factorable in a nice way. So, perhaps I can leave it as is.Therefore, Sum = [4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1]/864, where x = h - 1.Therefore, going back:P(Hugo wins | H = h) = (216 / h^3) * [4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1]/864Simplify:216 / h^3 * [4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1] / 864 = [4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1] / (4h^3)Because 216 / 864 = 1/4.So, P(Hugo wins | H = h) = [4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1] / (4h^3), where x = h - 1.Therefore, substituting x = h - 1:= [4(h - 1)^3 + 6(h - 1)^2 + 4(h - 1) + 1] / (4h^3)Let me compute this for each h from 1 to 6.Starting with h=1:x = 0Numerator: 4*0 + 6*0 + 4*0 + 1 = 1Denominator: 4*1^3 = 4So, P(Hugo wins | H=1) = 1/4 = 0.25Wait, earlier I had 19/96 ≈ 0.1979, which is different. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong, and this is the correct way.Wait, let me check h=1:If Hugo rolled 1, then all others must have rolled <=1, which is only 1. So, the probability that all others rolled <=1 is (1/6)^3 = 1/216.But in this case, the number of others who rolled 1 is a random variable K, so the probability that Hugo wins is E[1/(K + 1)], where K ~ Binomial(3, 1/6).Wait, but actually, since all others rolled <=1, which is only 1, so K is the number of others who rolled 1, which is Binomial(3, 1/6).Therefore, P(Hugo wins | H=1) = E[1/(K + 1)] where K ~ Binomial(3, 1/6)But computing E[1/(K + 1)] is non-trivial, but perhaps we can compute it directly.E[1/(K + 1)] = Σ [P(K = k) * 1/(k + 1)] for k=0,1,2,3Where P(K = k) = C(3, k)*(1/6)^k*(5/6)^(3 - k)Wait, no, actually, given that all others rolled <=1, which is only 1, so actually, the probability that others rolled 1 is 1/6, and rolled less than 1 is 0, so actually, given that others rolled <=1, the conditional probability that they rolled 1 is 1, since they can't roll less than 1.Wait, this is getting confusing.Wait, actually, if Hugo rolled 1, the other players can roll 1 or higher. But in the term P(Hugo wins | H=1), we need to consider that all others rolled <=1, which is only 1, because rolling higher than 1 would mean someone else has a higher roll, so Hugo cannot win.Therefore, given that Hugo rolled 1, the only way he can win is if all others also rolled 1, and then he wins the tie-breaker.Wait, no, actually, if Hugo rolled 1, and others rolled 1, then they tie, and they roll again. But if others rolled higher than 1, Hugo cannot win.Therefore, actually, P(Hugo wins | H=1) is equal to the probability that all others rolled 1, times the probability that Hugo wins the tie, plus the probability that at least one other rolled higher than 1, times 0.But wait, if any other rolled higher than 1, Hugo cannot win, so only if all others rolled 1, Hugo can potentially win.Therefore, P(Hugo wins | H=1) = P(all others =1) * P(Hugo wins the tie)P(all others =1) = (1/6)^3 = 1/216P(Hugo wins the tie) = 1/4, since there are 4 players tied.Therefore, P(Hugo wins | H=1) = (1/216) * (1/4) = 1/864 ≈ 0.001157But this contradicts the earlier result of 1/4.Wait, now I'm confused.Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I didn't consider that if others rolled higher than h, Hugo cannot win, so those cases are excluded.Therefore, actually, P(Hugo wins | H = h) is equal to the probability that all others rolled <= h, times the probability that Hugo wins the tie among those who rolled h.Therefore, P(Hugo wins | H = h) = P(all others <= h) * E[1 / (K + 1)], where K is the number of others who rolled h.But P(all others <= h) = (h/6)^3And E[1 / (K + 1)] is the expectation over K ~ Binomial(3, 1/h), but actually, given that others rolled <= h, the probability that they rolled h is 1/h, since they can roll 1 to h.Wait, no, actually, given that others rolled <= h, the probability that they rolled h is 1/h, because each has h possible outcomes.Wait, actually, no. Given that others rolled <= h, the probability that a specific other player rolled h is 1/h, because there are h possible outcomes (1 to h), each equally likely.Therefore, K ~ Binomial(3, 1/h)Therefore, E[1 / (K + 1)] is the expectation of 1/(K + 1) where K ~ Binomial(3, 1/h)This is a known expectation, but it's not straightforward.However, there is a formula for E[1/(K + 1)] when K ~ Binomial(n, p):E[1/(K + 1)] = (1 - (1 - p)^{n + 1}) / (p(n + 1))This is a known result.So, applying this formula:E[1/(K + 1)] = [1 - (1 - 1/h)^{4}] / [ (1/h) * 4 ]Simplify:= [1 - ( (h - 1)/h )^4 ] / (4/h )= h/4 * [1 - ( (h - 1)/h )^4 ]Therefore, P(Hugo wins | H = h) = (h/6)^3 * [ h/4 * (1 - ( (h - 1)/h )^4 ) ]Simplify:= (h^3 / 6^3) * (h / 4) * [1 - ( (h - 1)/h )^4 ]= (h^4 / (4 * 6^3)) * [1 - ( (h - 1)/h )^4 ]= (h^4 / 864) * [1 - ( (h - 1)^4 / h^4 ) ]= (h^4 / 864) - ( (h - 1)^4 / 864 )= [ h^4 - (h - 1)^4 ] / 864Therefore, P(Hugo wins | H = h) = [ h^4 - (h - 1)^4 ] / 864Wow, that's a neat result!So, now, we can compute P(Hugo wins | H = h) for each h:For h=1:[1^4 - 0^4]/864 = (1 - 0)/864 = 1/864 ≈ 0.001157For h=2:[16 - 1]/864 = 15/864 = 5/288 ≈ 0.01736For h=3:[81 - 16]/864 = 65/864 ≈ 0.07523For h=4:[256 - 81]/864 = 175/864 ≈ 0.2025For h=5:[625 - 256]/864 = 369/864 = 123/288 ≈ 0.4271For h=6:[1296 - 625]/864 = 671/864 ≈ 0.7764Wait, let me check h=6:[6^4 - 5^4] = 1296 - 625 = 671Yes, so 671/864 ≈ 0.7764Wait, but this seems high. If Hugo rolled a 6, the probability he wins is 671/864 ≈ 0.7764, which is about 77.64%. That seems plausible because rolling a 6 is the highest possible, so he has a high chance to win.Similarly, for h=5, it's 369/864 ≈ 0.4271, which is about 42.71%, which also seems reasonable.Okay, so now, having P(Hugo wins | H = h) for each h, we can compute P(Hugo wins) as:P(Hugo wins) = Σ [P(H = h) * P(Hugo wins | H = h) ] for h=1 to 6Since P(H = h) = 1/6 for each h, we have:P(Hugo wins) = (1/6) * Σ [ P(Hugo wins | H = h) ] for h=1 to 6Compute the sum:Sum = 1/864 + 15/864 + 65/864 + 175/864 + 369/864 + 671/864Compute numerator:1 + 15 = 1616 + 65 = 8181 + 175 = 256256 + 369 = 625625 + 671 = 1296So, Sum = 1296 / 864 = 1.5Therefore, P(Hugo wins) = (1/6) * 1.5 = (1/6)*(3/2) = 1/4 = 0.25Wait, that's interesting. So, the probability that Hugo wins the game is 1/4.That makes sense because there are four players, each with equal chance to win, assuming no bias. So, symmetry suggests that each player has a 1/4 chance to win.Therefore, P(Hugo wins) = 1/4.Now, going back to the original problem, we need to compute P(Hugo rolled a 5 | Hugo won). Using conditional probability:P(H=5 | Hugo won) = P(H=5 and Hugo won) / P(Hugo won)We already know P(Hugo won) = 1/4.Now, we need to compute P(H=5 and Hugo won). This is equal to P(Hugo won | H=5) * P(H=5)From earlier, P(Hugo wins | H=5) = 369/864And P(H=5) = 1/6Therefore, P(H=5 and Hugo won) = (369/864) * (1/6) = 369 / 5184Simplify this fraction:Divide numerator and denominator by 3:369 ÷ 3 = 1235184 ÷ 3 = 1728123 and 1728: 123 ÷ 3 = 41, 1728 ÷ 3 = 576So, 41/576Therefore, P(H=5 | Hugo won) = (41/576) / (1/4) = (41/576) * 4 = 41/144 ≈ 0.2847So, the probability is 41/144, which is option C.Wait, let me confirm:We had P(Hugo wins | H=5) = 369/864Multiply by P(H=5) = 1/6: 369/864 * 1/6 = 369/5184Simplify:Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 123/1728Again by 3: 41/576Then, divide by P(Hugo won) = 1/4: (41/576)/(1/4) = 41/144Yes, that's correct.Therefore, the answer is 41/144, which is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"A railcar manufacturer is designing a new model of a railcar that is capable of carrying more cargo while maintaining efficiency. The railcar can be modeled as a rectangular prism with a length that is 4 meters longer than its width, and a height that is half of its width. The total volume of the railcar is 800 cubic meters.1. Set up a polynomial equation to represent the volume of the railcar in terms of its width, ( w ), and solve for the width of the railcar.2. Once the width is found, calculate the surface area of the railcar using the dimensions derived from the width. The surface area, ( A ), of a rectangular prism is calculated by the formula ( A = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh ), where ( l ) is the length, ( w ) is the width, and ( h ) is the height.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a railcar manufacturer designing a new model. The railcar is modeled as a rectangular prism, which is like a box shape. The problem gives me some relationships between the dimensions and the volume, and then asks me to find the width and then the surface area. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the problem says the railcar can be modeled as a rectangular prism. So, it has length, width, and height. The length is 4 meters longer than its width. Let me denote the width as ( w ). So, the length ( l ) would be ( w + 4 ). Got that.Next, the height is half of its width. So, if the width is ( w ), then the height ( h ) is ( frac{w}{2} ). That makes sense.The total volume of the railcar is given as 800 cubic meters. Volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying length, width, and height. So, the formula is ( V = l times w times h ). Plugging in the expressions I have for length and height in terms of width, the volume equation becomes:( V = (w + 4) times w times left( frac{w}{2} right) )Since the volume is 800, I can set up the equation:( (w + 4) times w times left( frac{w}{2} right) = 800 )Let me simplify this equation step by step. First, multiply ( w ) and ( frac{w}{2} ):( w times frac{w}{2} = frac{w^2}{2} )So, now the equation is:( (w + 4) times frac{w^2}{2} = 800 )To make it easier, I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:( (w + 4) times w^2 = 1600 )Expanding the left side, I get:( w^3 + 4w^2 = 1600 )Now, bringing 1600 to the left side to set the equation to zero:( w^3 + 4w^2 - 1600 = 0 )So, that's the polynomial equation representing the volume in terms of width. Now, I need to solve for ( w ).Hmm, solving a cubic equation can be tricky. Maybe I can try to factor it or use the rational root theorem. Let me see if there are any integer roots. The rational roots would be factors of 1600 divided by factors of 1 (the leading coefficient). So, possible roots could be ±1, ±2, ±4, ±5, ±8, ±10, etc. Let me test some of these.Let me try ( w = 10 ):( 10^3 + 4(10)^2 - 1600 = 1000 + 400 - 1600 = 1400 - 1600 = -200 ). Not zero.How about ( w = 12 ):( 12^3 + 4(12)^2 - 1600 = 1728 + 576 - 1600 = 2304 - 1600 = 704 ). Still not zero.Wait, maybe ( w = 10 ) was too low, ( w = 12 ) is too high. Let me try ( w = 11 ):( 11^3 + 4(11)^2 - 1600 = 1331 + 484 - 1600 = 1815 - 1600 = 215 ). Still positive.Hmm, so between 10 and 11, the function goes from -200 to 215. So, the root is somewhere between 10 and 11. Maybe I can use the Newton-Raphson method or just approximate it.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check.The volume is length × width × height. Length is ( w + 4 ), width is ( w ), height is ( frac{w}{2} ). So, volume is ( (w + 4) times w times frac{w}{2} ). That simplifies to ( frac{w^3 + 4w^2}{2} ). Setting that equal to 800, so ( frac{w^3 + 4w^2}{2} = 800 ), which leads to ( w^3 + 4w^2 = 1600 ). That seems correct.Since it's a cubic equation, maybe I can use synthetic division or graphing to estimate the root. Alternatively, I can use trial and error with decimal values.Let me try ( w = 10 ): result was -200.( w = 10.5 ):( 10.5^3 + 4(10.5)^2 - 1600 )Calculating ( 10.5^3 ): 10.5 × 10.5 = 110.25; 110.25 × 10.5 ≈ 1157.625( 4(10.5)^2 = 4 × 110.25 = 441 )So total: 1157.625 + 441 = 1598.625Subtract 1600: 1598.625 - 1600 = -1.375So, at ( w = 10.5 ), the value is approximately -1.375.Close to zero. Let's try ( w = 10.51 ):( 10.51^3 + 4(10.51)^2 - 1600 )First, ( 10.51^2 = 110.4601 )Then, ( 10.51^3 = 10.51 × 110.4601 ≈ 10.51 × 110.46 ≈ Let's compute 10 × 110.46 = 1104.6, 0.51 × 110.46 ≈ 56.3346. So total ≈ 1104.6 + 56.3346 ≈ 1160.9346Then, ( 4(10.51)^2 = 4 × 110.4601 ≈ 441.8404 )Adding them: 1160.9346 + 441.8404 ≈ 1602.775Subtract 1600: 1602.775 - 1600 = 2.775So, at ( w = 10.51 ), the value is approximately +2.775So, between 10.5 and 10.51, the function crosses zero.We have at ( w = 10.5 ): -1.375At ( w = 10.51 ): +2.775We can use linear approximation to estimate the root.The change in ( w ) is 0.01, and the change in function value is 2.775 - (-1.375) = 4.15We need to find ( Delta w ) such that ( f(w) = 0 ). Starting from ( w = 10.5 ), ( f(w) = -1.375 ). We need to cover 1.375 to reach zero.So, ( Delta w = (1.375 / 4.15) × 0.01 ≈ (0.3313) × 0.01 ≈ 0.003313 )So, approximate root is ( 10.5 + 0.003313 ≈ 10.5033 )So, approximately 10.5033 meters.Let me check ( w = 10.5033 ):First, ( w^3 = (10.5033)^3 ). Let me compute 10.5^3 = 1157.625. Now, 10.5033 is 10.5 + 0.0033.Using binomial approximation:( (10.5 + 0.0033)^3 ≈ 10.5^3 + 3×10.5^2×0.0033 + 3×10.5×(0.0033)^2 + (0.0033)^3 )Compute each term:1. ( 10.5^3 = 1157.625 )2. ( 3×10.5^2×0.0033 = 3×110.25×0.0033 ≈ 3×0.363825 ≈ 1.091475 )3. ( 3×10.5×(0.0033)^2 ≈ 3×10.5×0.00001089 ≈ 3×0.000114345 ≈ 0.000343 )4. ( (0.0033)^3 ≈ 0.0000000359 )Adding them up: 1157.625 + 1.091475 ≈ 1158.716475 + 0.000343 ≈ 1158.716818 + 0.0000000359 ≈ 1158.716818Similarly, ( 4w^2 = 4×(10.5033)^2 ). Compute ( (10.5033)^2 ≈ 110.25 + 2×10.5×0.0033 + (0.0033)^2 ≈ 110.25 + 0.0693 + 0.00001089 ≈ 110.31931089 )Then, ( 4×110.31931089 ≈ 441.27724356 )So, total ( w^3 + 4w^2 ≈ 1158.716818 + 441.27724356 ≈ 1600.0 )Wow, that's really close. So, ( w ≈ 10.5033 ) meters.So, approximately 10.5033 meters is the width. Let me round this to a reasonable decimal place, maybe two decimal places: 10.50 meters.But let me check with ( w = 10.50 ):( w^3 = 10.5^3 = 1157.625 )( 4w^2 = 4×110.25 = 441 )Total: 1157.625 + 441 = 1598.625Which is 1.375 less than 1600. So, to get to 1600, we need a slightly higher ( w ). So, 10.5033 is a better approximation.But for practical purposes, maybe 10.5 meters is sufficient, but since the question didn't specify the precision, perhaps we can present it as 10.5 meters, but considering the exact value, it's approximately 10.5033 meters.Alternatively, maybe I can express it as an exact value, but since it's a cubic equation, it might not have a nice exact form. So, probably, we can leave it as a decimal.So, the width is approximately 10.5033 meters.Now, moving on to part 2: calculating the surface area.First, let's note the dimensions:Width ( w ≈ 10.5033 ) metersLength ( l = w + 4 ≈ 10.5033 + 4 = 14.5033 ) metersHeight ( h = frac{w}{2} ≈ frac{10.5033}{2} ≈ 5.25165 ) metersThe surface area ( A ) of a rectangular prism is given by:( A = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh )Let me compute each term:First, ( lw = 14.5033 × 10.5033 ). Let me compute that:14 × 10 = 14014 × 0.5033 ≈ 7.04620.5033 × 10 ≈ 5.0330.5033 × 0.5033 ≈ 0.2533Adding all together: 140 + 7.0462 + 5.033 + 0.2533 ≈ 152.3325Wait, that's not the right way. Actually, 14.5033 × 10.5033 can be computed as:Let me write it as (14 + 0.5033) × (10 + 0.5033) = 14×10 + 14×0.5033 + 0.5033×10 + 0.5033×0.5033Which is 140 + 7.0462 + 5.033 + 0.2533 ≈ 140 + 7.0462 = 147.0462 + 5.033 = 152.0792 + 0.2533 ≈ 152.3325So, ( lw ≈ 152.3325 ) square metersNext, ( lh = 14.5033 × 5.25165 ). Let me compute this:14 × 5 = 7014 × 0.25165 ≈ 3.52310.5033 × 5 ≈ 2.51650.5033 × 0.25165 ≈ 0.1266Adding them up: 70 + 3.5231 = 73.5231 + 2.5165 = 76.0396 + 0.1266 ≈ 76.1662So, ( lh ≈ 76.1662 ) square metersLastly, ( wh = 10.5033 × 5.25165 ). Let me compute this:10 × 5 = 5010 × 0.25165 ≈ 2.51650.5033 × 5 ≈ 2.51650.5033 × 0.25165 ≈ 0.1266Adding them up: 50 + 2.5165 = 52.5165 + 2.5165 = 55.033 + 0.1266 ≈ 55.1596So, ( wh ≈ 55.1596 ) square metersNow, plugging these into the surface area formula:( A = 2×152.3325 + 2×76.1662 + 2×55.1596 )Compute each term:2×152.3325 = 304.6652×76.1662 = 152.33242×55.1596 = 110.3192Now, add them together:304.665 + 152.3324 = 457.0 (approximately) + 110.3192 ≈ 567.3192So, the surface area is approximately 567.32 square meters.Wait, let me check the calculations again because when I computed lw, lh, wh, I approximated each multiplication, which might have introduced some error. Maybe I should compute each term more accurately.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact expressions without approximating too early.Let me try that.Given ( w ≈ 10.5033 ), ( l = w + 4 ≈ 14.5033 ), ( h = w/2 ≈ 5.25165 )Compute each product:1. ( lw = (w + 4)w = w^2 + 4w ). Since ( w ≈ 10.5033 ), ( w^2 ≈ 110.3193 ), so ( lw ≈ 110.3193 + 4×10.5033 ≈ 110.3193 + 42.0132 ≈ 152.3325 ). So, same as before.2. ( lh = (w + 4) × (w/2) = (w^2 + 4w)/2 ≈ (110.3193 + 42.0132)/2 ≈ 152.3325 / 2 ≈ 76.16625 ). Same as before.3. ( wh = w × (w/2) = w^2 / 2 ≈ 110.3193 / 2 ≈ 55.15965 ). Same as before.So, the products are accurate.Thus, surface area:( 2×152.3325 = 304.665 )( 2×76.16625 = 152.3325 )( 2×55.15965 = 110.3193 )Adding them together:304.665 + 152.3325 = 457.0 (exactly 457.0) + 110.3193 ≈ 567.3193So, approximately 567.32 square meters.But let me check if I can express the surface area in terms of ( w ) without approximating ( w ). Since ( w ) is a root of ( w^3 + 4w^2 - 1600 = 0 ), maybe I can find an exact expression for the surface area.But that might complicate things. Alternatively, since we have an approximate value for ( w ), 10.5033, which gives us the surface area as approximately 567.32.Wait, but let me see if I can express the surface area in terms of ( w ) without plugging in the approximate value.Surface area ( A = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh )We have ( l = w + 4 ), ( h = w/2 )So, substituting:( A = 2(w + 4)w + 2(w + 4)(w/2) + 2w(w/2) )Simplify each term:1. ( 2(w + 4)w = 2w^2 + 8w )2. ( 2(w + 4)(w/2) = (w + 4)w = w^2 + 4w )3. ( 2w(w/2) = w^2 )So, adding all together:( 2w^2 + 8w + w^2 + 4w + w^2 = (2w^2 + w^2 + w^2) + (8w + 4w) = 4w^2 + 12w )So, the surface area simplifies to ( 4w^2 + 12w )That's interesting. So, instead of calculating each term separately, I can express the surface area as ( 4w^2 + 12w ). That might make the calculation easier.Given that ( w ≈ 10.5033 ), let's compute ( 4w^2 + 12w ):First, compute ( w^2 ≈ 110.3193 )Then, ( 4w^2 ≈ 4 × 110.3193 ≈ 441.2772 )Next, ( 12w ≈ 12 × 10.5033 ≈ 126.0396 )Adding them together: 441.2772 + 126.0396 ≈ 567.3168Which is approximately 567.32 square meters, same as before.So, that's consistent.Therefore, the surface area is approximately 567.32 square meters.But let me check if I can find an exact expression for the surface area in terms of the volume equation.We know that ( w^3 + 4w^2 = 1600 ). So, ( w^3 = 1600 - 4w^2 )But in the surface area, we have ( 4w^2 + 12w ). Hmm, not directly related, but perhaps we can express it differently.Alternatively, maybe I can leave the surface area in terms of ( w ) as ( 4w^2 + 12w ), but since we have ( w ) approximately, it's fine to compute the numerical value.So, summarizing:1. The polynomial equation is ( w^3 + 4w^2 - 1600 = 0 ), and solving it gives ( w ≈ 10.5033 ) meters.2. The surface area is ( 4w^2 + 12w ≈ 567.32 ) square meters.I think that's the solution."},{"question":"A chef who specializes in preparing meals for large church gatherings knows that the number of attendees at these events affects the amount of food he needs to prepare. The chef has noticed a pattern: when the number of attendees is doubled, the cost of ingredients increases by a quadratic factor.1. If the cost of ingredients for a gathering with ( x ) attendees is given by the polynomial function ( C(x) = 3x^2 + 5x + 2 ), find the cost of ingredients if the number of attendees is doubled.2. For a specific large church event, the budget for ingredients is 800. Set up and solve an inequality to determine the maximum number of attendees ( x ) that the chef can serve without exceeding the budget.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a chef who prepares meals for church gatherings. The cost of ingredients depends on the number of attendees, and when the number of attendees doubles, the cost increases quadratically. Hmm, quadratic increase means it's related to squaring the number, right?The first part of the problem says that the cost function is given by C(x) = 3x² + 5x + 2. They want to know the cost when the number of attendees is doubled. So, if the original number is x, doubling it would be 2x. So, I think I just need to substitute 2x into the function C(x).Let me write that out. So, C(2x) would be 3*(2x)² + 5*(2x) + 2. Let me compute each term step by step. First, (2x) squared is 4x², so 3 times that is 3*4x² = 12x². Then, 5 times 2x is 10x. And the constant term is still 2. So putting it all together, C(2x) = 12x² + 10x + 2. That seems straightforward.Wait, let me double-check. If I plug in 2x into each term: the quadratic term is 3*(2x)^2, which is 3*4x² = 12x². The linear term is 5*(2x) = 10x. The constant term remains 2. Yep, that looks correct. So, the cost when the number of attendees is doubled is 12x² + 10x + 2.Moving on to the second part. The budget for ingredients is 800, and we need to find the maximum number of attendees x without exceeding the budget. So, we need to set up an inequality where C(x) ≤ 800.Given that C(x) = 3x² + 5x + 2, the inequality is 3x² + 5x + 2 ≤ 800. To solve for x, I should first bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic inequality. So, subtract 800 from both sides: 3x² + 5x + 2 - 800 ≤ 0, which simplifies to 3x² + 5x - 798 ≤ 0.Now, I need to solve 3x² + 5x - 798 ≤ 0. To find the critical points where the expression equals zero, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 3, b = 5, c = -798.Calculating the discriminant first: b² - 4ac = 5² - 4*3*(-798) = 25 + 4*3*798. Let me compute 4*3 first, which is 12. Then, 12*798. Hmm, 12*700 is 8400, and 12*98 is 1176. So, 8400 + 1176 = 9576. Therefore, the discriminant is 25 + 9576 = 9601.Wait, 9601 is a perfect square, right? Let me check: 98 squared is 9604, which is a bit more. So, 98² = 9604, so 97² is 9409. Hmm, 9601 is between them. Wait, maybe 98 squared is 9604, so 98² - 3 is 9601. Hmm, but is 9601 a perfect square? Let me see, 98*98 is 9604, so 97*97 is 9409, 96*96 is 9216, 95*95 is 9025, 94*94 is 8836, 93*93 is 8649, 92*92 is 8464, 91*91 is 8281, 90*90 is 8100. Wait, none of these are 9601. Maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.Wait, let's recalculate the discriminant step by step. b² is 5² = 25. Then, 4ac is 4*3*(-798) = 12*(-798) = -9576. So, discriminant is 25 - (-9576) = 25 + 9576 = 9601. So, yes, discriminant is 9601. Hmm, is 9601 a perfect square? Let me check 98² is 9604, so 98² is 9604, so 98² - 3 is 9601. So, 9601 is not a perfect square. Wait, but 98² is 9604, so 9601 is 98² - 3, which is not a perfect square. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.Wait, no, 9601 divided by 7 is 1371.571... Not an integer. Divided by 13 is 738.538... Not an integer. Maybe it's a prime? Wait, no, 9601 is 98² - 3, but perhaps it's a square of a number close to 98. Let me try 98 - 1 = 97: 97² is 9409, which is too low. 98² is 9604, so 9601 is 9604 - 3, which is not a square. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.Wait, let's check the discriminant again. The quadratic is 3x² + 5x - 798. So, a=3, b=5, c=-798. So discriminant is b² - 4ac = 25 - 4*3*(-798) = 25 + 12*798. 12*798: 10*798=7980, 2*798=1596, so 7980+1596=9576. So, discriminant is 25 + 9576 = 9601. So, yes, discriminant is 9601. Hmm, maybe it's a perfect square after all. Let me see: 98² is 9604, so 98² - 3 = 9601. So, 9601 is not a perfect square. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant.Wait, no, 9601 is actually 98² - 3, which is not a perfect square. So, maybe I need to compute the square root of 9601. Let me try to compute sqrt(9601). Let's see, 98² is 9604, so sqrt(9601) is 98 - a little bit. Let me compute 98*98=9604, so 98²=9604, so 9601 is 9604 - 3, so sqrt(9601)=98 - 3/(2*98) approximately, using linear approximation. But maybe it's better to just compute it numerically.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me check: 3x² +5x +2 ≤800. So, 3x² +5x -798 ≤0. So, discriminant is 5² -4*3*(-798)=25 + 12*798. 12*798: 10*798=7980, 2*798=1596, total 7980+1596=9576. So, discriminant is 25+9576=9601. So, sqrt(9601)=98.00... Wait, no, 98²=9604, so sqrt(9601)=98 - 3/(2*98) approximately, but actually, 98²=9604, so 9601 is 98² -3, which is not a perfect square. So, maybe I need to compute sqrt(9601) numerically.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check: C(x)=3x² +5x +2 ≤800. So, 3x² +5x +2 -800 ≤0 → 3x² +5x -798 ≤0. That seems correct. So, discriminant is 5² -4*3*(-798)=25 + 12*798=25 +9576=9601. Hmm, 9601 is 98² -3, so sqrt(9601)=98 - something. Alternatively, maybe I can factor 9601. Let me try dividing 9601 by small primes. 9601 ÷7=1371.571... Not integer. 9601 ÷13=738.538... Not integer. 9601 ÷17=564.764... Not integer. 9601 ÷19=505.315... Not integer. 9601 ÷23=417.434... Not integer. 9601 ÷29=331.069... Not integer. 9601 ÷31=309.71... Not integer. 9601 ÷37=259.486... Not integer. Hmm, maybe it's a prime number? Or perhaps I made a mistake earlier.Wait, maybe I can compute sqrt(9601) by hand. Let's see, 98²=9604, so sqrt(9601)=98 - ε, where ε is small. Let's compute (98 - ε)²=9601. So, 98² - 2*98*ε + ε²=9601. We know 98²=9604, so 9604 - 196ε + ε²=9601. So, 9604 -9601=196ε - ε². So, 3=196ε - ε². Since ε is small, ε² is negligible, so 196ε≈3 → ε≈3/196≈0.0153. So, sqrt(9601)≈98 -0.0153≈97.9847. So, approximately 97.9847.So, the roots are x = [-5 ±97.9847]/(2*3). Let's compute both roots.First, the positive root: (-5 +97.9847)/6 ≈ (92.9847)/6 ≈15.49745.The negative root: (-5 -97.9847)/6≈(-102.9847)/6≈-17.1641.Since the number of attendees can't be negative, we only consider the positive root, which is approximately15.49745. So, the quadratic expression 3x² +5x -798 is less than or equal to zero between the two roots, from -17.1641 to15.49745. Since x can't be negative, the maximum number of attendees is approximately15.49745. Since the number of attendees must be an integer, we take the floor of that, which is15.Wait, but let me check if x=15 satisfies the inequality. Let's compute C(15)=3*(15)^2 +5*15 +2=3*225 +75 +2=675 +75 +2=752. 752 is less than 800, so that's good. What about x=16? C(16)=3*256 +5*16 +2=768 +80 +2=850. 850 is greater than 800, so x=16 exceeds the budget. Therefore, the maximum number of attendees is15.Wait, but earlier I got approximately15.497, so 15 is the maximum integer less than that. So, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can solve the quadratic inequality exactly. Let me see, since the discriminant is 9601, which is 98² -3, but it's not a perfect square, so we have to leave it in terms of square roots. So, the roots are x = [-5 ±sqrt(9601)]/(6). Since sqrt(9601)=98 - something, as we saw earlier, but it's not a whole number. So, the exact roots are (-5 + sqrt(9601))/6 and (-5 - sqrt(9601))/6. Since sqrt(9601)≈97.9847, the positive root is≈( -5 +97.9847)/6≈92.9847/6≈15.49745, as before.So, the solution to the inequality 3x² +5x -798 ≤0 is x ≤ [ -5 + sqrt(9601) ] /6 ≈15.49745. Since x must be an integer, the maximum number is15.Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for C(15) and C(16). C(15)=3*(15)^2 +5*15 +2=3*225=675, 5*15=75, so 675+75=750, plus 2 is752. Correct. C(16)=3*256=768, 5*16=80, so 768+80=848, plus 2 is850. Correct. So, 16 exceeds 800, so 15 is the maximum.Wait, but the problem says \\"set up and solve an inequality to determine the maximum number of attendees x that the chef can serve without exceeding the budget.\\" So, I think I did that correctly.So, to recap:1. When the number of attendees is doubled, the cost becomes C(2x)=12x² +10x +2.2. The maximum number of attendees without exceeding 800 is15.I think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.For part 1, substituting 2x into C(x)=3x² +5x +2 gives 3*(2x)^2 +5*(2x) +2=12x² +10x +2. That seems correct.For part 2, setting up 3x² +5x +2 ≤800, subtracting 800 gives 3x² +5x -798 ≤0. Using quadratic formula, discriminant is25 +12*798=25 +9576=9601. Square root of9601 is approximately97.9847, so positive root is (-5 +97.9847)/6≈15.497, so maximum integer x is15. Checked C(15)=752≤800 and C(16)=850>800. So, correct.Yeah, I think that's solid."},{"question":"As a tech-savvy parent who manages the soccer team's statistics, you want to create a data visualization that predicts the number of goals scored by different players in upcoming matches. The number of goals scored by a player, ( G(x) ), can be modeled by the quadratic equation:[ G(x) = -2x^2 + 10x + 3 ]where ( x ) represents the number of matches played.1. Determine the number of matches ( x ) after which the player will achieve the maximum number of goals. What is the maximum number of goals the player can score?2. If the team needs to reach at least 20 goals to win the championship, in which range of matches ( x ) does the player score at least 20 goals? Solve the inequality for ( G(x) geq 20 ).","answer":"First, I recognize that the number of goals scored by the player is modeled by the quadratic equation ( G(x) = -2x^2 + 10x + 3 ). Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is negative, the parabola opens downward, indicating that the function has a maximum point.To find the maximum number of goals and the corresponding number of matches, I'll use the vertex formula for a quadratic function. The x-coordinate of the vertex, which gives the number of matches ( x ) at the maximum, is calculated as ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ). Here, ( a = -2 ) and ( b = 10 ), so ( x = -frac{10}{2 times -2} = 2.5 ). This means the maximum number of goals occurs after 2.5 matches.Next, I'll substitute ( x = 2.5 ) back into the equation to find the maximum number of goals:[G(2.5) = -2(2.5)^2 + 10(2.5) + 3 = -12.5 + 25 + 3 = 15.5]So, the player can score a maximum of 15.5 goals.For the second part, I need to determine the range of matches ( x ) where the player scores at least 20 goals.

Given that the parabola opens downward, the expression ( -2x^2 + 10x - 17 ) is always negative. Therefore, there is no range of ( x ) where ( G(x) geq 20 )."},{"question":"The station manager is evaluating the performance of a fare collector who handles tickets for two different types of commuters: regular commuters and discounted pass holders.

I need to determine the number of regular commuter tickets and discounted pass holder tickets sold on the first day.Let’s define the variables:- Let ( x ) be the number of discounted pass holder tickets sold.- Since the number of regular commuter tickets sold is twice that of discounted pass holder tickets, I'll denote the number of regular commuter tickets as ( 2x ).Each discounted pass holder ticket costs 3, so the total revenue from discounted tickets is ( 3x ).Each regular commuter ticket costs 6, so the total revenue from regular tickets is ( 6 times 2x = 12x ).The total revenue collected is 450, so I can set up the equation:[3x + 12x = 450]Combining like terms:[15x = 450]Solving for ( x ):[x = frac{450}{15} = 30]Therefore, the number of discounted pass holder tickets sold is 30, and the number of regular commuter tickets sold is ( 2 times 30 = 60 ).Next, for the second part of the problem, I need to find the number of each type of ticket sold on the second day.Let’s define the variables for the second day:- Let ( y ) be the number of regular commuter tickets sold.- Since the number of discounted pass holder tickets sold is three times that of regular commuter tickets, I'll denote the number of discounted pass holder tickets as ( 3y ).Each regular commuter ticket costs 6, so the total revenue from regular tickets is ( 6y ).Each discounted pass holder ticket costs 3, so the total revenue from discounted tickets is ( 3 times 3y = 9y ).The total revenue collected on the second day is 540, so I can set up the equation:[6y + 9y = 540]Combining like terms:[15y = 540]Solving for ( y ):[y = frac{540}{15} = 36]Therefore, the number of regular commuter tickets sold is 36, and the number of discounted pass holder tickets sold is ( 3 times 36 = 108 )."},{"question":"A team of sound engineers and mixers is working to optimize the acoustics in a recording studio for a singer-songwriter.

After some analysis, it is determined that productivity per member decreases quadratically as ( P(x) = -2x^2 + 8x + 10 ). 2. Determine the number of team members, ( x ), that maximizes productivity.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where an entrepreneur is hiring a recruitment consultant. The consultant charges a fixed fee plus a variable fee per team member. The fixed fee is 500, and the variable fee is 200 per person. The entrepreneur has a budget of 2,500 for recruitment fees. First, I need to write an inequality representing the maximum number of team members, x, that can be recruited without exceeding the budget. Then, I have to solve that inequality. Alright, let's break this down. The total cost is the fixed fee plus the variable fee. The fixed fee is a flat 500, and the variable fee is 200 multiplied by the number of team members, which is x. So, the total cost would be 500 + 200x. The entrepreneur doesn't want this total cost to exceed 2,500. So, the inequality should be:500 + 200x ≤ 2500Now, I need to solve for x. Let me subtract 500 from both sides to isolate the term with x.200x ≤ 2500 - 500200x ≤ 2000Now, divide both sides by 200 to solve for x.x ≤ 2000 / 200x ≤ 10So, the maximum number of team members that can be recruited without exceeding the budget is 10. That seems straightforward.Moving on to the second part. The entrepreneur is concerned that having too few team members will increase the workload and decrease productivity. There's a productivity function given: P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 10. I need to determine the number of team members, x, that maximizes productivity.Hmm, okay. So, this is a quadratic function, and since the coefficient of x² is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola is the maximum point. So, the vertex will give me the x-value that maximizes productivity.The general form of a quadratic function is ax² + bx + c. In this case, a = -2, b = 8, and c = 10.The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by the formula -b/(2a). Let me plug in the values.x = -8 / (2 * -2)x = -8 / (-4)x = 2Wait, so x is 2? That seems low. If x is 2, that would mean only 2 team members would maximize productivity? But earlier, we found that the maximum number of team members is 10. So, does that mean that productivity is maximized at 2 team members, but the entrepreneur can actually hire up to 10? Let me double-check my calculation. The formula is -b/(2a). Here, b is 8, a is -2.So, x = -8 / (2 * -2) = -8 / (-4) = 2. Yeah, that's correct. So, according to this, productivity is maximized when there are 2 team members.But wait, that seems counterintuitive. If you have only 2 team members, isn't the workload really high? But according to the function, P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 10, the productivity peaks at x = 2. Let me test this function with some values to see.If x = 0, P(0) = -2(0) + 8(0) + 10 = 10.x = 1: P(1) = -2(1) + 8(1) + 10 = -2 + 8 + 10 = 16.x = 2: P(2) = -2(4) + 8(2) + 10 = -8 + 16 + 10 = 18.x = 3: P(3) = -2(9) + 8(3) + 10 = -18 + 24 + 10 = 16.x = 4: P(4) = -2(16) + 8(4) + 10 = -32 + 32 + 10 = 10.x = 5: P(5) = -2(25) + 8(5) + 10 = -50 + 40 + 10 = 0.Wait, so at x = 5, productivity is zero? That's interesting. So, beyond x = 5, productivity becomes negative? That might not make sense in a real-world context, but mathematically, that's how the function behaves.So, according to the function, productivity increases from x = 0 to x = 2, reaching a maximum at x = 2, then decreases, and becomes zero at x = 5, and negative beyond that.But in the context of the problem, the entrepreneur can hire up to 10 team members. So, if productivity is maximized at 2, but the budget allows for 10, does that mean that the entrepreneur should only hire 2 team members? Or is there a different interpretation?Wait, maybe I misread the problem. It says that productivity per member decreases quadratically as P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 10. So, is P(x) the productivity per member or total productivity?Looking back: \\"productivity per member decreases quadratically as P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 10.\\" So, P(x) is productivity per member. So, each team member's productivity is given by that function.So, if each member's productivity is P(x), then total productivity would be x * P(x). But the question is asking for the number of team members that maximizes productivity. It's a bit ambiguous whether it's per member or total.Wait, let me check the exact wording: \\"Determine the number of team members, x, that maximizes productivity.\\" It doesn't specify per member or total. Hmm.But given that P(x) is defined as productivity per member, and the function is given as P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 10, I think it's referring to per member productivity. So, if each member's productivity is given by that function, then the total productivity would be x * P(x).But the question is just asking for the number of team members that maximizes productivity. So, if it's per member, then it's maximized at x = 2. If it's total productivity, then we need to compute x * P(x) and find its maximum.Wait, let's clarify. The problem says: \\"productivity per member decreases quadratically as P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 10.\\" So, P(x) is per member productivity. So, if we want to maximize per member productivity, it's maximized at x = 2.But if we want to maximize total productivity, which would be x * P(x), then we need to find the x that maximizes that function.So, the question is a bit ambiguous, but since it says \\"productivity per member,\\" I think it's referring to per member productivity. So, the number of team members that maximizes per member productivity is 2.But let me think again. If the entrepreneur is concerned about productivity, they might be more interested in total productivity rather than per member. Because if you have more team members, even if each is less productive, the total might be higher.But the problem says \\"productivity per member decreases quadratically,\\" so they're specifically talking about per member productivity. So, perhaps the question is about per member productivity.But just to be thorough, let me compute both.First, if we consider per member productivity, P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 10. As we saw, it's a quadratic function with maximum at x = 2.If we consider total productivity, which would be x * P(x) = x*(-2x² + 8x + 10) = -2x³ + 8x² + 10x.To find the maximum of this cubic function, we can take its derivative and set it to zero.So, let me compute the derivative:d/dx (-2x³ + 8x² + 10x) = -6x² + 16x + 10.Set this equal to zero:-6x² + 16x + 10 = 0Multiply both sides by -1:6x² - 16x - 10 = 0Now, use quadratic formula:x = [16 ± sqrt(256 + 240)] / 12Because discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-16)^2 - 4*6*(-10) = 256 + 240 = 496So, sqrt(496) = sqrt(16*31) = 4*sqrt(31) ≈ 4*5.567 ≈ 22.268So, x = [16 ± 22.268]/12We can ignore the negative solution because x can't be negative.So, x = (16 + 22.268)/12 ≈ 38.268/12 ≈ 3.189So, approximately 3.189. Since x must be an integer, we can check x=3 and x=4.Compute total productivity at x=3:Total P = 3*(-2*9 + 8*3 +10) = 3*(-18 +24 +10)=3*(16)=48At x=4:Total P =4*(-2*16 +8*4 +10)=4*(-32 +32 +10)=4*(10)=40So, total productivity is higher at x=3 than at x=4. So, the maximum total productivity occurs at x=3.But wait, the question is about the number of team members that maximizes productivity. If it's per member, it's 2; if it's total, it's 3.But the problem says: \\"productivity per member decreases quadratically as P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 10.\\" So, it's specifically about per member productivity. So, the question is probably asking for the x that maximizes per member productivity, which is 2.But just to make sure, let me read the question again: \\"Determine the number of team members, x, that maximizes productivity.\\"It doesn't specify per member or total. Hmm. That's a bit ambiguous. But since the function given is per member productivity, it's more likely that they're asking for the x that maximizes per member productivity.But just to be safe, maybe I should mention both interpretations.Wait, but in the first part, we found that the maximum number of team members is 10. So, if the entrepreneur can hire up to 10, but per member productivity is maximized at 2, but total productivity is maximized at 3, which is better?If the goal is to have the most productive team, then total productivity is more relevant. So, maybe the question is about total productivity.But the function given is per member. So, perhaps the question is about per member productivity.Wait, let me think about the wording again: \\"productivity per member decreases quadratically as P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 10.\\" So, P(x) is per member productivity. So, the function is per member.So, the question is: \\"Determine the number of team members, x, that maximizes productivity.\\"Since P(x) is per member productivity, it's about per member. So, the number of team members that maximizes per member productivity is x=2.But if the entrepreneur wants to maximize total productivity, then it's x=3.But the problem doesn't specify. It just says \\"maximizes productivity.\\" So, perhaps it's safer to assume that it's per member productivity, as that's what the function represents.Alternatively, maybe the question is about total productivity, but the function given is per member. So, perhaps the question is expecting the answer based on the function given, which is per member.Given that, I think the answer is x=2.But let me think again. If the function is per member productivity, then each additional member beyond 2 would decrease the productivity of each member. So, the entrepreneur might want to balance between having enough team members to get work done without overloading each member.But since the question is about maximizing productivity, and the function is per member, then x=2 is the answer.But just to make sure, let me think about the context. The entrepreneur has a budget for recruitment fees, but also is concerned about productivity. So, they might want to find the optimal number of team members that balances cost and productivity.But the question specifically asks to determine the number of team members that maximizes productivity, given that P(x) is per member. So, I think it's x=2.But wait, when x=2, each member's productivity is 18. If the entrepreneur hires 2 members, total productivity is 36. If they hire 3 members, each member's productivity is 16, so total productivity is 48. If they hire 4 members, each member's productivity is 10, total productivity is 40. So, total productivity is higher at x=3.So, if the goal is to maximize total productivity, x=3 is better. If the goal is to maximize per member productivity, x=2 is better.But the problem says \\"productivity per member decreases quadratically as P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 10.\\" So, it's about per member productivity. So, the number of team members that maximizes per member productivity is x=2.But the question is a bit ambiguous. It says \\"maximizes productivity.\\" Without specifying, it's unclear. But since the function is given as per member, I think it's safer to answer x=2.Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the answer based on the function given, regardless of whether it's per member or total. So, since the function is quadratic, the maximum is at x=2.But let me think again. If P(x) is per member productivity, then the total productivity is x*P(x). So, the function for total productivity is a cubic function, which we found has a maximum at approximately x=3.189, so x=3.But the question is asking for the number of team members that maximizes productivity. If it's total productivity, it's 3. If it's per member, it's 2.Given that the function is given as per member productivity, I think the question is about per member productivity. So, the answer is x=2.But to be thorough, I should probably mention both interpretations, but since the function is per member, I think x=2 is the answer.Wait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \\"productivity per member decreases quadratically as P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 10.\\" So, it's clear that P(x) is per member productivity. So, the function is per member.Therefore, the number of team members that maximizes per member productivity is x=2.But if the entrepreneur wants to maximize total productivity, they should hire 3 members. But since the question is about productivity, and the function is per member, I think the answer is 2.But just to make sure, let me think about the context. The entrepreneur is building a team, so they probably care about total productivity, not just per member. But the function given is per member. So, perhaps the question is about per member.Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the answer based on the function given, regardless of context. So, since P(x) is given, and it's a quadratic function, the maximum is at x=2.I think I'll go with x=2 as the answer for the number of team members that maximizes productivity, assuming it's per member.But just to be safe, maybe I should mention both interpretations in my answer. But since the function is per member, I think x=2 is the answer.So, summarizing:1. The inequality is 500 + 200x ≤ 2500, which simplifies to x ≤ 10. So, maximum 10 team members.2. The number of team members that maximizes productivity is x=2.But wait, let me think again. If the entrepreneur can hire up to 10, but productivity per member is maximized at 2, but total productivity is higher at 3, which is better? Maybe the entrepreneur should hire 3 members to get higher total productivity, even though each member is slightly less productive.But the question is specifically about the number of team members that maximizes productivity, and the function given is per member. So, I think it's 2.Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the answer based on the function given, regardless of context. So, since P(x) is given, and it's a quadratic function, the maximum is at x=2.I think that's the answer they're looking for.**Final Answer**1. The maximum number of team members is boxed{10}.2. The number of team members that maximizes productivity is boxed{2}."},{"question":"A large technology corporation, TechCorp, is involved in a patent dispute with a competitor. The dispute centers around a patented technology that improves data processing speeds. The annual revenue generated by this technology can be described by the polynomial function ( R(x) = 4x^3 - 15x^2 + 9x + 200 ), where ( x ) represents the number of years since the technology was patented.1. TechCorp wants to determine the number of years it will take for the annual revenue from the technology to reach 300 million. Solve the equation ( R(x) = 300 ) for ( x ).2. To ensure profitability, TechCorp needs the annual revenue to always be greater than the annual legal costs associated with the patent disputes, which are modeled by the quadratic function ( C(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 100 ). Determine the range of years ( x ) for which the revenue ( R(x) ) exceeds the cost ( C(x) ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about TechCorp and their patent dispute. They've given me two functions: one for revenue and one for costs. I need to solve two things here. First, figure out when the revenue hits 300 million, and second, determine the years where revenue is greater than the legal costs. Let me take this step by step.Starting with the first part: solving R(x) = 300. The revenue function is given as R(x) = 4x³ - 15x² + 9x + 200. So, I need to set this equal to 300 and solve for x. That means I'll have the equation:4x³ - 15x² + 9x + 200 = 300Hmm, okay. Let me subtract 300 from both sides to set the equation to zero:4x³ - 15x² + 9x + 200 - 300 = 0Simplifying that, 200 - 300 is -100, so:4x³ - 15x² + 9x - 100 = 0Now, I have a cubic equation: 4x³ - 15x² + 9x - 100 = 0. Solving cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor this or use the rational root theorem to find possible roots.The rational root theorem says that any possible rational root, p/q, is a factor of the constant term over a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -100, and the leading coefficient is 4. So, possible roots could be ±1, ±2, ±4, ±5, ±10, ±20, ±25, ±50, ±100, and then divided by 1, 2, or 4.Let me test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation.First, let's try x = 1:4(1)³ - 15(1)² + 9(1) - 100 = 4 - 15 + 9 - 100 = (4 - 15) + (9 - 100) = (-11) + (-91) = -102 ≠ 0Not a root. How about x = 2:4(8) - 15(4) + 9(2) - 100 = 32 - 60 + 18 - 100 = (32 - 60) + (18 - 100) = (-28) + (-82) = -110 ≠ 0Still not a root. Let's try x = 4:4(64) - 15(16) + 9(4) - 100 = 256 - 240 + 36 - 100 = (256 - 240) + (36 - 100) = 16 + (-64) = -48 ≠ 0Not a root either. Maybe x = 5:4(125) - 15(25) + 9(5) - 100 = 500 - 375 + 45 - 100 = (500 - 375) + (45 - 100) = 125 - 55 = 70 ≠ 0Still not zero. Hmm, maybe x = 10:4(1000) - 15(100) + 9(10) - 100 = 4000 - 1500 + 90 - 100 = (4000 - 1500) + (90 - 100) = 2500 - 10 = 2490 ≠ 0Way too big. Maybe I should try a negative value? Let's see x = -1:4(-1)³ - 15(-1)² + 9(-1) - 100 = -4 - 15 - 9 - 100 = -128 ≠ 0Nope. How about x = 5/2, which is 2.5? Let me compute that:4*(2.5)^3 - 15*(2.5)^2 + 9*(2.5) - 100First, 2.5³ is 15.625, so 4*15.625 = 62.52.5² is 6.25, so 15*6.25 = 93.759*2.5 = 22.5So putting it all together: 62.5 - 93.75 + 22.5 - 10062.5 - 93.75 = -31.25-31.25 + 22.5 = -8.75-8.75 - 100 = -108.75 ≠ 0Not a root either. Hmm, maybe x = 5/4, which is 1.25:4*(1.25)^3 - 15*(1.25)^2 + 9*(1.25) - 1001.25³ = 1.953125, so 4*1.953125 = 7.81251.25² = 1.5625, so 15*1.5625 = 23.43759*1.25 = 11.25So, 7.8125 - 23.4375 + 11.25 - 1007.8125 - 23.4375 = -15.625-15.625 + 11.25 = -4.375-4.375 - 100 = -104.375 ≠ 0Still not zero. Maybe x = 10/4 = 2.5, which I already tried. Hmm, maybe x = 20/4 = 5, which I tried earlier. Not helpful.Wait, maybe x = 2.5 is a root? But I just calculated it and it wasn't. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check:x = 2.5:4*(2.5)^3 = 4*(15.625) = 62.5-15*(2.5)^2 = -15*(6.25) = -93.759*(2.5) = 22.5-100So total: 62.5 - 93.75 + 22.5 - 100 = (62.5 - 93.75) = -31.25; (-31.25 + 22.5) = -8.75; (-8.75 - 100) = -108.75. Yeah, that's correct.Hmm, maybe I need to try another approach. Maybe synthetic division or factoring.Alternatively, perhaps graphing the function would help. Since it's a cubic, it will cross the x-axis at least once. Let me think about the behavior of the function.As x approaches positive infinity, 4x³ dominates, so the function goes to positive infinity. As x approaches negative infinity, it goes to negative infinity. So, there must be at least one real root.Wait, but in the context of the problem, x represents years, so x must be a positive real number. So, I'm only interested in positive roots.Given that, let's try to see if there's a root between 3 and 4.Compute R(3):4*(27) - 15*(9) + 9*(3) - 100 = 108 - 135 + 27 - 100 = (108 - 135) + (27 - 100) = (-27) + (-73) = -100R(3) = -100R(4):4*(64) - 15*(16) + 9*(4) - 100 = 256 - 240 + 36 - 100 = (256 - 240) + (36 - 100) = 16 - 64 = -48Still negative.R(5):4*125 - 15*25 + 9*5 - 100 = 500 - 375 + 45 - 100 = 70So, R(5) is 70.Wait, so R(4) is -48 and R(5) is 70. So, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a root between 4 and 5.Similarly, R(3) is -100, R(4) is -48, so it's still negative. So, the root is between 4 and 5.Let me try x = 4.5:4*(4.5)^3 - 15*(4.5)^2 + 9*(4.5) - 100First, 4.5³ = 91.125, so 4*91.125 = 364.54.5² = 20.25, so 15*20.25 = 303.759*4.5 = 40.5So, 364.5 - 303.75 + 40.5 - 100364.5 - 303.75 = 60.7560.75 + 40.5 = 101.25101.25 - 100 = 1.25So, R(4.5) ≈ 1.25. Close to zero. So, the root is between 4 and 4.5.Wait, R(4) = -48, R(4.5) ≈ 1.25. So, let's try x = 4.25:4*(4.25)^3 - 15*(4.25)^2 + 9*(4.25) - 100First, 4.25³: 4.25*4.25 = 18.0625; 18.0625*4.25 ≈ 76.765625So, 4*76.765625 ≈ 307.06254.25² = 18.0625, so 15*18.0625 ≈ 270.93759*4.25 = 38.25So, 307.0625 - 270.9375 + 38.25 - 100307.0625 - 270.9375 = 36.12536.125 + 38.25 = 74.37574.375 - 100 = -25.625So, R(4.25) ≈ -25.625So, R(4.25) is negative, R(4.5) is positive. So, the root is between 4.25 and 4.5.Let me try x = 4.375:4*(4.375)^3 - 15*(4.375)^2 + 9*(4.375) - 100First, 4.375³: 4.375*4.375 = 19.140625; 19.140625*4.375 ≈ 83.671875So, 4*83.671875 ≈ 334.68754.375² = 19.140625, so 15*19.140625 ≈ 287.1093759*4.375 = 39.375So, 334.6875 - 287.109375 + 39.375 - 100334.6875 - 287.109375 ≈ 47.57812547.578125 + 39.375 ≈ 86.95312586.953125 - 100 ≈ -13.046875Still negative. So, R(4.375) ≈ -13.05Next, x = 4.4375:4*(4.4375)^3 - 15*(4.4375)^2 + 9*(4.4375) - 100First, 4.4375³: 4.4375*4.4375 ≈ 19.69140625; 19.69140625*4.4375 ≈ 87.390625So, 4*87.390625 ≈ 349.56254.4375² ≈ 19.69140625, so 15*19.69140625 ≈ 295.371093759*4.4375 ≈ 39.9375So, 349.5625 - 295.37109375 + 39.9375 - 100349.5625 - 295.37109375 ≈ 54.1914062554.19140625 + 39.9375 ≈ 94.1289062594.12890625 - 100 ≈ -5.87109375Still negative, but closer to zero.x = 4.46875:4*(4.46875)^3 - 15*(4.46875)^2 + 9*(4.46875) - 100First, 4.46875³: 4.46875*4.46875 ≈ 19.970703125; 19.970703125*4.46875 ≈ 89.265625So, 4*89.265625 ≈ 357.06254.46875² ≈ 19.970703125, so 15*19.970703125 ≈ 299.5605468759*4.46875 ≈ 40.21875So, 357.0625 - 299.560546875 + 40.21875 - 100357.0625 - 299.560546875 ≈ 57.50195312557.501953125 + 40.21875 ≈ 97.72070312597.720703125 - 100 ≈ -2.279296875Still negative, but getting closer.x = 4.484375:4*(4.484375)^3 - 15*(4.484375)^2 + 9*(4.484375) - 100First, 4.484375³: 4.484375*4.484375 ≈ 20.1142578125; 20.1142578125*4.484375 ≈ 90.0So, 4*90 ≈ 3604.484375² ≈ 20.1142578125, so 15*20.1142578125 ≈ 301.71386718759*4.484375 ≈ 40.359375So, 360 - 301.7138671875 + 40.359375 - 100360 - 301.7138671875 ≈ 58.286132812558.2861328125 + 40.359375 ≈ 98.645507812598.6455078125 - 100 ≈ -1.3544921875Still negative, but closer.x = 4.4921875:4*(4.4921875)^3 - 15*(4.4921875)^2 + 9*(4.4921875) - 100First, 4.4921875³: Let's approximate:4.4921875*4.4921875 ≈ 20.180664062520.1806640625*4.4921875 ≈ 90.5So, 4*90.5 ≈ 3624.4921875² ≈ 20.1806640625, so 15*20.1806640625 ≈ 302.70996093759*4.4921875 ≈ 40.4296875So, 362 - 302.7099609375 + 40.4296875 - 100362 - 302.7099609375 ≈ 59.290039062559.2900390625 + 40.4296875 ≈ 99.719726562599.7197265625 - 100 ≈ -0.2802734375Almost zero, but still negative.x = 4.49609375:4*(4.49609375)^3 - 15*(4.49609375)^2 + 9*(4.49609375) - 100Approximating:4.49609375³ ≈ (4.496)^3 ≈ 4.496*4.496 ≈ 20.216, then 20.216*4.496 ≈ 90.7So, 4*90.7 ≈ 362.84.49609375² ≈ 20.216, so 15*20.216 ≈ 303.249*4.49609375 ≈ 40.46484375So, 362.8 - 303.24 + 40.46484375 - 100362.8 - 303.24 ≈ 59.5659.56 + 40.46484375 ≈ 100.02484375100.02484375 - 100 ≈ 0.02484375So, R(4.49609375) ≈ 0.0248. Almost zero, slightly positive.So, the root is between 4.4921875 and 4.49609375.To approximate, let's do linear approximation between these two points.At x = 4.4921875, R(x) ≈ -0.2802734375At x = 4.49609375, R(x) ≈ 0.02484375The difference in x is 4.49609375 - 4.4921875 = 0.00390625The difference in R(x) is 0.02484375 - (-0.2802734375) = 0.3051171875We need to find the x where R(x) = 0. So, starting from x = 4.4921875, which is -0.2802734375, we need to cover 0.2802734375 to reach zero.The fraction is 0.2802734375 / 0.3051171875 ≈ 0.918So, the root is approximately at x = 4.4921875 + 0.918*0.00390625 ≈ 4.4921875 + 0.003583984 ≈ 4.495771484So, approximately 4.4958 years.Since the problem is about years, and it's a bit over 4.5 years, so about 4.5 years. But let me check if the question expects an exact value or an approximate.Wait, the original equation is 4x³ - 15x² + 9x - 100 = 0. Maybe I can factor this.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming it's a cubic. Let me check the original R(x) = 4x³ -15x² +9x +200. So, R(x) = 300 is 4x³ -15x² +9x -100 = 0.Wait, maybe I can factor this cubic. Let me try grouping.4x³ -15x² +9x -100Group as (4x³ -15x²) + (9x -100)Factor out x² from the first group: x²(4x -15) + (9x -100)Hmm, doesn't seem to help. Alternatively, maybe factor by grouping differently.Alternatively, perhaps use the cubic formula, but that's complicated.Alternatively, maybe use synthetic division with the approximate root we found.But since it's a cubic, and we have one real root, we can factor it as (x - a)(quadratic). But since a is approximately 4.4958, which is not a nice number, it's probably not factorable with integer roots.Therefore, the solution is approximately x ≈ 4.496 years. So, about 4.5 years.But since the question is about the number of years, and it's a bit over 4.5, maybe we can say approximately 4.5 years. But let me see if the problem expects an exact value or if it's okay with decimal.Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a fraction. 4.496 is roughly 4 and 496/1000, which simplifies to 4 and 124/250, which is 4 and 62/125, or 4.496.But maybe the problem expects an exact value, but since it's a cubic, it's unlikely to have a nice exact solution. So, probably, the answer is approximately 4.5 years.Wait, but let me check if x = 5 is 70, which is above 300? Wait, no, R(x) is 4x³ -15x² +9x +200. So, R(5) = 4*125 -15*25 +45 +200 = 500 - 375 +45 +200 = 500 - 375 is 125, 125 +45 is 170, 170 +200 is 370. So, R(5) is 370, which is above 300. So, the revenue reaches 300 between 4 and 5 years, specifically around 4.5 years.But the question is to solve R(x) = 300, so x ≈ 4.5 years. But since it's a bit over 4.5, maybe 4.5 years is acceptable, or perhaps they want it in fractional form.Alternatively, maybe I can write it as 4.5 years, but to be precise, it's approximately 4.5 years.Wait, but in the context of the problem, x is the number of years since the technology was patented. So, it's a continuous variable, so decimal years are acceptable.So, for part 1, the answer is approximately 4.5 years.Now, moving on to part 2: Determine the range of years x for which the revenue R(x) exceeds the cost C(x). So, R(x) > C(x).Given R(x) = 4x³ -15x² +9x +200C(x) = 2x² -5x +100So, set up the inequality:4x³ -15x² +9x +200 > 2x² -5x +100Subtract 2x² -5x +100 from both sides:4x³ -15x² +9x +200 -2x² +5x -100 > 0Simplify:4x³ -17x² +14x +100 > 0So, the inequality is 4x³ -17x² +14x +100 > 0We need to find the values of x where this cubic is positive.First, let's analyze the cubic function f(x) = 4x³ -17x² +14x +100.To find where f(x) > 0, we need to find its roots and test intervals.First, let's try to find the roots of f(x) = 0.Again, using the rational root theorem, possible roots are factors of 100 over factors of 4: ±1, ±2, ±4, ±5, ±10, ±20, ±25, ±50, ±100, and divided by 1,2,4.Let's test x = 1:4 -17 +14 +100 = 81 ≠ 0x = 2:32 - 68 +28 +100 = 92 ≠ 0x = 4:256 - 272 +56 +100 = 130 ≠ 0x = 5:500 - 425 +70 +100 = 245 ≠ 0x = -1:-4 -17 -14 +100 = 65 ≠ 0x = 10:4000 - 1700 +140 +100 = 2540 ≠ 0x = 2.5:4*(15.625) -17*(6.25) +14*(2.5) +10062.5 - 106.25 +35 +100 = (62.5 -106.25) + (35 +100) = (-43.75) + 135 = 91.25 ≠ 0x = 5/2 = 2.5, tried that.x = 5/4 = 1.25:4*(1.953125) -17*(1.5625) +14*(1.25) +1007.8125 -26.5625 +17.5 +100 = (7.8125 -26.5625) + (17.5 +100) = (-18.75) + 117.5 = 98.75 ≠ 0x = 10/4 = 2.5, tried that.x = 20/4 = 5, tried that.x = 25/4 = 6.25:4*(244.140625) -17*(39.0625) +14*(6.25) +100976.5625 -664.0625 +87.5 +100 = (976.5625 -664.0625) + (87.5 +100) = 312.5 + 187.5 = 500 ≠ 0Hmm, not helpful.Maybe x = 3:4*27 -17*9 +14*3 +100 = 108 -153 +42 +100 = (108 -153) + (42 +100) = (-45) + 142 = 97 ≠ 0x = 3.5:4*(42.875) -17*(12.25) +14*(3.5) +100171.5 -208.25 +49 +100 = (171.5 -208.25) + (49 +100) = (-36.75) + 149 = 112.25 ≠ 0x = 4:4*64 -17*16 +14*4 +100 = 256 -272 +56 +100 = (256 -272) + (56 +100) = (-16) + 156 = 140 ≠ 0x = 4.5:4*(91.125) -17*(20.25) +14*(4.5) +100364.5 -344.25 +63 +100 = (364.5 -344.25) + (63 +100) = 20.25 + 163 = 183.25 ≠ 0Hmm, seems like none of these are roots. Maybe I need to use the rational root theorem differently or try factoring.Alternatively, perhaps use calculus to find critical points and analyze the function.First, find the derivative f'(x) = 12x² -34x +14Set f'(x) = 0:12x² -34x +14 = 0Use quadratic formula:x = [34 ± sqrt(34² - 4*12*14)] / (2*12)Calculate discriminant:34² = 11564*12*14 = 672So, sqrt(1156 - 672) = sqrt(484) = 22Thus, x = [34 ±22]/24So, x = (34 +22)/24 = 56/24 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333x = (34 -22)/24 = 12/24 = 0.5So, critical points at x = 0.5 and x ≈ 2.333Now, let's analyze the behavior of f(x):As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity (since leading term is 4x³).As x approaches positive infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity.We have critical points at x = 0.5 and x ≈ 2.333.Let's compute f(x) at these points to find local maxima and minima.First, f(0.5):4*(0.125) -17*(0.25) +14*(0.5) +100 = 0.5 -4.25 +7 +100 = (0.5 -4.25) + (7 +100) = (-3.75) + 107 = 103.25f(0.5) = 103.25Next, f(2.333):Let me compute f(7/3):4*(343/27) -17*(49/9) +14*(7/3) +100Compute each term:4*(343/27) = 1372/27 ≈ 50.8148-17*(49/9) = -833/9 ≈ -92.555614*(7/3) = 98/3 ≈ 32.6667+100So, total ≈ 50.8148 -92.5556 +32.6667 +100 ≈ (50.8148 -92.5556) + (32.6667 +100) ≈ (-41.7408) + 132.6667 ≈ 90.9259So, f(7/3) ≈ 90.9259Now, let's check f(x) at some other points:f(0) = 0 -0 +0 +100 = 100f(1) = 4 -17 +14 +100 = 91f(2) = 32 -68 +28 +100 = 92f(3) = 108 -153 +42 +100 = 97f(4) = 256 -272 +56 +100 = 140f(5) = 500 -425 +70 +100 = 245So, f(x) is positive at x=0, x=1, x=2, x=3, x=4, x=5, etc.Wait, but earlier when I tried to find roots, I couldn't find any. So, maybe f(x) is always positive?Wait, but let's check f(x) at x = -1:f(-1) = -4 -17 -14 +100 = 65Positive. So, f(x) is positive at x = -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.But wait, if f(x) is a cubic with leading coefficient positive, it goes from negative infinity to positive infinity. So, it must cross the x-axis somewhere. But all the points I checked are positive.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating f(x). Let me check f(0):f(0) = 0 -0 +0 +100 = 100. Correct.f(1) = 4 -17 +14 +100 = 91. Correct.f(2) = 32 -68 +28 +100 = 92. Correct.f(3) = 108 -153 +42 +100 = 97. Correct.f(4) = 256 -272 +56 +100 = 140. Correct.f(5) = 500 -425 +70 +100 = 245. Correct.Wait, so if f(x) is positive at all these points, and as x approaches positive infinity, it's positive, and as x approaches negative infinity, it's negative. So, there must be a root somewhere for x < 0.But in the context of the problem, x represents years since the technology was patented, so x ≥ 0.Therefore, for x ≥ 0, f(x) is always positive because all the tested points are positive, and the function is increasing after x ≈ 2.333.Wait, let me check the derivative again. The critical points are at x = 0.5 and x ≈ 2.333.So, the function decreases from x = -infty to x = 0.5, then increases from x = 0.5 to x ≈ 2.333, then decreases again? Wait, no, the derivative is 12x² -34x +14.Wait, the derivative is a quadratic opening upwards, so it has a minimum between the roots. Wait, no, the derivative is 12x² -34x +14, which is a parabola opening upwards (since coefficient of x² is positive). So, it has a minimum at x = -b/(2a) = 34/(24) ≈ 1.4167.Wait, but we found the critical points at x = 0.5 and x ≈ 2.333.So, the derivative is positive when x < 0.5, negative between 0.5 and 2.333, and positive again after 2.333.Wait, that means f(x) is increasing on (-infty, 0.5), decreasing on (0.5, 2.333), and increasing again on (2.333, infty).So, f(x) has a local maximum at x = 0.5 and a local minimum at x ≈ 2.333.We calculated f(0.5) ≈ 103.25 and f(2.333) ≈ 90.9259.So, the function decreases from x = 0.5 to x ≈ 2.333, reaching a minimum of ~90.9259, then increases again.Since the minimum value at x ≈ 2.333 is still positive (~90.9259), the function f(x) is always positive for x ≥ 0.Therefore, the inequality 4x³ -17x² +14x +100 > 0 holds for all x ≥ 0.But wait, let me check f(x) at x = 0: 100 > 0, correct.At x = 0.5: ~103.25 > 0At x = 2.333: ~90.9259 > 0At x = 5: 245 > 0So, yes, f(x) is always positive for x ≥ 0.Therefore, the revenue R(x) exceeds the cost C(x) for all x ≥ 0.But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Let me check the original functions.R(x) = 4x³ -15x² +9x +200C(x) = 2x² -5x +100So, R(x) - C(x) = 4x³ -17x² +14x +100We found that this is always positive for x ≥ 0.Therefore, the revenue is always greater than the cost for all x ≥ 0.But let me double-check with x = 0:R(0) = 200, C(0) = 100, so 200 > 100, correct.x = 1:R(1) = 4 -15 +9 +200 = 198C(1) = 2 -5 +100 = 97198 > 97, correct.x = 2:R(2) = 32 -60 +18 +200 = 190C(2) = 8 -10 +100 = 98190 > 98, correct.x = 3:R(3) = 108 -135 +27 +200 = 190C(3) = 18 -15 +100 = 103190 > 103, correct.x = 4:R(4) = 256 -240 +36 +200 = 252C(4) = 32 -20 +100 = 112252 > 112, correct.x = 5:R(5) = 500 -375 +45 +200 = 370C(5) = 50 -25 +100 = 125370 > 125, correct.So, yes, it seems that R(x) is always greater than C(x) for all x ≥ 0.Therefore, the range of years x is all non-negative real numbers, x ≥ 0.But since x represents years since the technology was patented, it's x ≥ 0.So, the answer is all x ≥ 0.But let me think again. If f(x) = R(x) - C(x) is always positive for x ≥ 0, then yes, the revenue is always greater than the cost.Therefore, the range is x ≥ 0.But the problem says \\"the range of years x\\", so in interval notation, [0, ∞).But since x is the number of years since the technology was patented, it's x ≥ 0.So, summarizing:1. The revenue reaches 300 million at approximately x ≈ 4.5 years.2. The revenue exceeds the cost for all x ≥ 0.But let me check if there's any point where R(x) could be less than C(x). Since f(x) is always positive, no.Therefore, the answers are:1. Approximately 4.5 years.2. All years x ≥ 0.But let me write the exact answer for part 1, since it's a cubic, maybe it's better to present it as a decimal or a fraction.Earlier, we approximated it to about 4.496, which is roughly 4.5. So, 4.5 years.Alternatively, if we use more precise calculation, it's approximately 4.496, which is about 4.5 years.So, I think it's acceptable to say approximately 4.5 years.Therefore, the final answers are:1. Approximately 4.5 years.2. All years x ≥ 0."},{"question":"A producer, devoted to showcasing the diverse subgenres within metal, is organizing a multi-day metal festival. The festival features three main stages, each dedicated to a different subgenre: Death Metal, Black Metal, and Doom Metal. The producer wants to ensure that each day of the festival has a balanced representation of these subgenres.1. The producer decides that the number of bands playing Death Metal (D), Black Metal (B), and Doom Metal (M) on any given day should satisfy the polynomial equation (D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100), representing the total energy and atmosphere of the festival lineup. Moreover, the producer also wants the total number of bands each day to be at least 15, leading to the inequality (D + B + M geq 15). Find a set of non-negative integer solutions for (D), (B), and (M) that satisfy both conditions.2. The producer also wants to ensure that the number of Doom Metal bands is exactly half the sum of the Death Metal and Black Metal bands. Express this condition as a linear equation and find all integer solutions for the number of Doom Metal bands if the total number of bands each day is exactly 15.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about organizing a metal festival with three stages: Death Metal, Black Metal, and Doom Metal. The producer wants each day to have a balanced lineup, which involves solving some equations and inequalities. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, part 1: The producer has given us a polynomial equation (D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) and an inequality (D + B + M geq 15). We need to find non-negative integer solutions for D, B, and M that satisfy both conditions.Alright, so D, B, M are all non-negative integers. The equation is a sum of squares equal to 100, and the sum of the variables is at least 15. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find triples (D, B, M) such that when each is squared and added, it equals 100, and their sum is at least 15.Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can list all possible combinations where (D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) and then check which of those have (D + B + M geq 15).Since D, B, M are non-negative integers, their squares can't exceed 100. So, each of D, B, M can be at most 10 because (10^2 = 100). So, possible values for each variable are 0 through 10.But listing all possible triples where the sum of squares is 100 might be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable because the numbers aren't too big.Alternatively, maybe I can fix one variable and solve for the other two. Let's try that.Let's fix D first. Let D vary from 0 to 10.For each D, we can compute (D^2), subtract that from 100, and then find pairs (B, M) such that (B^2 + M^2 = 100 - D^2).Also, we need to ensure that (D + B + M geq 15).Let me start with D = 0.Case 1: D = 0Then, (B^2 + M^2 = 100). We need non-negative integers B and M such that their squares add up to 100.Possible pairs (B, M):- (0, 10) since (0 + 100 = 100)- (6, 8) because (36 + 64 = 100)- (8, 6)- (10, 0)So, for D=0, possible (B, M) are (0,10), (6,8), (8,6), (10,0).Now, check the sum (D + B + M):- For (0,10): 0 + 0 + 10 = 10 < 15. Doesn't satisfy.- For (6,8): 0 + 6 + 8 = 14 < 15. Doesn't satisfy.- For (8,6): Same as above, sum is 14.- For (10,0): Sum is 10.So, none of these satisfy the sum being at least 15. So, D=0 doesn't work.Case 2: D=1Then, (1^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) => (B^2 + M^2 = 99).Looking for non-negative integers B, M such that their squares add to 99.Let me see: 99 is not a perfect square, so let's check possible squares less than 99:0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.Looking for two squares that add to 99.Let's try 81 + 18: 18 isn't a square.64 + 35: 35 isn't a square.49 + 50: 50 isn't a square.36 + 63: 63 isn't a square.25 + 74: 74 isn't a square.16 + 83: 83 isn't a square.9 + 90: 90 isn't a square.4 + 95: 95 isn't a square.1 + 98: 98 isn't a square.0 + 99: 99 isn't a square.Hmm, so no solutions for D=1.Case 3: D=2(2^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) => (B^2 + M^2 = 96).Looking for B, M such that their squares add to 96.Possible squares:0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.Check combinations:81 + 15: 15 not square.64 + 32: 32 not square.49 + 47: 47 not square.36 + 60: 60 not square.25 + 71: 71 not square.16 + 80: 80 not square.9 + 87: 87 not square.4 + 92: 92 not square.1 + 95: 95 not square.0 + 96: 96 not square.So, no solutions for D=2.Case 4: D=3(3^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) => (B^2 + M^2 = 91).Looking for B, M such that (B^2 + M^2 = 91).Check squares:81 + 10: 10 not square.64 + 27: 27 not square.49 + 42: 42 not square.36 + 55: 55 not square.25 + 66: 66 not square.16 + 75: 75 not square.9 + 82: 82 not square.4 + 87: 87 not square.1 + 90: 90 not square.0 + 91: 91 not square.No solutions for D=3.Case 5: D=4(4^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) => (B^2 + M^2 = 84).Looking for B, M such that (B^2 + M^2 = 84).Check squares:81 + 3: 3 not square.64 + 20: 20 not square.49 + 35: 35 not square.36 + 48: 48 not square.25 + 59: 59 not square.16 + 68: 68 not square.9 + 75: 75 not square.4 + 80: 80 not square.1 + 83: 83 not square.0 + 84: 84 not square.No solutions for D=4.Case 6: D=5(5^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) => (B^2 + M^2 = 75).Looking for B, M such that (B^2 + M^2 = 75).Check squares:64 + 11: 11 not square.49 + 26: 26 not square.36 + 39: 39 not square.25 + 50: 50 not square.16 + 59: 59 not square.9 + 66: 66 not square.4 + 71: 71 not square.1 + 74: 74 not square.0 + 75: 75 not square.Wait, 75 is not a square, so no solutions here either.Case 7: D=6(6^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) => (B^2 + M^2 = 64).Looking for B, M such that (B^2 + M^2 = 64).Possible pairs:0 + 64: (0,8), (8,0)16 + 48: 48 not square.25 + 39: 39 not square.36 + 28: 28 not square.49 + 15: 15 not square.64 + 0: same as above.Wait, 64 is 8^2, so (0,8) and (8,0).Also, 16 + 48: 48 isn't square.Wait, 16 is 4^2, but 48 isn't a square.Wait, 64 can be expressed as 64 + 0, 49 + 15, 36 + 28, 25 + 39, 16 + 48, 9 + 55, 4 + 60, 1 + 63, 0 + 64.But only 64 and 0 are squares. So, only (0,8) and (8,0).So, for D=6, possible (B,M) are (0,8) and (8,0).Now, check the sum (D + B + M):For (0,8): 6 + 0 + 8 = 14 < 15. Doesn't satisfy.For (8,0): 6 + 8 + 0 = 14 < 15. Doesn't satisfy.So, no solutions for D=6.Case 8: D=7(7^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) => (B^2 + M^2 = 51).Looking for B, M such that (B^2 + M^2 = 51).Check squares:49 + 2: 2 not square.36 + 15: 15 not square.25 + 26: 26 not square.16 + 35: 35 not square.9 + 42: 42 not square.4 + 47: 47 not square.1 + 50: 50 not square.0 + 51: 51 not square.No solutions for D=7.Case 9: D=8(8^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) => (B^2 + M^2 = 36).Looking for B, M such that (B^2 + M^2 = 36).Possible pairs:0 + 36: (0,6), (6,0)16 + 20: 20 not square.25 + 11: 11 not square.36 + 0: same as above.Also, 9 + 27: 27 not square.4 + 32: 32 not square.1 + 35: 35 not square.So, only (0,6) and (6,0).Check the sum (D + B + M):For (0,6): 8 + 0 + 6 = 14 < 15.For (6,0): 8 + 6 + 0 = 14 < 15.So, no solutions for D=8.Case 10: D=9(9^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) => (B^2 + M^2 = 19).Looking for B, M such that (B^2 + M^2 = 19).Possible squares:16 + 3: 3 not square.9 + 10: 10 not square.4 + 15: 15 not square.1 + 18: 18 not square.0 + 19: 19 not square.No solutions for D=9.Case 11: D=10(10^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) => (B^2 + M^2 = 0).So, B=0 and M=0.Check the sum: 10 + 0 + 0 = 10 < 15. Doesn't satisfy.So, D=10 doesn't work.Wait, so after going through all D from 0 to 10, none of them satisfy both the equation and the inequality? That can't be right. Maybe I missed something.Wait, let me double-check. For D=6, we had (B,M) as (0,8) and (8,0), sum was 14. For D=8, same thing. For D=0, same.Wait, but maybe I missed some pairs where B and M are both non-zero? Let me check for D=6 again.When D=6, (B^2 + M^2 = 64). So, besides (0,8) and (8,0), are there other pairs?Wait, 64 can also be expressed as 32 + 32, but 32 isn't a square. 16 + 48: 48 isn't square. 25 + 39: 39 isn't square. 49 + 15: 15 isn't square. So, no, only (0,8) and (8,0).Similarly, for D=8, (B^2 + M^2 = 36). So, (0,6), (6,0), and what else? 16 + 20: nope. 25 + 11: nope. So, only those.Wait, maybe I need to consider that D, B, M can be in any order. So, perhaps I can have different permutations.Wait, but in the cases above, I considered all possible D from 0 to 10, and for each D, found possible B and M. So, maybe the only possible triples are those with two zeros and one 10, or one 6 and one 8, but in all cases, the sum is 10 or 14, which is less than 15.Hmm, that suggests that there are no solutions where (D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100) and (D + B + M geq 15). But that seems odd because the problem says to find a set of solutions, implying that such solutions exist.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think differently.Perhaps instead of fixing D, I can consider that the sum of squares is 100, and the sum is at least 15. Maybe I can find triples where the sum is exactly 15 or more, and their squares add to 100.Let me try to find such triples.Let me list all possible triples (D, B, M) where D + B + M >=15 and D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100.Since D, B, M are non-negative integers, let's think about possible combinations.The maximum any of them can be is 10, as before.Let me consider that if one of them is 10, the others have to be 0, but as we saw, the sum is 10, which is less than 15.If one of them is 9, then the others have to satisfy (B^2 + M^2 = 19), which we saw has no solutions.If one is 8, then (B^2 + M^2 = 36), which gives (0,6), (6,0). Sum is 14, still less than 15.If one is 7, (B^2 + M^2 = 51), no solutions.If one is 6, (B^2 + M^2 = 64), which gives (0,8), (8,0). Sum is 14.If one is 5, (B^2 + M^2 = 75), no solutions.If one is 4, (B^2 + M^2 = 84), no solutions.If one is 3, (B^2 + M^2 = 91), no solutions.If one is 2, (B^2 + M^2 = 96), no solutions.If one is 1, (B^2 + M^2 = 99), no solutions.If one is 0, (B^2 + M^2 = 100), which gives (0,10), (10,0), (6,8), (8,6). Sum is 10 or 14.Wait, so none of these give a sum of at least 15. So, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem says to find a set of solutions, so maybe I'm missing something.Wait, perhaps I need to consider that D, B, M can be more than one non-zero. For example, maybe all three are non-zero.Let me think: suppose D, B, M are all at least 1. Then, their squares would be at least 1 each, so total sum of squares would be at least 3, but we have 100.But maybe the sum can be higher.Wait, let me try to find triples where all three are non-zero.Let me try D=6, B=8, M=0: sum is 14, which is less than 15.D=8, B=6, M=0: same.D=10, others 0: sum 10.What about D=7, B= something, M= something.Wait, D=7, then (B^2 + M^2 = 51). Let me see if 51 can be expressed as sum of two squares.Wait, 51 = 49 + 2, but 2 isn't a square.51 = 36 + 15: 15 isn't a square.51 = 25 + 26: 26 isn't a square.51 = 16 + 35: 35 isn't a square.51 = 9 + 42: 42 isn't a square.51 = 4 + 47: 47 isn't a square.51 = 1 + 50: 50 isn't a square.So, no solutions.What about D=5, then (B^2 + M^2 = 75). Let me see:75 = 64 + 11: 11 isn't square.75 = 49 + 26: 26 isn't square.75 = 36 + 39: 39 isn't square.75 = 25 + 50: 50 isn't square.75 = 16 + 59: 59 isn't square.75 = 9 + 66: 66 isn't square.75 = 4 + 71: 71 isn't square.75 = 1 + 74: 74 isn't square.So, no solutions.Wait, maybe I need to consider that two of them are non-zero and the third is non-zero as well, but not necessarily one being zero.Wait, let me think of D=4, then (B^2 + M^2 = 84). Let me see:84 = 81 + 3: 3 isn't square.84 = 64 + 20: 20 isn't square.84 = 49 + 35: 35 isn't square.84 = 36 + 48: 48 isn't square.84 = 25 + 59: 59 isn't square.84 = 16 + 68: 68 isn't square.84 = 9 + 75: 75 isn't square.84 = 4 + 80: 80 isn't square.84 = 1 + 83: 83 isn't square.So, no solutions.Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of possible triples where the sum is at least 15 and the sum of squares is 100.Let me try D=5, B=5, M=5. Sum is 15, which is good. Sum of squares is 25 + 25 + 25 = 75 < 100. Not enough.What about D=6, B=6, M=3. Sum is 15. Sum of squares: 36 + 36 + 9 = 81 < 100.D=7, B=5, M=3. Sum 15. Sum of squares: 49 + 25 + 9 = 83 < 100.D=8, B=4, M=3. Sum 15. Sum of squares: 64 + 16 + 9 = 89 < 100.D=9, B=3, M=3. Sum 15. Sum of squares: 81 + 9 + 9 = 99 < 100.D=10, B=2, M=3. Sum 15. Sum of squares: 100 + 4 + 9 = 113 > 100. Too much.Wait, so maybe if I increase some numbers.Wait, let me try D=7, B=6, M=2. Sum is 15. Sum of squares: 49 + 36 + 4 = 89 < 100.D=8, B=5, M=2. Sum 15. Sum of squares: 64 + 25 + 4 = 93 < 100.D=9, B=4, M=2. Sum 15. Sum of squares: 81 + 16 + 4 = 101 > 100. Close.D=9, B=4, M=1. Sum 14. Sum of squares: 81 + 16 + 1 = 98 < 100.D=9, B=5, M=1. Sum 15. Sum of squares: 81 + 25 + 1 = 107 > 100.D=8, B=6, M=1. Sum 15. Sum of squares: 64 + 36 + 1 = 101 > 100.D=7, B=7, M=1. Sum 15. Sum of squares: 49 + 49 + 1 = 99 < 100.D=7, B=8, M=0. Sum 15. Sum of squares: 49 + 64 + 0 = 113 > 100.Wait, so maybe D=7, B=7, M=1: sum of squares is 99, which is close to 100. But not quite.Wait, maybe D=6, B=8, M=0: sum of squares is 100, but sum is 14.Wait, but the problem says \\"at least 15\\", so maybe I need to find a triple where the sum is exactly 15 and sum of squares is 100, or more than 15.Wait, let me think of D=5, B=5, M=5: sum 15, sum of squares 75.If I increase D to 6, B=6, M=3: sum 15, sum of squares 81.If I increase D to 7, B=5, M=3: sum 15, sum of squares 83.If I increase D to 8, B=4, M=3: sum 15, sum of squares 89.If I increase D to 9, B=3, M=3: sum 15, sum of squares 99.If I increase D to 10, B=2, M=3: sum 15, sum of squares 113.Wait, so none of these give sum of squares exactly 100.Wait, maybe I need to have a sum greater than 15.Let me try D=6, B=7, M=2: sum 15. Sum of squares: 36 + 49 + 4 = 89.D=7, B=7, M=1: sum 15. Sum of squares 99.D=8, B=5, M=2: sum 15. Sum of squares 93.D=9, B=4, M=2: sum 15.

Sum of squares 64 + 25 + 9 = 98.Still less than 100.D=8, B=6, M=2: sum 16. Sum of squares 64 + 36 + 4 = 104 > 100.Too much.D=7, B=6, M=3: sum 16. Sum of squares 49 + 36 + 9 = 94.D=7, B=7, M=2: sum 16. Sum of squares 49 + 49 + 4 = 102 > 100.D=6, B=7, M=3: sum 16. Sum of squares 36 + 49 + 9 = 94.D=6, B=8, M=2: sum 16. Sum of squares 36 + 64 + 4 = 104 > 100.Hmm, not helpful.Wait, maybe I need to consider that the sum is exactly 15 and sum of squares is 100.Is that possible?Let me set D + B + M = 15 and D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100.We can use the identity:((D + B + M)^2 = D^2 + B^2 + M^2 + 2(DB + DM + BM)).So, (15^2 = 100 + 2(DB + DM + BM)).225 = 100 + 2(DB + DM + BM).So, 2(DB + DM + BM) = 125.But 125 is odd, and the left side is even, so this is impossible.Therefore, there are no solutions where D + B + M = 15 and D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100.So, the sum must be greater than 15.Wait, but if the sum is greater than 15, say 16, let's see.Let me try D=8, B=5, M=3: sum 16.

But no, the problem specifies non-negative integers.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my earlier approach. Let me try to think of it differently.Let me consider that the sum of squares is 100, and the sum is at least 15.Let me list all possible triples (D, B, M) where D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100, and then check if their sum is >=15.From earlier, the possible triples are:- (0,0,10) sum=10- (0,10,0) sum=10- (10,0,0) sum=10- (0,6,8) sum=14- (0,8,6) sum=14- (6,0,8) sum=14- (6,8,0) sum=14- (8,0,6) sum=14- (8,6,0) sum=14So, all possible triples have sums of 10 or 14, which are both less than 15.Therefore, there are no solutions where D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100 and D + B + M >=15.But the problem says to find a set of solutions, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.Wait, perhaps the equation is D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100, and the inequality is D + B + M >=15. So, maybe the sum can be more than 15, but the sum of squares is exactly 100.But as we saw, when the sum is more than 15, the sum of squares tends to be more than 100.Wait, let me think of D=5, B=5, M=5: sum=15, sum of squares=75.If I increase D to 6, B=5, M=5: sum=16, sum of squares=36+25+25=86.Still less than 100.D=7, B=5, M=5: sum=17, sum of squares=49+25+25=99.Close.D=7, B=6, M=5: sum=18, sum of squares=49+36+25=110>100.Hmm.Wait, maybe D=6, B=6, M=6: sum=18, sum of squares=108>100.Wait, maybe D=5, B=6, M=6: sum=17, sum of squares=25+36+36=97<100.D=5, B=7, M=6: sum=18, sum of squares=25+49+36=110>100.Wait, maybe D=4, B=8, M=5: sum=17, sum of squares=16+64+25=105>100.Wait, D=4, B=7, M=6: sum=17, sum of squares=16+49+36=101>100.Wait, D=3, B=8, M=6: sum=17, sum of squares=9+64+36=109>100.Wait, D=3, B=7, M=7: sum=17, sum of squares=9+49+49=107>100.Wait, D=2, B=8, M=7: sum=17, sum of squares=4+64+49=117>100.Wait, D=1, B=8, M=8: sum=17, sum of squares=1+64+64=129>100.Wait, D=0, B=10, M=0: sum=10, sum of squares=100.Wait, so it seems that the only way to get sum of squares exactly 100 is with the triples I listed earlier, which have sums of 10 or 14, both less than 15.Therefore, there are no solutions where D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100 and D + B + M >=15.But the problem says to find a set of solutions, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.Wait, perhaps the equation is D^2 + B^2 + M^2 = 100, and the inequality is D + B + M >=15.

The price of each house in the complex can be modeled by the quadratic equation ( P(x) = -2x^2 + 10x + 200 ), where ( P(x) ) is the price in thousands of dollars and ( x ) is the number of additional features added to the base model of the house.1. Determine the number of additional features that would maximize the price of the house. What is the maximum price achieved?2. The real estate agent wants to ensure that the house price does not go below 190,000. For what range of ( x ) (number of additional features) does the house price remain above 190,000?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about a real estate agent in Clifton, NJ, who's looking at a pricing model for a new housing complex. The price of each house is given by the quadratic equation ( P(x) = -2x^2 + 10x + 200 ), where ( P(x) ) is in thousands of dollars and ( x ) is the number of additional features added to the base model. There are two parts to this problem: first, finding the number of additional features that would maximize the price and what that maximum price is; second, determining the range of ( x ) where the price stays above 190,000.Okay, starting with the first part. Since this is a quadratic equation, and the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola is the maximum point. So, to find the maximum price, I need to find the vertex of this quadratic function.I remember that for a quadratic function in the form ( ax^2 + bx + c ), the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ). Let me apply that here. In this equation, ( a = -2 ) and ( b = 10 ). Plugging those into the formula:( x = -frac{10}{2*(-2)} = -frac{10}{-4} = 2.5 ).Hmm, so the number of additional features that would maximize the price is 2.5. But wait, you can't have half a feature, right? So, does that mean the maximum occurs between 2 and 3 features? Or maybe the model allows for fractional features? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can just report 2.5 as the number, even though in reality, you'd have to choose either 2 or 3 features.But let's proceed. So, the x-value is 2.5. Now, to find the maximum price, I need to plug this back into the original equation ( P(x) ).Calculating ( P(2.5) ):First, ( x^2 = (2.5)^2 = 6.25 ).So, ( -2x^2 = -2 * 6.25 = -12.5 ).Next, ( 10x = 10 * 2.5 = 25 ).Adding the constant term, 200.So, putting it all together:( P(2.5) = -12.5 + 25 + 200 = ( -12.5 + 25 ) + 200 = 12.5 + 200 = 212.5 ).Therefore, the maximum price is 212,500. But wait, the question says ( P(x) ) is in thousands of dollars, so 212.5 thousand dollars is 212,500. That makes sense.So, part one is done: 2.5 additional features maximize the price at 212,500.Now, moving on to part two. The real estate agent wants the house price to not go below 190,000. So, we need to find the range of ( x ) where ( P(x) geq 190 ). Since ( P(x) ) is in thousands, 190 corresponds to 190,000 dollars, so we set up the inequality:( -2x^2 + 10x + 200 geq 190 ).Let me rewrite this as:( -2x^2 + 10x + 200 - 190 geq 0 )Simplifying:( -2x^2 + 10x + 10 geq 0 ).So, we have a quadratic inequality: ( -2x^2 + 10x + 10 geq 0 ).To solve this, I can first find the roots of the equation ( -2x^2 + 10x + 10 = 0 ), and then determine the intervals where the quadratic expression is non-negative.Alternatively, I can multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of ( x^2 ) positive, but I have to remember that multiplying an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. Let me try that.Multiplying both sides by -1:( 2x^2 - 10x - 10 leq 0 ).So now, the inequality is ( 2x^2 - 10x - 10 leq 0 ).Let me solve the equation ( 2x^2 - 10x - 10 = 0 ).Using the quadratic formula: ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ).Here, ( a = 2 ), ( b = -10 ), ( c = -10 ).Plugging in:( x = frac{-(-10) pm sqrt{(-10)^2 - 4*2*(-10)}}{2*2} )Simplify:( x = frac{10 pm sqrt{100 + 80}}{4} )( x = frac{10 pm sqrt{180}}{4} )Simplify ( sqrt{180} ). 180 is 36*5, so ( sqrt{180} = 6sqrt{5} ).So, ( x = frac{10 pm 6sqrt{5}}{4} ).Simplify numerator:( x = frac{10}{4} pm frac{6sqrt{5}}{4} )Which simplifies to:( x = frac{5}{2} pm frac{3sqrt{5}}{2} ).So, the two roots are:( x = frac{5 + 3sqrt{5}}{2} ) and ( x = frac{5 - 3sqrt{5}}{2} ).Calculating approximate values for these roots to understand the intervals.First, ( sqrt{5} ) is approximately 2.236.So, ( 3sqrt{5} ) is approximately 6.708.Therefore,( x = frac{5 + 6.708}{2} = frac{11.708}{2} = 5.854 ).And,( x = frac{5 - 6.708}{2} = frac{-1.708}{2} = -0.854 ).So, the roots are approximately at ( x = -0.854 ) and ( x = 5.854 ).Since ( x ) represents the number of additional features, it can't be negative. So, the relevant interval is from ( x = 0 ) to ( x = 5.854 ).But wait, the quadratic inequality we had after multiplying by -1 was ( 2x^2 - 10x - 10 leq 0 ). The quadratic opens upwards (since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive). So, the expression ( 2x^2 - 10x - 10 ) is less than or equal to zero between its two roots.Therefore, the solution to the inequality ( 2x^2 - 10x - 10 leq 0 ) is ( x ) between ( -0.854 ) and ( 5.854 ).But since ( x ) can't be negative, the relevant interval is ( 0 leq x leq 5.854 ).But remember, the original inequality was ( -2x^2 + 10x + 10 geq 0 ), which we transformed into ( 2x^2 - 10x - 10 leq 0 ). So, the solution is the same interval, ( x ) between approximately -0.854 and 5.854. But again, since ( x ) can't be negative, we only consider ( x ) from 0 to 5.854.Therefore, the house price remains above 190,000 when the number of additional features ( x ) is between 0 and approximately 5.854. Since the number of features must be a whole number, we can say ( x ) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6? Wait, 5.854 is approximately 5.85, so 5.85 is less than 6, so the maximum integer value is 5.Wait, hold on. Let me think again. The quadratic is ( P(x) = -2x^2 + 10x + 200 ). So, when ( x = 5 ), let's compute ( P(5) ):( P(5) = -2*(25) + 10*5 + 200 = -50 + 50 + 200 = 200 ). So, 200 thousand dollars, which is 200,000, which is above 190,000.What about ( x = 6 ):( P(6) = -2*(36) + 10*6 + 200 = -72 + 60 + 200 = (-72 + 60) + 200 = (-12) + 200 = 188 ). So, 188 thousand dollars, which is 188,000, below 190,000.So, at ( x = 6 ), the price drops below 190,000. Therefore, the maximum integer value of ( x ) where the price is still above 190,000 is 5.But wait, the quadratic equation solution gave us ( x ) up to approximately 5.854, which is between 5 and 6. So, if we're considering real numbers, ( x ) can be up to about 5.854, but since ( x ) is the number of features, which is a whole number, the maximum ( x ) is 5.But hold on, the question says \\"the house price does not go below 190,000. For what range of ( x ) (number of additional features) does the house price remain above 190,000?\\"So, they might be expecting a range in terms of real numbers, not necessarily integers. So, perhaps the answer is ( x ) between approximately -0.854 and 5.854, but since ( x ) can't be negative, it's 0 to approximately 5.854.But let me verify. Let's compute ( P(5.854) ):First, ( x = 5.854 ).Compute ( x^2 = (5.854)^2 approx 34.27 ).So, ( -2x^2 approx -68.54 ).( 10x = 58.54 ).Adding the constant term, 200.So, ( P(5.854) approx -68.54 + 58.54 + 200 = (-68.54 + 58.54) + 200 = (-10) + 200 = 190 ).So, at ( x approx 5.854 ), the price is exactly 190,000.Therefore, for ( x ) less than 5.854, the price is above 190,000. Since ( x ) can't be negative, the range is ( 0 leq x leq 5.854 ).But since the problem doesn't specify whether ( x ) has to be an integer, I think the answer should be in terms of real numbers. So, the range is from 0 to approximately 5.854.But let me write it in exact terms. The roots were ( x = frac{5 pm 3sqrt{5}}{2} ). So, the exact range is ( frac{5 - 3sqrt{5}}{2} leq x leq frac{5 + 3sqrt{5}}{2} ). But since ( frac{5 - 3sqrt{5}}{2} ) is negative, we can ignore that and say ( 0 leq x leq frac{5 + 3sqrt{5}}{2} ).But perhaps the question expects an exact answer in terms of radicals or an approximate decimal. Let me compute ( frac{5 + 3sqrt{5}}{2} ):( 3sqrt{5} approx 6.708 ), so ( 5 + 6.708 = 11.708 ), divided by 2 is approximately 5.854, as before.So, to wrap up part two, the house price remains above 190,000 when the number of additional features ( x ) is between 0 and approximately 5.854. Since ( x ) can't be negative, the range is ( 0 leq x leq frac{5 + 3sqrt{5}}{2} ) or approximately ( 0 leq x leq 5.854 ).But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, for part one, finding the vertex: correct, x = -b/(2a) = -10/(2*(-2)) = 2.5. Plugging back in, got 212.5, which is correct.For part two, setting up the inequality: correct, ( P(x) geq 190 ) becomes ( -2x^2 + 10x + 10 geq 0 ). Then, multiplying by -1 and flipping the inequality: correct, leading to ( 2x^2 - 10x -10 leq 0 ). Solving the quadratic equation: correct, got roots at approximately -0.854 and 5.854. Since ( x ) can't be negative, the range is 0 to 5.854. Testing integer values at x=5 and x=6: correct, x=5 gives 200, which is above 190, and x=6 gives 188, which is below 190.Therefore, the range is from 0 to approximately 5.854, but since the problem doesn't specify if ( x ) must be an integer, I think it's safe to present the exact value in terms of radicals or the approximate decimal.So, summarizing:1. The number of additional features that maximize the price is 2.5, and the maximum price is 212,500.2. The house price remains above 190,000 for ( x ) in the range from 0 to approximately 5.854 additional features.But let me write the exact form for part two as well, just to be thorough. The exact roots are ( x = frac{5 pm 3sqrt{5}}{2} ). So, the exact range is ( 0 leq x leq frac{5 + 3sqrt{5}}{2} ).I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident with these answers.**Final Answer**1. The number of additional features that maximize the price is boxed{2.5} and the maximum price is boxed{212.5} thousand dollars.2. The house price remains above 190,000 for ( x ) in the range boxed{left[0, frac{5 + 3sqrt{5}}{2}right]}."},{"question":"For what smallest natural number ( a ) are there exactly 50 perfect squares in the numerical interval ( (a, 3a) )?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest natural number ( a ) such that there are exactly 50 perfect squares in the interval ( (a, 3a) ). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We're looking for the smallest ( a ) where, if you consider all the numbers between ( a ) and ( 3a ) (but not including ( a ) and ( 3a ) themselves), there are exactly 50 perfect squares in that range. Got it.So, perfect squares are numbers like ( 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ) and so on. So, I need to count how many of these squares fall strictly between ( a ) and ( 3a ). And we want exactly 50 such squares.Let me think about how to model this. Suppose the smallest perfect square in the interval is ( n^2 ) and the largest is ( m^2 ). Then, the number of perfect squares in the interval would be ( m - n ). Because each integer from ( n ) to ( m ) squared gives a unique perfect square in that range.Wait, actually, it's ( m - n + 1 ) if both ( n^2 ) and ( m^2 ) are included. But since the interval is open, ( (a, 3a) ), we need to make sure that ( n^2 > a ) and ( m^2 < 3a ). So, maybe the count is ( m - n ) because we're excluding the endpoints.Hmm, let me clarify. If ( n^2 ) is the first square greater than ( a ), and ( m^2 ) is the last square less than ( 3a ), then the number of squares is ( m - n ). Because from ( n+1 ) to ( m ), each integer squared gives a square in the interval. So, the count is ( m - n ).But wait, actually, if ( n ) is the smallest integer such that ( n^2 > a ), and ( m ) is the largest integer such that ( m^2 < 3a ), then the number of squares is ( m - n + 1 ). Because you include both ( n ) and ( m ). Let me test this with an example.Suppose ( a = 1 ). Then ( 3a = 3 ). The interval is ( (1, 3) ). The perfect squares in this interval are ( 4 ) (which is ( 2^2 )), but wait, 4 is not less than 3. So, actually, there are no perfect squares in ( (1, 3) ). Hmm, okay. So, in this case, ( n ) would be 2 because ( 2^2 = 4 > 1 ), but ( m ) would be 1 because ( 1^2 = 1 < 3 ). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe my initial approach is flawed.Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of perfect squares in ( (a, 3a) ) is equal to the number of integers ( k ) such that ( a < k^2 < 3a ). So, ( k ) must satisfy ( sqrt{a} < k < sqrt{3a} ). Therefore, the number of such ( k ) is ( lfloor sqrt{3a} - 1 rfloor - lceil sqrt{a} + 1 rceil + 1 ). Hmm, maybe that's a more precise way to count.Wait, let me think again. If ( k ) is an integer such that ( k^2 ) is in ( (a, 3a) ), then ( k ) must satisfy ( sqrt{a} < k < sqrt{3a} ). So, the number of integers ( k ) is ( lfloor sqrt{3a} - 1 rfloor - lceil sqrt{a} + 1 rceil + 1 ). Hmm, maybe that's overcomplicating.Alternatively, the number of integers ( k ) is ( lfloor sqrt{3a} rfloor - lceil sqrt{a} rceil ). Let me test this with the previous example where ( a = 1 ). Then, ( sqrt{3a} = sqrt{3} approx 1.732 ), so ( lfloor sqrt{3a} rfloor = 1 ). ( sqrt{a} = 1 ), so ( lceil sqrt{a} rceil = 1 ). Therefore, the number of integers ( k ) is ( 1 - 1 = 0 ), which is correct because there are no perfect squares in ( (1, 3) ).Another example: let ( a = 2 ). Then, ( 3a = 6 ). The interval is ( (2, 6) ). The perfect squares in this interval are ( 4 ). So, only one perfect square. Let's compute ( lfloor sqrt{6} rfloor = 2 ) and ( lceil sqrt{2} rceil = 2 ). So, ( 2 - 2 = 0 ). Wait, that's not correct because there is one perfect square. Hmm, so maybe my formula is wrong.Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ( lfloor sqrt{3a} rfloor - lceil sqrt{a} rceil ). But in this case, ( sqrt{3a} = sqrt{6} approx 2.449 ), so ( lfloor sqrt{3a} rfloor = 2 ). ( sqrt{a} = sqrt{2} approx 1.414 ), so ( lceil sqrt{a} rceil = 2 ). Then, ( 2 - 2 = 0 ). But in reality, there is one perfect square. So, my formula is undercounting.Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Let me think. If ( k ) must satisfy ( sqrt{a} < k < sqrt{3a} ), then the number of integers ( k ) is ( lfloor sqrt{3a} - 1 rfloor - lceil sqrt{a} rceil + 1 ). Let me test this.For ( a = 2 ), ( sqrt{3a} = sqrt{6} approx 2.449 ), so ( lfloor sqrt{3a} - 1 rfloor = lfloor 1.449 rfloor = 1 ). ( lceil sqrt{a} rceil = 2 ). So, ( 1 - 2 + 1 = 0 ). Still not correct.Wait, maybe I need to consider that ( k ) must be strictly greater than ( sqrt{a} ) and strictly less than ( sqrt{3a} ). So, the number of integers ( k ) is ( lfloor sqrt{3a} - 1 rfloor - lceil sqrt{a} rceil + 1 ). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as ( lfloor sqrt{3a} rfloor - lceil sqrt{a} rceil ). Let's test this with ( a = 2 ). ( sqrt{3a} approx 2.449 ), so ( lfloor sqrt{3a} rfloor = 2 ). ( sqrt{a} approx 1.414 ), so ( lceil sqrt{a} rceil = 2 ). Thus, ( 2 - 2 = 0 ). But we know there is one perfect square, ( 4 ), in ( (2, 6) ). So, this formula is not working.Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ( lfloor sqrt{3a} rfloor - lceil sqrt{a} rceil ). But in this case, it's 2 - 2 = 0. Hmm.Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let's denote ( n ) as the smallest integer such that ( n^2 > a ), and ( m ) as the largest integer such that ( m^2 < 3a ). Then, the number of perfect squares in ( (a, 3a) ) is ( m - n + 1 ). Let's test this.For ( a = 2 ), ( n ) is 2 because ( 2^2 = 4 > 2 ). ( m ) is 2 because ( 2^2 = 4 < 6 ). So, ( m - n + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1 ). Correct, because there's one perfect square, 4.Another test: ( a = 1 ). ( n = 2 ) because ( 2^2 = 4 > 1 ). ( m = 1 ) because ( 1^2 = 1 < 3 ). Wait, but ( m ) is 1, which is less than ( n = 2 ). So, ( m - n + 1 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0 ). Correct, because there are no perfect squares in ( (1, 3) ).Another test: ( a = 4 ). Then, ( 3a = 12 ). The interval is ( (4, 12) ). Perfect squares in this interval are ( 9 ). So, only one perfect square. Let's compute ( n ) and ( m ). ( n ) is the smallest integer such that ( n^2 > 4 ). That's 3, since ( 3^2 = 9 > 4 ). ( m ) is the largest integer such that ( m^2 < 12 ). That's 3, since ( 3^2 = 9 < 12 ). So, ( m - n + 1 = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1 ). Correct.Another test: ( a = 5 ). ( 3a = 15 ). The interval is ( (5, 15) ). Perfect squares: ( 9 ) and ( 16 ) is excluded because 16 > 15. So, only one perfect square. Let's compute ( n ) and ( m ). ( n ) is the smallest integer such that ( n^2 > 5 ). That's 3, since ( 3^2 = 9 > 5 ). ( m ) is the largest integer such that ( m^2 < 15 ). That's 3, since ( 3^2 = 9 < 15 ). So, ( m - n + 1 = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1 ). Correct.Wait, but if ( a = 9 ), ( 3a = 27 ). The interval is ( (9, 27) ). Perfect squares in this interval are ( 16, 25 ). So, two perfect squares. Let's compute ( n ) and ( m ). ( n ) is the smallest integer such that ( n^2 > 9 ). That's 4, since ( 4^2 = 16 > 9 ). ( m ) is the largest integer such that ( m^2 < 27 ). That's 5, since ( 5^2 = 25 < 27 ). So, ( m - n + 1 = 5 - 4 + 1 = 2 ). Correct.So, this formula seems to work: the number of perfect squares in ( (a, 3a) ) is ( m - n + 1 ), where ( n = lceil sqrt{a} rceil + 1 ) if ( sqrt{a} ) is integer, otherwise ( n = lceil sqrt{a} rceil ). Wait, no. Actually, ( n ) is the smallest integer such that ( n^2 > a ). So, ( n = lfloor sqrt{a} rfloor + 1 ). Similarly, ( m ) is the largest integer such that ( m^2 < 3a ), so ( m = lfloor sqrt{3a - 1} rfloor ). Hmm, maybe.Wait, let's formalize this. Let me denote ( n = lfloor sqrt{a} rfloor + 1 ). Because ( lfloor sqrt{a} rfloor ) is the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to ( a ). So, adding 1 gives the smallest integer whose square is greater than ( a ). Similarly, ( m = lfloor sqrt{3a - 1} rfloor ). Because ( m ) is the largest integer such that ( m^2 < 3a ). So, ( m = lfloor sqrt{3a - 1} rfloor ).Therefore, the number of perfect squares in ( (a, 3a) ) is ( m - n + 1 ). So, ( m - n + 1 = 50 ). Therefore, ( lfloor sqrt{3a - 1} rfloor - (lfloor sqrt{a} rfloor + 1) + 1 = 50 ). Simplifying, ( lfloor sqrt{3a - 1} rfloor - lfloor sqrt{a} rfloor - 1 + 1 = 50 ). So, ( lfloor sqrt{3a - 1} rfloor - lfloor sqrt{a} rfloor = 50 ).So, our equation is ( lfloor sqrt{3a - 1} rfloor - lfloor sqrt{a} rfloor = 50 ). We need to find the smallest natural number ( a ) satisfying this.Let me denote ( k = lfloor sqrt{a} rfloor ). Then, ( k leq sqrt{a} < k + 1 ). So, ( k^2 leq a < (k + 1)^2 ).Similarly, ( lfloor sqrt{3a - 1} rfloor = k + 50 ). Let me denote ( m = lfloor sqrt{3a - 1} rfloor = k + 50 ). So, ( m leq sqrt{3a - 1} < m + 1 ). Therefore, ( m^2 leq 3a - 1 < (m + 1)^2 ). So, ( m^2 + 1 leq 3a < (m + 1)^2 + 1 ).But since ( m = k + 50 ), we can write ( (k + 50)^2 + 1 leq 3a < (k + 51)^2 + 1 ).But we also have ( k^2 leq a < (k + 1)^2 ). So, combining these inequalities:From ( a geq k^2 ), we have ( 3a geq 3k^2 ). From ( 3a geq (k + 50)^2 + 1 ), so ( 3k^2 leq (k + 50)^2 + 1 ). Let me compute this:( 3k^2 leq (k + 50)^2 + 1 )Expanding the right-hand side:( 3k^2 leq k^2 + 100k + 2500 + 1 )Simplify:( 3k^2 leq k^2 + 100k + 2501 )Subtract ( k^2 + 100k + 2501 ) from both sides:( 2k^2 - 100k - 2501 leq 0 )This is a quadratic inequality in terms of ( k ). Let's solve for ( k ):( 2k^2 - 100k - 2501 leq 0 )First, find the roots of the quadratic equation ( 2k^2 - 100k - 2501 = 0 ).Using the quadratic formula:( k = frac{100 pm sqrt{(100)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot (-2501)}}{2 cdot 2} )Calculate discriminant:( D = 10000 + 20008 = 30008 )So, ( sqrt{30008} approx 173.23 ) (since ( 173^2 = 29929 ) and ( 174^2 = 30276 )). So, approximately 173.23.Thus,( k = frac{100 pm 173.23}{4} )We can ignore the negative root because ( k ) is positive.So, ( k = frac{100 + 173.23}{4} approx frac{273.23}{4} approx 68.3075 ).And the other root is ( frac{100 - 173.23}{4} approx frac{-73.23}{4} approx -18.3075 ), which we can ignore.So, the quadratic is less than or equal to zero between its roots. Since ( k ) is positive, the inequality ( 2k^2 - 100k - 2501 leq 0 ) holds for ( k ) between approximately ( -18.3075 ) and ( 68.3075 ). But since ( k ) is a positive integer, the inequality holds for ( k leq 68 ).Therefore, ( k leq 68 ).But we need to find the smallest ( a ), so we need the smallest ( k ) such that the conditions hold. Wait, actually, since ( k ) is related to ( a ), and ( a ) is to be minimized, I think we need to find the smallest ( k ) such that the inequalities are satisfied.Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let me think.We have ( m = k + 50 ), where ( m = lfloor sqrt{3a - 1} rfloor ) and ( k = lfloor sqrt{a} rfloor ).So, ( m = k + 50 ).Also, ( k^2 leq a < (k + 1)^2 ).And ( m^2 leq 3a - 1 < (m + 1)^2 ).Substituting ( m = k + 50 ):( (k + 50)^2 leq 3a - 1 < (k + 51)^2 ).So, adding 1 to all sides:( (k + 50)^2 + 1 leq 3a < (k + 51)^2 + 1 ).Divide by 3:( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} leq a < frac{(k + 51)^2 + 1}{3} ).But we also have ( k^2 leq a < (k + 1)^2 ).Therefore, ( a ) must satisfy both inequalities:( maxleft( k^2, frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} right) leq a < minleft( (k + 1)^2, frac{(k + 51)^2 + 1}{3} right) ).For such ( a ) to exist, the lower bound must be less than the upper bound. So,( maxleft( k^2, frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} right) < minleft( (k + 1)^2, frac{(k + 51)^2 + 1}{3} right) ).This condition must hold for some ( k ). So, let's find the smallest ( k ) such that this is true.Let me compute ( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} ) and compare it with ( k^2 ).Compute ( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} geq k^2 ):( (k + 50)^2 + 1 geq 3k^2 )Expand left side:( k^2 + 100k + 2500 + 1 geq 3k^2 )Simplify:( -2k^2 + 100k + 2501 geq 0 )Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality sign changes):( 2k^2 - 100k - 2501 leq 0 )Wait, this is the same quadratic inequality as before. So, the solution is ( k leq 68.3075 ). So, for ( k leq 68 ), ( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} geq k^2 ). Therefore, for ( k leq 68 ), the lower bound is ( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} ), and the upper bound is ( minleft( (k + 1)^2, frac{(k + 51)^2 + 1}{3} right) ).We need to find the smallest ( k ) such that ( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} < (k + 1)^2 ). Because if ( frac{(k + 51)^2 + 1}{3} < (k + 1)^2 ), then the upper bound is ( frac{(k + 51)^2 + 1}{3} ), otherwise, it's ( (k + 1)^2 ).Wait, perhaps it's better to find the smallest ( k ) such that ( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} < (k + 1)^2 ).Let me solve this inequality:( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} < (k + 1)^2 )Multiply both sides by 3:( (k + 50)^2 + 1 < 3(k + 1)^2 )Expand both sides:Left side: ( k^2 + 100k + 2500 + 1 = k^2 + 100k + 2501 )Right side: ( 3(k^2 + 2k + 1) = 3k^2 + 6k + 3 )Bring all terms to left side:( k^2 + 100k + 2501 - 3k^2 - 6k - 3 < 0 )Simplify:( -2k^2 + 94k + 2498 < 0 )Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality sign changes):( 2k^2 - 94k - 2498 > 0 )Solve quadratic inequality ( 2k^2 - 94k - 2498 > 0 ).First, find roots:( k = frac{94 pm sqrt{(94)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot (-2498)}}{2 cdot 2} )Compute discriminant:( D = 8836 + 19984 = 28820 )( sqrt{28820} approx 169.76 ) (since ( 169^2 = 28561 ) and ( 170^2 = 28900 )).So,( k = frac{94 pm 169.76}{4} )Positive root:( k = frac{94 + 169.76}{4} approx frac{263.76}{4} approx 65.94 )Negative root is irrelevant.So, the quadratic is positive when ( k < 65.94 ) or ( k > 65.94 ). Since ( k ) is positive, the inequality ( 2k^2 - 94k - 2498 > 0 ) holds when ( k > 65.94 ). So, approximately ( k > 66 ).Therefore, for ( k > 66 ), ( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} < (k + 1)^2 ). So, for ( k geq 67 ), the upper bound is ( (k + 1)^2 ), and the lower bound is ( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} ).But for ( k leq 66 ), the upper bound is ( frac{(k + 51)^2 + 1}{3} ), and the lower bound is ( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} ).Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this by considering that for each ( k ), the interval for ( a ) is ( [frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3}, frac{(k + 51)^2 + 1}{3}) ) intersected with ( [k^2, (k + 1)^2) ).But perhaps instead of getting bogged down in algebra, I can approximate.We have ( m = k + 50 ), so ( sqrt{3a - 1} approx m ), so ( 3a - 1 approx m^2 ), so ( a approx frac{m^2 + 1}{3} ).But ( a ) is also approximately ( k^2 ). So, ( k^2 approx frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} ).Let me set ( k^2 = frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} ) and solve for ( k ).Multiply both sides by 3:( 3k^2 = (k + 50)^2 + 1 )Expand:( 3k^2 = k^2 + 100k + 2500 + 1 )Simplify:( 2k^2 - 100k - 2501 = 0 )This is the same quadratic as before. So, the solution is ( k approx 68.3075 ).So, around ( k = 68 ), the two expressions ( k^2 ) and ( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} ) are approximately equal.Therefore, for ( k = 68 ), let's compute ( frac{(68 + 50)^2 + 1}{3} = frac{118^2 + 1}{3} = frac{13924 + 1}{3} = frac{13925}{3} approx 4641.6667 ).And ( k^2 = 68^2 = 4624 ). So, ( frac{(k + 50)^2 + 1}{3} approx 4641.6667 ) is greater than ( k^2 = 4624 ). So, for ( k = 68 ), the lower bound is approximately 4641.6667, and the upper bound is ( frac{(68 + 51)^2 + 1}{3} = frac{119^2 + 1}{3} = frac{14161 + 1}{3} = frac{14162}{3} approx 4720.6667 ). Also, ( (k + 1)^2 = 69^2 = 4761 ). So, the upper bound is the minimum of 4720.6667 and 4761, which is 4720.6667.Therefore, for ( k = 68 ), ( a ) must satisfy ( 4641.6667 leq a < 4720.6667 ). But ( a ) must also satisfy ( k^2 leq a < (k + 1)^2 ), which is ( 4624 leq a < 4761 ). So, the intersection is ( 4641.6667 leq a < 4720.6667 ).So, the smallest ( a ) in this range is approximately 4642. But ( a ) must be an integer, so ( a = 4642 ).But wait, let's check if ( a = 4642 ) satisfies the original condition.Compute ( sqrt{a} = sqrt{4642} approx 68.13 ). So, ( k = lfloor sqrt{4642} rfloor = 68 ).Compute ( sqrt{3a - 1} = sqrt{3 times 4642 - 1} = sqrt{13926 - 1} = sqrt{13925} approx 118.01 ). So, ( m = lfloor sqrt{13925} rfloor = 118 ).Then, the number of perfect squares is ( m - k = 118 - 68 = 50 ). Wait, but earlier we had the formula ( m - n + 1 ). Wait, no, earlier we had ( m - k = 50 ). Hmm, but in our earlier example, we had ( m - n + 1 ). Wait, no, actually, in the initial problem, the number of perfect squares is ( m - k ). Because ( n = k + 1 ), so ( m - (k + 1) + 1 = m - k ).Wait, let me clarify. If ( n = lfloor sqrt{a} rfloor + 1 = 68 + 1 = 69 ), and ( m = lfloor sqrt{3a - 1} rfloor = 118 ). Then, the number of perfect squares is ( m - n + 1 = 118 - 69 + 1 = 50 ). Yes, that's correct.So, for ( a = 4642 ), the number of perfect squares in ( (4642, 13926) ) is 50.But we need to check if ( a = 4642 ) is indeed the smallest such ( a ). Let's check ( a = 4641 ).Compute ( sqrt{4641} approx 68.12 ). So, ( k = 68 ).Compute ( sqrt{3 times 4641 - 1} = sqrt{13923 - 1} = sqrt{13922} approx 118.00 ). So, ( m = 118 ).Number of perfect squares: ( 118 - 68 = 50 ). Wait, but ( a = 4641 ), let's check if ( 69^2 = 4761 ) is greater than ( a = 4641 ). Yes, 4761 > 4641. So, ( n = 69 ). ( m = 118 ). So, number of squares is ( 118 - 69 + 1 = 50 ). So, ( a = 4641 ) also satisfies the condition.Wait, so maybe ( a = 4641 ) is smaller than 4642 and still satisfies the condition. So, perhaps I need to go lower.Wait, let me check ( a = 4641 ). The interval is ( (4641, 13923) ). The smallest perfect square greater than 4641 is ( 69^2 = 4761 ). The largest perfect square less than 13923 is ( 118^2 = 13924 ), but 13924 is greater than 13923, so the largest perfect square less than 13923 is ( 117^2 = 13689 ). Wait, hold on.Wait, ( 118^2 = 13924 ), which is greater than 13923, so the largest perfect square less than 13923 is ( 117^2 = 13689 ). So, the perfect squares in ( (4641, 13923) ) are from ( 69^2 ) to ( 117^2 ). So, the number of perfect squares is ( 117 - 69 + 1 = 49 ). Wait, that's only 49. So, ( a = 4641 ) gives only 49 perfect squares, which is less than 50. Therefore, ( a = 4641 ) is invalid.Wait, so my earlier calculation was wrong because I assumed ( m = 118 ), but actually, ( 118^2 = 13924 ) is greater than ( 3a - 1 = 13923 ), so ( m = 117 ). Therefore, the number of perfect squares is ( 117 - 69 + 1 = 49 ). So, ( a = 4641 ) is invalid.Therefore, the smallest ( a ) is 4642.Wait, let me confirm for ( a = 4642 ). The interval is ( (4642, 13926) ). The smallest perfect square greater than 4642 is ( 69^2 = 4761 ). The largest perfect square less than 13926 is ( 118^2 = 13924 ). So, the perfect squares in this interval are from ( 69^2 ) to ( 118^2 ). Therefore, the number of perfect squares is ( 118 - 69 + 1 = 50 ). Correct.So, ( a = 4642 ) is valid.But is there a smaller ( a ) that also gives exactly 50 perfect squares? Let's check ( a = 4642 - 1 = 4641 ), which we saw gives only 49. What about ( a = 4642 - 2 = 4640 )?Compute ( sqrt{4640} approx 68.11 ), so ( k = 68 ).Compute ( sqrt{3 times 4640 - 1} = sqrt{13920 - 1} = sqrt{13919} approx 118.00 ). So, ( m = 118 ).But ( 118^2 = 13924 ), which is greater than ( 3a - 1 = 13919 ). So, ( m = 117 ).Therefore, the number of perfect squares is ( 117 - 69 + 1 = 49 ). So, ( a = 4640 ) is invalid.Similarly, ( a = 4642 ) is the smallest ( a ) where the number of perfect squares in ( (a, 3a) ) is exactly 50.Wait, but let me check ( a = 4642 ). Is there a perfect square equal to ( 3a )? ( 3a = 13926 ). ( sqrt{13926} approx 118.00 ). ( 118^2 = 13924 ), which is less than 13926. So, ( 118^2 ) is included in the interval ( (4642, 13926) ). So, yes, 118^2 is included.Wait, but if ( a = 4642 ), then ( 3a = 13926 ). So, the interval is ( (4642, 13926) ). So, ( 118^2 = 13924 ) is less than 13926, so it's included. Therefore, the count is correct.Therefore, the smallest ( a ) is 4642.But let me check ( a = 4642 ). Is there a smaller ( a ) where the count is 50? For example, if ( a ) is slightly less than 4642, say 4642 - x, where x is a small integer, does the count remain 50?Wait, let's consider ( a = 4642 - x ), where ( x ) is such that ( a ) is still above ( 68^2 = 4624 ). So, ( x ) can be up to 17 (since 4642 - 17 = 4625, which is still above 4624).Let me pick ( a = 4642 - 10 = 4632 ). Compute ( sqrt{4632} approx 68.06 ), so ( k = 68 ).Compute ( sqrt{3 times 4632 - 1} = sqrt{13896 - 1} = sqrt{13895} approx 117.88 ). So, ( m = 117 ).Therefore, the number of perfect squares is ( 117 - 69 + 1 = 49 ). So, ( a = 4632 ) is invalid.Similarly, if I take ( a = 4642 - 1 = 4641 ), as before, it gives 49.Therefore, ( a = 4642 ) is indeed the smallest ( a ) such that the interval ( (a, 3a) ) contains exactly 50 perfect squares.Wait, but let me check ( a = 4642 ). The perfect squares in ( (4642, 13926) ) are from ( 69^2 = 4761 ) to ( 118^2 = 13924 ). So, the number of squares is ( 118 - 69 + 1 = 50 ). Correct.But let me check ( a = 4642 ). Is ( 69^2 = 4761 > 4642 )? Yes. Is ( 118^2 = 13924 < 13926 )? Yes. So, all squares from 69^2 to 118^2 are included, which is 50 squares.Therefore, the smallest ( a ) is 4642.But wait, let me check ( a = 4642 ). Is there a smaller ( a ) where the count is still 50? For example, if ( a ) is such that ( 69^2 ) is just above ( a ), and ( 118^2 ) is just below ( 3a ).Wait, suppose ( a ) is just below 4761, but that would make ( k = 68 ), and ( m = 118 ). But if ( a ) is too small, then ( 3a ) might not reach ( 118^2 ).Wait, let me think differently. Let's find the minimal ( a ) such that ( 69^2 > a ) and ( 118^2 < 3a ).So, ( a < 69^2 = 4761 ) and ( 3a > 118^2 = 13924 ). So, ( a > 13924 / 3 ≈ 4641.333 ).Therefore, ( a ) must satisfy ( 4641.333 < a < 4761 ).Since ( a ) must be an integer, the smallest ( a ) is 4642.Yes, that makes sense. So, the minimal ( a ) is 4642.**Final Answer**The smallest natural number ( a ) is boxed{4642}."},{"question":"As a retired professional wrestler turned critic, you have been analyzing the outcomes of wrestling matches. You are particularly interested in exposing the scripted nature of certain matchups. Suppose you are reviewing a series of matches where the probability of a wrestler's victory in a scripted match is modeled by the polynomial function ( P(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 1 ), where ( x ) represents the number of scripted elements in the match.1. Determine the real roots of the polynomial ( P(x) ) to identify the number of scripted elements that lead to a zero probability of a wrestler's victory.2. If the probability of victory must be greater than 0.5 for a match to be considered genuinely competitive, find the range of ( x ) values that satisfy the inequality ( P(x) > 0.5 ). Analyze whether a genuinely competitive match is possible based on this model.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a polynomial that models the probability of a wrestler's victory in a scripted match. The polynomial is given as ( P(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 1 ), where ( x ) is the number of scripted elements. The first part asks me to determine the real roots of this polynomial. Real roots would be the values of ( x ) where ( P(x) = 0 ), which means the probability of victory is zero. So, I need to solve the equation ( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0 ).Hmm, solving a cubic equation. I remember that for polynomials, especially cubics, there are methods to find roots. Maybe I can try rational root theorem first. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient. The constant term here is -1, and the leading coefficient is 2. So possible rational roots are ( pm1, pmfrac{1}{2} ).Let me test these values in the polynomial.First, let's try ( x = 1 ):( P(1) = 2(1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 3(1) - 1 = 2 - 5 + 3 - 1 = -1 ). Not zero.Next, ( x = -1 ):( P(-1) = 2(-1)^3 - 5(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 1 = -2 - 5 - 3 - 1 = -11 ). Not zero.How about ( x = frac{1}{2} ):( P(frac{1}{2}) = 2(frac{1}{2})^3 - 5(frac{1}{2})^2 + 3(frac{1}{2}) - 1 = 2(frac{1}{8}) - 5(frac{1}{4}) + frac{3}{2} - 1 = frac{1}{4} - frac{5}{4} + frac{3}{2} - 1 ).Calculating each term:( frac{1}{4} - frac{5}{4} = -1 ),( frac{3}{2} - 1 = frac{1}{2} ),So total is ( -1 + frac{1}{2} = -frac{1}{2} ). Not zero.Next, ( x = -frac{1}{2} ):( P(-frac{1}{2}) = 2(-frac{1}{2})^3 - 5(-frac{1}{2})^2 + 3(-frac{1}{2}) - 1 = 2(-frac{1}{8}) - 5(frac{1}{4}) - frac{3}{2} - 1 = -frac{1}{4} - frac{5}{4} - frac{3}{2} - 1 ).Calculating each term:( -frac{1}{4} - frac{5}{4} = -frac{6}{4} = -frac{3}{2} ),( -frac{3}{2} - 1 = -frac{5}{2} ).Total is ( -frac{3}{2} - frac{5}{2} = -4 ). Not zero.So none of the rational roots work. Hmm, that means either the polynomial doesn't have rational roots or I made a mistake. Let me double-check my calculations.Wait, for ( x = 1 ), I had ( 2 - 5 + 3 - 1 = -1 ). That seems correct. For ( x = frac{1}{2} ), let me recalculate:( 2*(1/8) = 1/4 ),( -5*(1/4) = -5/4 ),( 3*(1/2) = 3/2 ),( -1 ).So, 1/4 - 5/4 = -1, 3/2 - 1 = 1/2, so total is -1 + 1/2 = -1/2. Correct.Hmm, so no rational roots. Maybe I need to use another method. Perhaps factoring by grouping, but looking at the polynomial:( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 1 ).Let me try grouping:Group as (2x^3 - 5x^2) + (3x - 1).Factor out x^2 from the first group: x^2(2x - 5) + (3x - 1). Doesn't seem helpful.Alternatively, maybe try synthetic division or use the cubic formula. But since it's a cubic, there must be at least one real root. Maybe I can approximate it.Alternatively, maybe I can use the rational root theorem incorrectly? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the possible roots. The possible roots are factors of 1 over factors of 2, so ±1, ±1/2. I think I covered all.Alternatively, maybe I can use the derivative to find critical points and see where the function crosses zero.Wait, maybe I can graph the function or use the intermediate value theorem to see where the roots lie.Let me evaluate P(x) at some integer points.We already saw P(1) = -1, P(0) = -1, P(2) = 2*(8) - 5*(4) + 3*(2) -1 = 16 - 20 + 6 -1 = 1. So P(2) = 1.So between x=1 and x=2, the function goes from -1 to 1, so by intermediate value theorem, there is a root between 1 and 2.Similarly, let's check x=3: P(3)=2*27 -5*9 +3*3 -1=54-45+9-1=17. So positive.x= -1: P(-1)= -2 -5 -3 -1=-11.x= -2: P(-2)= 2*(-8) -5*(4) +3*(-2) -1= -16 -20 -6 -1= -43.So, the function is negative at x=-2, -1, 0, 1, and positive at x=2,3.So only one real root between 1 and 2.Wait, but cubic functions have either one or three real roots. Since we only found one crossing from negative to positive between 1 and 2, and the function tends to infinity as x approaches infinity and negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity, so maybe only one real root.But let me check the derivative to see if there are any turning points.The derivative P’(x)=6x² -10x +3.Set derivative to zero: 6x² -10x +3=0.Using quadratic formula: x=(10±sqrt(100-72))/12=(10±sqrt(28))/12=(10±2*sqrt(7))/12=(5±sqrt(7))/6.So approximately, sqrt(7)=2.6458, so roots at (5+2.6458)/6≈7.6458/6≈1.274 and (5-2.6458)/6≈2.3542/6≈0.392.So the function has critical points at approximately x≈0.392 and x≈1.274.So, let's compute P(0.392):x≈0.392,P(x)=2*(0.392)^3 -5*(0.392)^2 +3*(0.392) -1.Calculate each term:0.392^3≈0.392*0.392=0.153664, then *0.392≈0.0602.2*0.0602≈0.1204.0.392^2≈0.153664,-5*0.153664≈-0.7683.3*0.392≈1.176.So total: 0.1204 -0.7683 +1.176 -1≈0.1204 -0.7683= -0.6479; -0.6479 +1.176≈0.5281; 0.5281 -1≈-0.4719.So P(0.392)≈-0.4719.Similarly, P(1.274):x≈1.274,Compute P(x)=2*(1.274)^3 -5*(1.274)^2 +3*(1.274) -1.First, 1.274^2≈1.623,1.274^3≈1.274*1.623≈2.066.So,2*2.066≈4.132,-5*1.623≈-8.115,3*1.274≈3.822,-1.Total: 4.132 -8.115≈-3.983; -3.983 +3.822≈-0.161; -0.161 -1≈-1.161.Wait, that can't be right because earlier we saw that P(2)=1, so between x=1.274 and x=2, the function goes from -1.161 to 1, so another crossing. But wait, earlier I thought only one real root, but maybe there are three?Wait, let me check P(1.274)= approximately -1.161, which is less than zero, and P(2)=1, so another root between 1.274 and 2.But wait, the function was negative at x=1 (P(1)=-1), negative at x=0.392 (≈-0.4719), negative at x=1.274 (≈-1.161), and positive at x=2.So, the function crosses from negative to positive between x=1.274 and x=2, so that's one real root.But wait, the function also goes from negative infinity at x approaching negative infinity, and at x=0, P(0)=-1, so it's negative there. So, maybe only one real root? Or is there another crossing?Wait, let me check P(-1)= -11, P(0)=-1, P(1)=-1, P(2)=1, P(3)=17.So, the function is negative from x=-infty to x=1, then crosses to positive at x≈1.274 to x=2, but wait, the function is negative at x=1.274, so it must have crossed from negative to positive between x=1.274 and x=2.But wait, the function is negative at x=1.274, which is a local minimum, and then increases to positive at x=2. So, only one real root between 1.274 and 2.But wait, the derivative has two critical points, so the function has a local maximum at x≈0.392 and a local minimum at x≈1.274.So, the function comes from negative infinity, increases to a local maximum at x≈0.392, which is still negative, then decreases to a local minimum at x≈1.274, which is even more negative, and then increases again to positive infinity.Therefore, the function only crosses the x-axis once, between x≈1.274 and x=2.So, only one real root.Therefore, the real root is between 1.274 and 2. To find it more precisely, maybe use the Newton-Raphson method.Let me take an initial guess at x=1.5.Compute P(1.5)=2*(3.375) -5*(2.25) +3*(1.5) -1=6.75 -11.25 +4.5 -1= (6.75 -11.25)= -4.5; (-4.5 +4.5)=0; 0 -1= -1.So P(1.5)= -1.Wait, that's interesting. So at x=1.5, P(x)=-1.Wait, but we know P(2)=1, so between 1.5 and 2, the function goes from -1 to 1, so crosses zero somewhere there.Let me try x=1.75.P(1.75)=2*(1.75)^3 -5*(1.75)^2 +3*(1.75) -1.1.75^2=3.0625,1.75^3=5.359375,So,2*5.359375=10.71875,-5*3.0625= -15.3125,3*1.75=5.25,-1.Total: 10.71875 -15.3125= -4.59375; -4.59375 +5.25=0.65625; 0.65625 -1= -0.34375.So P(1.75)= -0.34375.Still negative.Next, x=1.875.P(1.875)=2*(1.875)^3 -5*(1.875)^2 +3*(1.875) -1.1.875^2=3.515625,1.875^3=6.591796875,So,2*6.591796875=13.18359375,-5*3.515625= -17.578125,3*1.875=5.625,-1.Total: 13.18359375 -17.578125= -4.39453125; -4.39453125 +5.625=1.23046875; 1.23046875 -1=0.23046875.So P(1.875)=≈0.2305.So between x=1.75 and x=1.875, P(x) goes from -0.34375 to 0.2305. So the root is between 1.75 and 1.875.Let me use linear approximation.The change in x is 0.125, and the change in P(x) is 0.2305 - (-0.34375)=0.57425.We need to find delta_x such that P(x)=0.From x=1.75, P=-0.34375.So delta_x= (0 - (-0.34375))/0.57425 *0.125≈(0.34375/0.57425)*0.125≈0.598*0.125≈0.07475.So approximate root at x≈1.75 +0.07475≈1.82475.Let me compute P(1.82475).1.82475^2≈3.329,1.82475^3≈1.82475*3.329≈6.082.So,2*6.082≈12.164,-5*3.329≈-16.645,3*1.82475≈5.474,-1.Total: 12.164 -16.645≈-4.481; -4.481 +5.474≈0.993; 0.993 -1≈-0.007.So P(1.82475)≈-0.007.Almost zero. Let me try x=1.825.Compute P(1.825):1.825^2=3.330625,1.825^3=1.825*3.330625≈6.084375.So,2*6.084375=12.16875,-5*3.330625= -16.653125,3*1.825=5.475,-1.Total: 12.16875 -16.653125≈-4.484375; -4.484375 +5.475≈0.990625; 0.990625 -1≈-0.009375.Wait, that's worse. Maybe my approximation was off.Wait, at x=1.82475, P≈-0.007, and at x=1.875, P≈0.2305.So, let's try x=1.825:Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error.Wait, 1.825^3: 1.825*1.825=3.330625, then 3.330625*1.825.Let me compute 3.330625*1.825:First, 3*1.825=5.475,0.330625*1.825≈0.330625*1.8=0.595125, 0.330625*0.025≈0.008265625, so total≈0.595125+0.008265625≈0.603390625.So total 3.330625*1.825≈5.475 +0.603390625≈6.078390625.So, 2*6.078390625≈12.15678125,-5*3.330625≈-16.653125,3*1.825≈5.475,-1.Total: 12.15678125 -16.653125≈-4.49634375; -4.49634375 +5.475≈0.97865625; 0.97865625 -1≈-0.02134375.Wait, that's different from before. Maybe my initial calculation was wrong.Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.Alternatively, maybe use Newton-Raphson method.Let me take x0=1.875, where P(x0)=0.23046875.Compute P'(x0)=6x0² -10x0 +3.x0=1.875,x0²=3.515625,So P'(x0)=6*3.515625 -10*1.875 +3=21.09375 -18.75 +3=5.34375.Newton-Raphson update: x1=x0 - P(x0)/P'(x0)=1.875 - (0.23046875)/5.34375≈1.875 -0.0431≈1.8319.Compute P(1.8319):1.8319^2≈3.356,1.8319^3≈1.8319*3.356≈6.146.So,2*6.146≈12.292,-5*3.356≈-16.78,3*1.8319≈5.4957,-1.Total: 12.292 -16.78≈-4.488; -4.488 +5.4957≈1.0077; 1.0077 -1≈0.0077.So P(1.8319)=≈0.0077.Close to zero. Now, compute P'(1.8319)=6*(1.8319)^2 -10*(1.8319)+3.1.8319^2≈3.356,So 6*3.356≈20.136,-10*1.8319≈-18.319,+3.Total≈20.136 -18.319 +3≈4.817.So P'(1.8319)=≈4.817.Next iteration: x2=x1 - P(x1)/P'(x1)=1.8319 - 0.0077/4.817≈1.8319 -0.0016≈1.8303.Compute P(1.8303):1.8303^2≈3.350,1.8303^3≈1.8303*3.350≈6.133.So,2*6.133≈12.266,-5*3.350≈-16.75,3*1.8303≈5.4909,-1.Total: 12.266 -16.75≈-4.484; -4.484 +5.4909≈1.0069; 1.0069 -1≈0.0069.Wait, that's similar to before. Maybe I need more precise calculations.Alternatively, perhaps accept that the root is approximately 1.83.So, the real root is approximately x≈1.83.Therefore, the number of scripted elements that lead to zero probability is approximately 1.83. But since x represents the number of scripted elements, which is likely an integer, but the model allows x to be a real number. So, the exact real root is approximately 1.83.But perhaps I can express it more accurately. Alternatively, maybe factor the polynomial.Wait, since we know that x≈1.83 is a root, perhaps factor out (x - 1.83) and find the other roots.But since it's a cubic, if there's only one real root, the other two are complex.Alternatively, perhaps use polynomial division.But since I don't have an exact root, it's difficult.Alternatively, maybe use the cubic formula, but that's complicated.Alternatively, accept that the real root is approximately 1.83.So, for part 1, the real root is approximately x≈1.83.Now, moving to part 2: find the range of x where P(x) > 0.5.So, solve 2x^3 -5x^2 +3x -1 > 0.5.Subtract 0.5: 2x^3 -5x^2 +3x -1.5 >0.Let me define Q(x)=2x^3 -5x^2 +3x -1.5.We need to find where Q(x) >0.Again, perhaps find the roots of Q(x)=0.Using similar methods as before.Possible rational roots: factors of 1.5 over factors of 2: ±1, ±1.5, ±0.5, ±0.75, etc.Let me try x=1:Q(1)=2 -5 +3 -1.5= -1.5.x=1.5:Q(1.5)=2*(3.375) -5*(2.25) +3*(1.5) -1.5=6.75 -11.25 +4.5 -1.5= (6.75 -11.25)= -4.5; (-4.5 +4.5)=0; 0 -1.5= -1.5.x=2:Q(2)=16 -20 +6 -1.5=0.5.So Q(2)=0.5>0.x=1.75:Q(1.75)=2*(5.359375) -5*(3.0625) +3*(1.75) -1.5=10.71875 -15.3125 +5.25 -1.5= (10.71875 -15.3125)= -4.59375; (-4.59375 +5.25)=0.65625; 0.65625 -1.5= -0.84375.x=1.875:Q(1.875)=2*(6.591796875) -5*(3.515625) +3*(1.875) -1.5=13.18359375 -17.578125 +5.625 -1.5= (13.18359375 -17.578125)= -4.39453125; (-4.39453125 +5.625)=1.23046875; 1.23046875 -1.5= -0.26953125.x=1.9:Q(1.9)=2*(6.859) -5*(3.61) +3*(1.9) -1.5=13.718 -18.05 +5.7 -1.5= (13.718 -18.05)= -4.332; (-4.332 +5.7)=1.368; 1.368 -1.5= -0.132.x=1.95:Q(1.95)=2*(7.408875) -5*(3.8025) +3*(1.95) -1.5=14.81775 -19.0125 +5.85 -1.5= (14.81775 -19.0125)= -4.19475; (-4.19475 +5.85)=1.65525; 1.65525 -1.5=0.15525>0.So, Q(1.95)=≈0.155>0.So, between x=1.9 and x=1.95, Q(x) crosses from negative to positive.Similarly, let's check x=1.925:Q(1.925)=2*(1.925)^3 -5*(1.925)^2 +3*(1.925) -1.5.1.925^2=3.705625,1.925^3=1.925*3.705625≈7.133.So,2*7.133≈14.266,-5*3.705625≈-18.528125,3*1.925≈5.775,-1.5.Total: 14.266 -18.528125≈-4.262125; -4.262125 +5.775≈1.512875; 1.512875 -1.5≈0.012875>0.So Q(1.925)=≈0.0129>0.x=1.92:Q(1.92)=2*(1.92)^3 -5*(1.92)^2 +3*(1.92) -1.5.1.92^2=3.6864,1.92^3=1.92*3.6864≈7.077888,So,2*7.077888≈14.155776,-5*3.6864≈-18.432,3*1.92≈5.76,-1.5.Total: 14.155776 -18.432≈-4.276224; -4.276224 +5.76≈1.483776; 1.483776 -1.5≈-0.016224.So Q(1.92)=≈-0.0162.So between x=1.92 and x=1.925, Q(x) crosses zero.Using linear approximation:At x=1.92, Q=-0.0162,At x=1.925, Q=0.0129.Change in x=0.005,Change in Q=0.0129 - (-0.0162)=0.0291.We need to find delta_x where Q=0.delta_x= (0 - (-0.0162))/0.0291 *0.005≈(0.0162/0.0291)*0.005≈0.5567*0.005≈0.00278.So approximate root at x≈1.92 +0.00278≈1.9228.So, Q(x)=0 at x≈1.9228.Therefore, Q(x)>0 when x>1.9228.But wait, let's check the behavior of Q(x).We know that as x approaches infinity, Q(x) approaches infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, Q(x) approaches negative infinity.We found that Q(1.9228)=0, and Q(x) increases beyond that.But wait, let's check the derivative of Q(x):Q’(x)=6x² -10x +3.Same as P’(x).So, critical points at x≈0.392 and x≈1.274.So, the function Q(x) has a local maximum at x≈0.392 and a local minimum at x≈1.274.Compute Q(0.392):x≈0.392,Q(x)=2*(0.392)^3 -5*(0.392)^2 +3*(0.392) -1.5.Compute:0.392^3≈0.0602,2*0.0602≈0.1204,0.392^2≈0.153664,-5*0.153664≈-0.7683,3*0.392≈1.176,-1.5.Total: 0.1204 -0.7683≈-0.6479; -0.6479 +1.176≈0.5281; 0.5281 -1.5≈-0.9719.So Q(0.392)=≈-0.9719.Similarly, Q(1.274)=?x≈1.274,Q(x)=2*(1.274)^3 -5*(1.274)^2 +3*(1.274) -1.5.1.274^2≈1.623,1.274^3≈2.066,So,2*2.066≈4.132,-5*1.623≈-8.115,3*1.274≈3.822,-1.5.Total: 4.132 -8.115≈-3.983; -3.983 +3.822≈-0.161; -0.161 -1.5≈-1.661.So Q(1.274)=≈-1.661.So, the function Q(x) has a local maximum at x≈0.392 of≈-0.9719, which is still negative, and a local minimum at x≈1.274 of≈-1.661, which is even more negative.Then, it increases after x≈1.274, crossing zero at x≈1.9228, and then continues to increase to infinity.Therefore, Q(x) >0 only when x>≈1.9228.So, the inequality P(x) >0.5 is satisfied when x>≈1.9228.But we need to express this as a range.Since x is the number of scripted elements, which is likely a non-negative real number, the range is x>≈1.9228.But let me check if there are any other intervals where Q(x) >0.Given that Q(x) approaches negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity, and only crosses zero once at x≈1.9228, and then increases to positive infinity, so Q(x) >0 only for x>≈1.9228.Therefore, the range of x where P(x) >0.5 is x>≈1.9228.But let me check at x=2, Q(2)=0.5>0, which matches.So, the range is x>≈1.9228.Therefore, a genuinely competitive match (P(x)>0.5) is possible when the number of scripted elements x is greater than approximately 1.9228.But since x is likely an integer in the context, but the model allows x to be continuous, so the range is x>1.9228.Therefore, the wrestler's victory probability exceeds 0.5 when the number of scripted elements is greater than approximately 1.9228.So, summarizing:1. The real root is approximately x≈1.83, meaning that when there are about 1.83 scripted elements, the probability of victory is zero.2. The probability exceeds 0.5 when x>≈1.9228, so a genuinely competitive match is possible when the number of scripted elements is greater than approximately 1.9228.But wait, in the first part, the root was≈1.83, and in the second part, the threshold is≈1.9228. So, the function crosses zero at≈1.83, and then crosses 0.5 at≈1.9228.Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because if the function is increasing after x≈1.274, then it goes from negative to positive, crossing zero at≈1.83, and then continues to increase, crossing 0.5 at≈1.9228.So, the function P(x) is negative before x≈1.83, zero at≈1.83, positive after that, and exceeds 0.5 at≈1.9228.Therefore, the range where P(x) >0.5 is x>≈1.9228.So, yes, a genuinely competitive match is possible when x>≈1.9228.But let me check if there are any other intervals where P(x) >0.5.Given that the function only crosses zero once and then increases to infinity, there are no other intervals. So, only x>≈1.9228 satisfies P(x) >0.5.Therefore, the answer to part 2 is x>≈1.9228.But to express it more precisely, perhaps find the exact root of Q(x)=0.But since it's a cubic, it's complicated. Alternatively, we can express it in terms of the root.Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that Q(x)=P(x)-0.5, so the roots of Q(x)=0 are the roots of P(x)=0.5.But since we already found that Q(x)=0 at x≈1.9228, which is the threshold.Therefore, the range is x>≈1.9228.So, in conclusion:1. The real root of P(x)=0 is approximately x≈1.83.2. The range of x where P(x) >0.5 is x>≈1.9228, so a genuinely competitive match is possible when x exceeds approximately 1.9228.But perhaps we can express the exact roots using the cubic formula, but that's quite involved.Alternatively, since the problem is about analysis, we can state the approximate values.So, final answers:1. The real root is approximately 1.83.2. The range is x>≈1.9228, so a genuinely competitive match is possible.But let me check if the function P(x) is increasing after x≈1.274, so after that point, it's increasing, so once it crosses zero at≈1.83, it continues to increase, crossing 0.5 at≈1.9228, and then continues to infinity.Therefore, the function is only above 0.5 for x>≈1.9228.So, yes, a genuinely competitive match is possible when x>≈1.9228.But wait, the question says \\"the probability of victory must be greater than 0.5 for a match to be considered genuinely competitive\\". So, the range is x>≈1.9228.But let me check if there's a maximum or if the function continues to increase. Since the leading term is 2x^3, as x increases, P(x) tends to infinity, so it's always increasing beyond a certain point.Therefore, the range is x>≈1.9228.So, to answer the questions:1. The real root is approximately x≈1.83.2. The range is x>≈1.9228, so a genuinely competitive match is possible when x exceeds approximately 1.9228.But perhaps the exact value is better expressed using the cubic formula, but that's too complex.Alternatively, we can write the exact roots using the cubic formula, but it's quite involved.Alternatively, perhaps factor the polynomial.Wait, for Q(x)=2x^3 -5x^2 +3x -1.5=0.Let me try to factor it.But since it's a cubic, and we know one real root is≈1.9228, perhaps factor out (x - r), where r≈1.9228.But without an exact value, it's difficult.Alternatively, perhaps use the depressed cubic.But given the time constraints, I think it's acceptable to provide the approximate values.Therefore, the answers are:1. The real root is approximately x≈1.83.2. The range of x is x>≈1.9228, so a genuinely competitive match is possible.But let me check if the function P(x) is indeed increasing after x≈1.274.Yes, because the derivative P’(x)=6x² -10x +3, which is positive for x>≈1.274, as the critical point at x≈1.274 is a local minimum.Therefore, after x≈1.274, the function is increasing.So, from x≈1.274 onwards, the function increases from≈-1.661 to infinity.Therefore, it crosses zero at≈1.83, and then crosses 0.5 at≈1.9228.Therefore, the range where P(x) >0.5 is x>≈1.9228.So, in conclusion, the wrestler's victory probability is zero when there are approximately 1.83 scripted elements, and the match is genuinely competitive (probability >0.5) when the number of scripted elements exceeds approximately 1.9228.But since the problem is about analysis, perhaps we can express the exact roots in terms of radicals, but that's complicated.Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that the real root of P(x)=0 is the same as the real root of Q(x)=P(x)-0.5=0 shifted by 0.5.But I think for the purposes of this problem, the approximate values are sufficient.Therefore, the final answers are:1. The real root is approximately x≈1.83.2. The range is x>≈1.9228, so a genuinely competitive match is possible.But to express it more precisely, perhaps use more decimal places.Alternatively, perhaps use fractions.Wait, 1.83 is approximately 1.83, which is≈11/6≈1.8333.Similarly, 1.9228 is≈1.9228≈1.9228≈1.9228.But perhaps express it as fractions.Alternatively, perhaps leave it as approximate decimals.Therefore, the answers are:1. The real root is approximately 1.83.2. The range is x>≈1.9228, so a genuinely competitive match is possible.But let me check if the function P(x) is indeed increasing after x≈1.274.Yes, because the derivative is positive beyond that point.Therefore, the function is increasing after x≈1.274, so once it crosses zero at≈1.83, it continues to increase, crossing 0.5 at≈1.9228.Therefore, the range where P(x) >0.5 is x>≈1.9228.So, the wrestler's victory probability exceeds 0.5 when the number of scripted elements is greater than approximately 1.9228.Therefore, a genuinely competitive match is possible when x>≈1.9228.But let me check if the function P(x) is indeed increasing after x≈1.274.Yes, because the derivative P’(x)=6x² -10x +3, which is positive for x>≈1.274.Therefore, the function is increasing beyond that point.Therefore, the range is x>≈1.9228.So, in conclusion:1. The real root is approximately x≈1.83.2. The range is x>≈1.9228, so a genuinely competitive match is possible.But to express the exact values, perhaps we can write the real root as the solution to 2x³ -5x² +3x -1=0, but that's not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps use the cubic formula.But given the time, I think the approximate values are sufficient.Therefore, the final answers are:1. The real root is approximately 1.83.2. The range is x>≈1.9228, so a genuinely competitive match is possible.But perhaps the problem expects exact values, but since it's a cubic, it's complicated.Alternatively, perhaps factor the polynomial.Wait, for P(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -1.Let me try to factor it.Assume it factors as (ax + b)(cx² + dx + e).But since it's a cubic, perhaps it's (x - r)(quadratic).But since we know the real root is≈1.83, perhaps write it as (x - r)(quadratic).But without an exact value, it's difficult.Alternatively, perhaps use synthetic division.But since the root is≈1.83, it's not a rational number.Therefore, I think the approximate values are acceptable.Therefore, the answers are:1. The real root is approximately 1.83.2. The range is x>≈1.9228, so a genuinely competitive match is possible.But to express it more precisely, perhaps use more decimal places.Alternatively, perhaps write the exact roots in terms of the cubic formula.But that's beyond the scope here.Therefore, I think the approximate values are sufficient."},{"question":"A traditionalist educator named Mr. Thompson is designing a curriculum module on quadratic equations. He wants to demonstrate the importance of understanding classic mathematical concepts by focusing on the roots of a quadratic equation and their historical significance in solving real-world problems.1. Mr. Thompson introduces the quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ) and provides the specific example ( 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 ). He challenges his students to solve the equation using the quadratic formula and to interpret the significance of the roots in terms of symmetry and balance, which he believes are essential classical values.2. To further illustrate his point, Mr. Thompson extends the lesson by asking his students to consider the inequality ( 2x^2 - 8x + 6 < 0 ). He asks them to find the range of values for ( x ) that satisfy this inequality, encouraging them to think about how inequalities can represent constraints and limitations in traditional problem-solving scenarios.","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation to solve: 3x² - 12x + 9 = 0. Hmm, I remember that quadratic equations are of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, and the quadratic formula is x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a). Let me try applying that here.First, let's identify a, b, and c. In this equation, a is 3, b is -12, and c is 9. Plugging these into the quadratic formula: x = (-(-12) ± √((-12)² - 4*3*9)) / (2*3). Simplifying that, x = (12 ± √(144 - 108)) / 6. The discriminant inside the square root is 144 - 108, which is 36. So, x = (12 ± 6) / 6.That gives two solutions: (12 + 6)/6 = 18/6 = 3, and (12 - 6)/6 = 6/6 = 1. So the roots are x = 1 and x = 3. Now, Mr. Thompson mentioned the significance of roots in terms of symmetry and balance. Quadratic equations graph as parabolas, right? The roots are where the parabola crosses the x-axis. The axis of symmetry is exactly halfway between the roots. So, halfway between 1 and 3 is 2. That means the vertex of the parabola is at x = 2. This shows the balance because the parabola is symmetric around this vertical line. It's like the roots mirror each other around this axis, which is a classical concept of symmetry in mathematics.Moving on to the inequality: 2x² - 8x + 6 < 0. I need to find the values of x where this quadratic expression is negative. First, maybe I should solve the corresponding equation 2x² - 8x + 6 = 0 to find the critical points. Let's use the quadratic formula again. Here, a = 2, b = -8, c = 6.Plugging into the formula: x = (-(-8) ± √((-8)² - 4*2*6)) / (2*2). That simplifies to x = (8 ± √(64 - 48)) / 4. The discriminant is 64 - 48 = 16. So, x = (8 ± 4)/4. That gives x = (8 + 4)/4 = 12/4 = 3, and x = (8 - 4)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So the roots are x = 1 and x = 3 again.Since the quadratic opens upwards (because the coefficient of x² is positive), the graph is a parabola opening upwards with roots at 1 and 3. The expression 2x² - 8x + 6 will be below zero (negative) between the roots. So, the solution to the inequality is the interval where x is between 1 and 3. Thinking about the historical significance, inequalities like this can model real-world constraints, such as resources or limitations. For example, in optimization problems, knowing where a function is positive or negative helps in determining feasible solutions. This ties back to classical problem-solving where understanding the behavior of functions is crucial.Wait, let me double-check the inequality. Since the parabola opens upwards, it will be below the x-axis between the roots. So yes, x between 1 and 3 satisfies the inequality. That makes sense because outside of these points, the quadratic is positive, and between them, it dips below the x-axis.I think that covers both the equation and the inequality. The roots are essential in both cases, showing the balance and symmetry in the equation, and the constraints in the inequality."},{"question":"As a competitive digital arts student with a popular art-themed YouTube channel, you notice that your subscriber count tends to grow faster when you upload videos more frequently. You currently have 10,000 subscribers, and you've observed that for every new artwork video you upload, the number of subscribers increases by about 5%.To maximize your subscriber base, you plan to upload a series of new videos over the next few weeks. Let ( x ) represent the number of new videos you plan to upload.1. Write a polynomial expression to represent the projected number of subscribers you will have after uploading ( x ) new videos.2. If you want your subscriber count to reach at least 15,000, solve the inequality to find the minimum number of new videos ( x ) you need to upload.","answer":"First, I need to understand how the subscriber count increases with each new video. Currently, there are 10,000 subscribers, and each new video increases the subscriber count by 5%.For each video uploaded, the number of subscribers is multiplied by 1.05. Therefore, after uploading ( x ) new videos, the projected number of subscribers can be represented by the expression ( 10,000 times (1.05)^x ).Next, to find the minimum number of new videos needed to reach at least 15,000 subscribers, I set up the inequality ( 10,000 times (1.05)^x geq 15,000 ).Dividing both sides by 10,000 simplifies the inequality to ( (1.05)^x geq 1.5 ).To solve for ( x ), I take the natural logarithm of both sides: ( ln((1.05)^x) geq ln(1.5) ).Using the logarithmic identity ( ln(a^b) = b ln(a) ), the inequality becomes ( x times ln(1.05) geq ln(1.5) ).Finally, solving for ( x ) gives ( x geq frac{ln(1.5)}{ln(1.05)} ). Calculating this value will provide the minimum number of new videos required."},{"question":"Alex, an understanding older sibling, wants to help their younger sibling, Jamie, who is dealing with anxiety about an upcoming math exam. Alex remembers that when they faced similar anxiety, they found that breaking problems into smaller, manageable parts helped them cope effectively. To support Jamie, Alex decides to create a practice problem involving quadratic equations, as this is a topic Jamie struggles with.1. Alex writes down a quadratic equation that models a scenario involving the path of a thrown ball: ( h(t) = -2t^2 + 8t + 3 ), where ( h(t) ) represents the height of the ball in meters, and ( t ) is the time in seconds since the ball was thrown. Help Jamie find the time when the ball reaches its maximum height.2. To further practice, Alex creates another related problem. They ask Jamie to solve a quadratic inequality that models a safe height for a drone flight. The inequality is given by ( -3x^2 + 12x + 9 geq 0 ), where ( x ) represents the time in seconds. Determine the interval of time during which the drone remains at or above a height of 9 meters.","answer":"Okay, so I need to help Jamie with these two quadratic problems. Let me start with the first one about the ball's path. The equation given is ( h(t) = -2t^2 + 8t + 3 ). I remember that quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola is the maximum point, which in this case is the maximum height of the ball.To find the time when the ball reaches its maximum height, I need to find the vertex of this quadratic function. I recall that the vertex form of a quadratic equation is ( h(t) = a(t - h)^2 + k ), where (h, k) is the vertex. But the equation is given in standard form, so maybe I should use the formula for the vertex in standard form. The formula is ( t = -frac{b}{2a} ), where a is the coefficient of ( t^2 ) and b is the coefficient of t.Looking at the equation ( h(t) = -2t^2 + 8t + 3 ), a is -2 and b is 8. Plugging these into the formula: ( t = -frac{8}{2*(-2)} ). Let me compute that step by step. The denominator is 2 times -2, which is -4. So it becomes ( t = -frac{8}{-4} ). Dividing 8 by 4 gives 2, and since both numerator and denominator are negative, the negatives cancel out, so t = 2. Wait, let me double-check that. If I plug t = 2 back into the equation, what's the height? ( h(2) = -2*(2)^2 + 8*2 + 3 ). That's -2*4 + 16 + 3, which is -8 + 16 + 3 = 11 meters. Hmm, that seems reasonable. So the maximum height is at t = 2 seconds. Alternatively, I could complete the square to convert the equation into vertex form. Let me try that as another method to confirm. Starting with ( h(t) = -2t^2 + 8t + 3 ). Factor out the coefficient of ( t^2 ) from the first two terms: ( h(t) = -2(t^2 - 4t) + 3 ). Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of -4, which is -2, square it to get 4. So add and subtract 4 inside the parentheses: ( h(t) = -2[(t^2 - 4t + 4 - 4)] + 3 ). That simplifies to ( h(t) = -2[(t - 2)^2 - 4] + 3 ). Distribute the -2: ( h(t) = -2(t - 2)^2 + 8 + 3 ). Combine constants: ( h(t) = -2(t - 2)^2 + 11 ). So the vertex is at (2, 11), confirming that the maximum height occurs at t = 2 seconds. Alright, that seems solid. Now onto the second problem, which is a quadratic inequality: ( -3x^2 + 12x + 9 geq 0 ). This models the safe height for a drone, and we need to find the interval of time when the drone is at or above 9 meters. First, let me write the inequality: ( -3x^2 + 12x + 9 geq 0 ). I think it might be easier to work with positive coefficients, so I can multiply both sides by -1. But wait, multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. So, multiplying by -1 gives: ( 3x^2 - 12x - 9 leq 0 ). Now, the inequality is ( 3x^2 - 12x - 9 leq 0 ). Let me try to solve this quadratic inequality. First, I can factor out a 3: ( 3(x^2 - 4x - 3) leq 0 ). Dividing both sides by 3 (which is positive, so inequality sign doesn't change): ( x^2 - 4x - 3 leq 0 ). Now, I need to find the roots of the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0 ). Using the quadratic formula: ( x = frac{4 pm sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4*1*(-3)}}{2*1} ). Calculating the discriminant: ( 16 + 12 = 28 ). So, ( x = frac{4 pm sqrt{28}}{2} ). Simplify sqrt(28) as 2*sqrt(7), so ( x = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{7}}{2} ). Dividing numerator and denominator by 2: ( x = 2 pm sqrt{7} ). So the roots are at ( x = 2 + sqrt{7} ) and ( x = 2 - sqrt{7} ). Since sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458, the roots are approximately 2 + 2.6458 = 4.6458 and 2 - 2.6458 = -0.6458. Since the quadratic ( x^2 - 4x - 3 ) opens upwards (coefficient of x^2 is positive), the graph is a parabola opening upwards, so it is below or equal to zero between its roots. Therefore, the solution to ( x^2 - 4x - 3 leq 0 ) is the interval [2 - sqrt(7), 2 + sqrt(7)]. But wait, the original inequality was ( -3x^2 + 12x + 9 geq 0 ). After multiplying by -1 and flipping the inequality, we had ( x^2 - 4x - 3 leq 0 ), whose solution is between the roots. So, the solution in terms of x is ( 2 - sqrt{7} leq x leq 2 + sqrt{7} ). However, since x represents time in seconds, it can't be negative. So, the lower bound is 2 - sqrt(7), which is approximately -0.6458, but since time can't be negative, the interval starts at x = 0. Therefore, the drone is at or above 9 meters from x = 0 up to x = 2 + sqrt(7) seconds. Wait, let me think again. The original inequality ( -3x^2 + 12x + 9 geq 0 ) was transformed into ( x^2 - 4x - 3 leq 0 ), which is true between the roots. But the roots are at approximately -0.6458 and 4.6458. So, in the context of time, x must be greater than or equal to 0. So, the interval where the inequality holds is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(7). But let me verify this by testing a point in each interval. The critical points are at x ≈ -0.6458 and x ≈ 4.6458. So, the intervals are:1. x < -0.64582. -0.6458 < x < 4.64583. x > 4.6458Since x can't be negative, we only consider x >= 0. So, let's test x = 1 (which is between 0 and 4.6458). Plugging into the original inequality: ( -3(1)^2 + 12(1) + 9 = -3 + 12 + 9 = 18, which is >= 0. So, it holds.Now, test x = 5 (greater than 4.6458): ( -3(25) + 12(5) + 9 = -75 + 60 + 9 = -6, which is < 0. So, the inequality doesn't hold there.Therefore, the solution is from x = 0 to x = 2 + sqrt(7). But wait, the original roots were at 2 - sqrt(7) and 2 + sqrt(7). Since 2 - sqrt(7) is negative, the interval where the inequality holds is from 0 to 2 + sqrt(7). But let me write it in exact terms. So, the interval is [0, 2 + sqrt(7)]. However, sometimes in these problems, they might consider the entire interval between the roots, but since time can't be negative, we adjust the lower bound to 0. Alternatively, if we consider the original inequality without transforming it, ( -3x^2 + 12x + 9 geq 0 ), we can factor it or find its roots. Let me try factoring. The equation is ( -3x^2 + 12x + 9 = 0 ). Multiply both sides by -1: ( 3x^2 - 12x - 9 = 0 ). Divide by 3: ( x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0 ), which is the same as before. So, the roots are still 2 ± sqrt(7). Since the coefficient of x^2 in the original inequality is negative (-3), the parabola opens downward. Therefore, the inequality ( -3x^2 + 12x + 9 geq 0 ) will hold between the roots. But since one root is negative, the interval where the inequality holds is from the negative root to the positive root. However, since time can't be negative, the relevant interval is from 0 to 2 + sqrt(7). So, putting it all together, the drone is at or above 9 meters from t = 0 seconds up until t = 2 + sqrt(7) seconds. Let me just recap:1. For the ball's maximum height, the time is 2 seconds.2. For the drone's safe height, the time interval is from 0 to 2 + sqrt(7) seconds.I think that's it. I should make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me quickly recheck the quadratic formula for the second problem:For ( x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0 ), discriminant is 16 + 12 = 28, so sqrt(28) is 2*sqrt(7). Therefore, roots are (4 ± 2sqrt(7))/2 = 2 ± sqrt(7). Correct.And for the first problem, vertex at t = -b/(2a) = -8/(2*(-2)) = 2. Correct.Alright, I feel confident about these answers.**Final Answer**1. The ball reaches its maximum height at boxed{2} seconds.2. The drone remains at or above 9 meters during the interval boxed{[0, 2 + sqrt{7}]} seconds."},{"question":"A music industry executive is analyzing the market for a new DRM (Digital Rights Management) solution.

Determine the number of subscriptions ( x ) that will maximize the revenue. What is the maximum revenue?2. Calculate the range of subscriptions ( x ) for which the revenue exceeds the cost.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a music industry executive analyzing a new DRM solution. They've given me two equations: one for revenue and one for cost. I need to figure out two things: first, the number of subscriptions that will maximize revenue and what that maximum revenue is. Second, I need to find the range of subscriptions where revenue exceeds cost. Hmm, let's take it step by step.Starting with the first part: determining the number of subscriptions that will maximize revenue. The revenue function is given by ( R(x) = -2x^2 + 40x - 100 ). I remember that for quadratic functions, the graph is a parabola. Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward, which means the vertex is the maximum point. So, the vertex will give me the maximum revenue.To find the vertex of a parabola given by ( ax^2 + bx + c ), the x-coordinate is at ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ). Let me apply that here. In this case, ( a = -2 ) and ( b = 40 ). Plugging those into the formula:( x = -frac{40}{2*(-2)} = -frac{40}{-4} = 10 ).So, the number of subscriptions that will maximize revenue is 10. Now, to find the maximum revenue, I need to plug this x-value back into the revenue function.Calculating ( R(10) ):( R(10) = -2*(10)^2 + 40*(10) - 100 )( R(10) = -2*100 + 400 - 100 )( R(10) = -200 + 400 - 100 )( R(10) = 100 ).So, the maximum revenue is 100,000 (since the revenue is in thousands of dollars). That seems straightforward.Moving on to the second part: calculating the range of subscriptions where revenue exceeds cost. The cost function is given by ( C(x) = 5x + 20 ). So, I need to find the values of x where ( R(x) > C(x) ).Let me set up the inequality:( -2x^2 + 40x - 100 > 5x + 20 ).To solve this, I'll bring all terms to one side:( -2x^2 + 40x - 100 - 5x - 20 > 0 )Simplify like terms:( -2x^2 + 35x - 120 > 0 ).Hmm, so I have a quadratic inequality here. Let me write it as:( -2x^2 + 35x - 120 > 0 ).It might be easier to work with a positive coefficient for ( x^2 ), so I'll multiply both sides by -1. But I have to remember that multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality sign.So, multiplying by -1:( 2x^2 - 35x + 120 < 0 ).Now, I need to solve ( 2x^2 - 35x + 120 < 0 ). To find where this quadratic is less than zero, I first need to find its roots.Using the quadratic formula:( x = frac{35 pm sqrt{(-35)^2 - 4*2*120}}{2*2} )Calculate discriminant:( D = 1225 - 960 = 265 ).So,( x = frac{35 pm sqrt{265}}{4} ).Let me approximate ( sqrt{265} ). Since ( 16^2 = 256 ) and ( 17^2 = 289 ), so ( sqrt{265} ) is approximately 16.28.Therefore,( x = frac{35 pm 16.28}{4} ).Calculating both roots:First root:( x = frac{35 + 16.28}{4} = frac{51.28}{4} ≈ 12.82 ).Second root:( x = frac{35 - 16.28}{4} = frac{18.72}{4} ≈ 4.68 ).So, the quadratic ( 2x^2 - 35x + 120 ) crosses the x-axis at approximately x = 4.68 and x = 12.82. Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive, the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the quadratic is below zero (negative) between its two roots.Thus, the inequality ( 2x^2 - 35x + 120 < 0 ) holds for ( 4.68 < x < 12.82 ).But since the number of subscriptions x must be an integer (I assume you can't sell a fraction of a subscription), we need to consider integer values within this interval.So, x must be greater than approximately 4.68 and less than approximately 12.82. Therefore, x can be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12.Wait, let me confirm that. If x must be greater than 4.68, the smallest integer x is 5. And less than 12.82, so the largest integer x is 12. So, x ranges from 5 to 12 inclusive.But just to be thorough, let me test x = 5 and x = 12 in the original inequality ( R(x) > C(x) ) to make sure.First, x = 5:Calculate R(5):( R(5) = -2*(5)^2 + 40*5 - 100 = -50 + 200 - 100 = 50 ).Calculate C(5):( C(5) = 5*5 + 20 = 25 + 20 = 45 ).So, 50 > 45, which is true.Now, x = 12:Calculate R(12):( R(12) = -2*(12)^2 + 40*12 - 100 = -2*144 + 480 - 100 = -288 + 480 - 100 = 92 ).Calculate C(12):( C(12) = 5*12 + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80 ).92 > 80, which is also true.What about x = 4? Let's check just below the lower bound.x = 4:R(4) = -2*16 + 160 - 100 = -32 + 160 - 100 = 28.C(4) = 20 + 20 = 40.28 < 40, so R(x) < C(x) at x=4, which is consistent with our interval.Similarly, x = 13:R(13) = -2*169 + 520 - 100 = -338 + 520 - 100 = 82.C(13) = 65 + 20 = 85.82 < 85, so R(x) < C(x) at x=13, which is also consistent.Therefore, the range of x where revenue exceeds cost is from 5 to 12 subscriptions, inclusive.Wait, but just to make sure, let's check x=12.82. Since x must be an integer, 12 is the last integer before 12.82. So, 12 is included, but 13 is not.Similarly, 4.68 is approximately 4.68, so the next integer is 5, which is included.So, summarizing:1. The number of subscriptions that maximize revenue is 10, with a maximum revenue of 100,000.2. The range of subscriptions where revenue exceeds cost is from 5 to 12 subscriptions.I think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.For part 1, vertex at x=10, R(10)=100. That seems right.For part 2, setting R(x) > C(x), which led to solving a quadratic inequality, resulting in x between approximately 4.68 and 12.82. Since x must be integer, x=5 to x=12.Yes, that all checks out.**Final Answer**1. The number of subscriptions that maximize revenue is boxed{10}, and the maximum revenue is boxed{100} thousand dollars.2. The range of subscriptions for which revenue exceeds cost is from boxed{5} to boxed{12} subscriptions."},{"question":"A nature photographer is planning a photo session at a landscape known for its beautiful sunrises and rich history of metal detecting. The photographer wants to capture the sunrise in multiple locations across the landscape, moving from one spot to another by following a specific path that forms a quadratic pattern.1.

The photographer wants to calculate the difference in elevation between this spot and the point of maximum elevation found earlier. Calculate this elevation difference.","answer":"To determine the maximum elevation along the path described by the quadratic equation ( y = -2x^2 + 8x + 3 ), I recognize that the equation is in the standard form of a quadratic function, ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ). Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is negative (( a = -2 )), the parabola opens downward, indicating that the vertex of the parabola represents the maximum point.The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ). Substituting the values from the equation, ( b = 8 ) and ( a = -2 ), I calculate ( x = -frac{8}{2(-2)} = 2 ) meters. This means the maximum elevation occurs at a horizontal distance of 2 meters from the starting point.To find the maximum elevation, I substitute ( x = 2 ) back into the original equation: ( y = -2(2)^2 + 8(2) + 3 = -8 + 16 + 3 = 11 ) meters. Therefore, the maximum elevation is 11 meters.Next, to calculate the elevation difference between the spot at 10 meters horizontally from the starting point and the point of maximum elevation, I first determine the elevation at ( x = 10 ) meters. Plugging this value into the equation gives ( y = -2(10)^2 + 8(10) + 3 = -200 + 80 + 3 = -117 ) meters.Finally, the elevation difference is the absolute difference between the maximum elevation and the elevation at 10 meters: ( |11 - (-117)| = |128| = 128 ) meters.

You determine that the security level of your encryption, ( S ), can be modeled by the polynomial equation:[ S(x) = 4x^3 - 9x^2 + 6x - 3 ]where ( x ) represents the complexity level of the encryption algorithm. To ensure optimal security without compromising system performance, you need to solve the following problems:1. Determine the critical points of the polynomial ( S(x) ) by solving for ( x ) when the derivative ( S'(x) ) is equal to zero.2. Given that the complexity level ( x ) must be greater than 1 to maintain system performance, find the range of ( x ) that satisfies the inequality ( S(x) > 0 ).","answer":"Alright, so I'm the CEO of a software company, and I need to optimize the encryption algorithm's efficiency. The security level is modeled by this polynomial equation: S(x) = 4x³ - 9x² + 6x - 3. My tasks are to find the critical points by solving where the derivative S'(x) is zero, and then determine the range of x greater than 1 where S(x) is positive. Hmm, okay, let's start with the first part.First, I remember that critical points occur where the derivative is zero or undefined. Since S(x) is a polynomial, its derivative will also be a polynomial, and polynomials are defined everywhere, so I just need to find where S'(x) equals zero.So, let's compute the derivative S'(x). The derivative of 4x³ is 12x², the derivative of -9x² is -18x, the derivative of 6x is 6, and the derivative of -3 is 0. So putting that all together, S'(x) = 12x² - 18x + 6.Now, I need to solve 12x² - 18x + 6 = 0. This is a quadratic equation, so I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 12, b = -18, and c = 6.Let me compute the discriminant first: b² - 4ac = (-18)² - 4*12*6. That's 324 - 288, which is 36. Okay, that's a perfect square, so the roots will be rational. So plugging into the quadratic formula: x = [18 ± sqrt(36)] / (2*12). sqrt(36) is 6, so x = [18 ± 6] / 24. Calculating the two roots: First root: (18 + 6)/24 = 24/24 = 1.Second root: (18 - 6)/24 = 12/24 = 0.5.So, the critical points are at x = 1 and x = 0.5. Hmm, interesting. So, these are the points where the slope of S(x) is zero, meaning they could be local maxima or minima.Now, moving on to the second part: finding the range of x > 1 where S(x) > 0. So, I need to solve the inequality 4x³ - 9x² + 6x - 3 > 0 for x > 1.First, maybe I should factor the polynomial S(x) to make it easier to analyze. Let me try factoring 4x³ - 9x² + 6x - 3.Looking for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term over factors of the leading coefficient. So, possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±1/2, ±3/2, ±1/4, ±3/4.Let me test x = 1: S(1) = 4 - 9 + 6 - 3 = -2. Not zero.x = 3: 4*27 - 9*9 + 6*3 - 3 = 108 - 81 + 18 - 3 = 42. Not zero.x = 1/2: 4*(1/8) - 9*(1/4) + 6*(1/2) - 3 = 0.5 - 2.25 + 3 - 3 = -1.75. Not zero.x = 3/2: 4*(27/8) - 9*(9/4) + 6*(3/2) - 3. Let's compute each term:4*(27/8) = 108/8 = 13.5-9*(9/4) = -81/4 = -20.256*(3/2) = 9-3 remains.Adding them up: 13.5 - 20.25 + 9 - 3 = (13.5 + 9) - (20.25 + 3) = 22.5 - 23.25 = -0.75. Not zero.x = 1/4: 4*(1/64) - 9*(1/16) + 6*(1/4) - 3. That's 0.0625 - 0.5625 + 1.5 - 3 = (0.0625 + 1.5) - (0.5625 + 3) = 1.5625 - 3.5625 = -2. Not zero.x = 3/4: 4*(27/64) - 9*(9/16) + 6*(3/4) - 3.Compute each term:4*(27/64) = 108/64 = 1.6875-9*(9/16) = -81/16 = -5.06256*(3/4) = 4.5-3 remains.Adding them up: 1.6875 - 5.0625 + 4.5 - 3 = (1.6875 + 4.5) - (5.0625 + 3) = 6.1875 - 8.0625 = -1.875. Not zero.Hmm, none of the rational roots seem to work. Maybe this polynomial doesn't factor nicely, or perhaps I made a mistake in testing. Wait, let me double-check x = 1: 4 - 9 + 6 - 3 is indeed -2. x = 3 gives 42, correct. Maybe I need to try another approach.Alternatively, since I couldn't factor it easily, perhaps I can analyze the behavior of S(x) for x > 1. Let's evaluate S(x) at some points greater than 1 to see where it becomes positive.We know that as x approaches infinity, the leading term 4x³ dominates, so S(x) tends to positive infinity. So, eventually, S(x) will be positive for large x. But when does it cross zero?We already saw that S(1) = -2, which is negative. Let's try x = 2: S(2) = 4*8 - 9*4 + 6*2 - 3 = 32 - 36 + 12 - 3 = 5. Positive. So, between x = 1 and x = 2, S(x) goes from -2 to 5, so it must cross zero somewhere in between.But wait, the critical points are at x = 0.5 and x = 1. So, x = 1 is a critical point. Let's see the behavior around x = 1.To the left of x = 1, say x = 0.5, S(0.5) = 4*(0.125) - 9*(0.25) + 6*(0.5) - 3 = 0.5 - 2.25 + 3 - 3 = -1.75. Negative.At x = 1, S(1) = -2.At x = 1.5, let's compute S(1.5): 4*(3.375) - 9*(2.25) + 6*(1.5) - 3.Compute each term:4*3.375 = 13.5-9*2.25 = -20.256*1.5 = 9-3.Adding up: 13.5 - 20.25 + 9 - 3 = (13.5 + 9) - (20.25 + 3) = 22.5 - 23.25 = -0.75. Still negative.At x = 1.75: 4*(5.359375) - 9*(3.0625) + 6*(1.75) - 3.Compute each term:4*5.359375 = 21.4375-9*3.0625 = -27.56256*1.75 = 10.5-3.Adding up: 21.4375 - 27.5625 + 10.5 - 3 = (21.4375 + 10.5) - (27.5625 + 3) = 31.9375 - 30.5625 = 1.375. Positive.So, between x = 1.5 and x = 1.75, S(x) goes from -0.75 to 1.375, so it crosses zero somewhere in there.Wait, but we also have a critical point at x = 1. So, let's analyze the intervals.The critical points divide the real line into intervals. Since we have critical points at x = 0.5 and x = 1, the intervals are (-∞, 0.5), (0.5, 1), and (1, ∞).We know S(x) is negative at x = 0.5 and x = 1, and positive at x = 2. So, let's test the intervals.In (-∞, 0.5): Let's pick x = 0. S(0) = -3. Negative.In (0.5, 1): Let's pick x = 0.75. S(0.75) = 4*(0.421875) - 9*(0.5625) + 6*(0.75) - 3.Compute each term:4*0.421875 = 1.6875-9*0.5625 = -5.06256*0.75 = 4.5-3.Adding up: 1.6875 - 5.0625 + 4.5 - 3 = (1.6875 + 4.5) - (5.0625 + 3) = 6.1875 - 8.0625 = -1.875. Negative.In (1, ∞): Let's pick x = 2, which we already saw is positive.So, S(x) is negative on (-∞, 0.5), negative on (0.5, 1), and positive on (1, ∞). Wait, but earlier when I tested x = 1.5, it was negative. Hmm, that contradicts.Wait, no, x = 1.5 is in (1, ∞), but S(1.5) was -0.75, which is negative. So, that suggests that S(x) is negative just after x = 1, but becomes positive at x = 2. So, there must be another root between x = 1 and x = 2.Wait, but earlier, when I tried to factor S(x), I couldn't find any rational roots. Maybe it has an irrational root between 1 and 2. Let's try to approximate it.Let me use the Intermediate Value Theorem. We know S(1) = -2, S(1.5) = -0.75, S(1.75) = 1.375. So, between x = 1.5 and x = 1.75, S(x) crosses zero.Let's narrow it down. Let's try x = 1.6:S(1.6) = 4*(4.096) - 9*(2.56) + 6*(1.6) - 3.Compute each term:4*4.096 = 16.384-9*2.56 = -23.046*1.6 = 9.6-3.Adding up: 16.384 - 23.04 + 9.6 - 3 = (16.384 + 9.6) - (23.04 + 3) = 25.984 - 26.04 = approximately -0.056. Almost zero, slightly negative.x = 1.6: S ≈ -0.056x = 1.61:S(1.61) = 4*(1.61)^3 - 9*(1.61)^2 + 6*(1.61) - 3.Compute 1.61³: 1.61*1.61 = 2.5921, then *1.61 ≈ 4.1732814*4.173281 ≈ 16.6931241.61² = 2.5921-9*2.5921 ≈ -23.32896*1.61 = 9.66-3.Adding up: 16.693124 - 23.3289 + 9.66 - 3 ≈ (16.693124 + 9.66) - (23.3289 + 3) ≈ 26.353124 - 26.3289 ≈ 0.0242. Positive.So, between x = 1.6 and x = 1.61, S(x) crosses zero. Let's approximate it as x ≈ 1.605.So, the real root is approximately x ≈ 1.605. Therefore, S(x) is positive for x > 1.605.But wait, earlier I thought S(x) was positive for x > 1, but actually, it's positive only after x ≈ 1.605. So, the range where S(x) > 0 for x > 1 is x > approximately 1.605.But since we need an exact answer, perhaps we can express it in terms of the root. Alternatively, maybe we can factor S(x) as (x - r)(quadratic), where r is the real root.Alternatively, perhaps we can use calculus to determine the intervals where S(x) is positive.Wait, since S(x) is a cubic polynomial with leading coefficient positive, it tends to -∞ as x approaches -∞ and +∞ as x approaches +∞. We have critical points at x = 0.5 and x = 1. Let's analyze the behavior around these points.At x = 0.5, which is a critical point, let's see if it's a local max or min. We can use the second derivative test.Compute S''(x): derivative of S'(x) = 12x² - 18x + 6 is 24x - 18.At x = 0.5: S''(0.5) = 24*(0.5) - 18 = 12 - 18 = -6 < 0. So, x = 0.5 is a local maximum.At x = 1: S''(1) = 24*1 - 18 = 6 > 0. So, x = 1 is a local minimum.So, the function has a local maximum at x = 0.5 and a local minimum at x = 1.We know S(0.5) ≈ -1.75, which is the local maximum, and S(1) = -2, which is the local minimum. Then, as x increases beyond 1, the function starts increasing again because the leading term dominates.So, after x = 1, the function increases from S(1) = -2, reaches a point where it crosses zero at x ≈ 1.605, and then continues to increase to infinity.Therefore, the range where S(x) > 0 for x > 1 is x > approximately 1.605.But since we need an exact answer, perhaps we can express it in terms of the root. Let me try to find the exact root.We have S(x) = 4x³ - 9x² + 6x - 3. Let me attempt to factor it.Since it's a cubic, maybe it can be factored as (ax + b)(cx² + dx + e). Let's try to factor it.Assume S(x) = (x - r)(4x² + px + q). Let's expand this:(x - r)(4x² + px + q) = 4x³ + (p - 4r)x² + (q - pr)x - qr.Set this equal to 4x³ - 9x² + 6x - 3.So, matching coefficients:4x³: 4 = 4, okay.x² term: p - 4r = -9.x term: q - pr = 6.constant term: -qr = -3.So, we have:1. p - 4r = -92. q - pr = 63. qr = 3We need to find integers p, q, r such that these equations hold.From equation 3: qr = 3. Possible integer pairs (q, r): (1,3), (3,1), (-1,-3), (-3,-1).Let's try q = 3, r = 1.Then from equation 1: p - 4*1 = -9 => p = -5.From equation 2: 3 - (-5)*1 = 3 + 5 = 8 ≠ 6. Doesn't work.Next, q = 1, r = 3.From equation 1: p - 4*3 = p -12 = -9 => p = 3.From equation 2: 1 - 3*3 = 1 -9 = -8 ≠ 6. Doesn't work.Next, q = -1, r = -3.From equation 1: p -4*(-3) = p +12 = -9 => p = -21.From equation 2: -1 - (-21)*(-3) = -1 -63 = -64 ≠ 6. Nope.Next, q = -3, r = -1.From equation 1: p -4*(-1) = p +4 = -9 => p = -13.From equation 2: -3 - (-13)*(-1) = -3 -13 = -16 ≠ 6. Nope.So, no integer solutions. Therefore, the polynomial doesn't factor nicely with integer roots. Hence, the real root is irrational, and we need to express it in terms of radicals or approximate it.Alternatively, since we can't factor it, we can use the fact that S(x) is positive for x > r, where r is the real root greater than 1.But since we need to express the range, perhaps we can write it as x > r, where r is the real root of S(x) = 0 in (1,2). Alternatively, we can express it using the cubic formula, but that might be too complicated.Alternatively, since we know that S(x) is increasing for x > 1 (since the derivative S'(x) = 12x² -18x +6. Let's check the sign of S'(x) for x >1.At x =1, S'(1) =12 -18 +6=0.For x >1, let's pick x=2: S'(2)=12*4 -18*2 +6=48-36+6=18>0. So, S'(x) is positive for x>1, meaning S(x) is increasing for x>1.Since S(x) is increasing for x>1, and S(1)=-2, and S(2)=5, it crosses zero exactly once between x=1 and x=2. Therefore, the range where S(x) >0 is x > r, where r is the real root in (1,2). Since we can't express r exactly without solving the cubic, we can write the range as x > r, where r is the solution to 4x³ -9x² +6x -3=0 in (1,2).Alternatively, if we need an approximate value, we can use methods like Newton-Raphson to find a better approximation.Let me try Newton-Raphson on S(x) =4x³ -9x² +6x -3.We know S(1.6) ≈ -0.056, S(1.61)≈0.0242.Let's take x₀=1.6.Compute S(1.6)=4*(1.6)^3 -9*(1.6)^2 +6*(1.6) -3.1.6³=4.096, 4*4.096=16.3841.6²=2.56, 9*2.56=23.046*1.6=9.6So, S(1.6)=16.384 -23.04 +9.6 -3= (16.384 +9.6) - (23.04 +3)=25.984 -26.04≈-0.056.S'(1.6)=12*(1.6)^2 -18*(1.6) +6.1.6²=2.56, 12*2.56=30.7218*1.6=28.8So, S'(1.6)=30.72 -28.8 +6=7.92.Now, Newton-Raphson update: x₁ = x₀ - S(x₀)/S'(x₀) =1.6 - (-0.056)/7.92≈1.6 +0.00707≈1.60707.Compute S(1.60707):First, compute x=1.60707.x³≈(1.60707)^3≈1.60707*1.60707=2.5827*1.60707≈4.153.4x³≈16.612.x²≈2.5827.-9x²≈-23.244.6x≈9.642.-3.Adding up:16.612 -23.244 +9.642 -3≈(16.612 +9.642) - (23.244 +3)=26.254 -26.244≈0.01.So, S(1.60707)≈0.01.Compute S'(1.60707)=12x² -18x +6.x²≈2.5827, 12*2.5827≈30.992.18x≈28.927.So, S'(x)=30.992 -28.927 +6≈8.065.Now, update x₂=1.60707 -0.01/8.065≈1.60707 -0.00124≈1.60583.Compute S(1.60583):x≈1.60583.x³≈(1.60583)^3≈1.60583*1.60583≈2.5787*1.60583≈4.143.4x³≈16.572.x²≈2.5787.-9x²≈-23.208.6x≈9.635.-3.Adding up:16.572 -23.208 +9.635 -3≈(16.572 +9.635) - (23.208 +3)=26.207 -26.208≈-0.001.So, S(1.60583)≈-0.001.Compute S'(1.60583)=12x² -18x +6≈12*2.5787 -18*1.60583 +6≈30.944 -28.904 +6≈8.04.Now, update x₃=1.60583 - (-0.001)/8.04≈1.60583 +0.000124≈1.60595.Compute S(1.60595):x≈1.60595.x³≈(1.60595)^3≈1.60595*1.60595≈2.5791*1.60595≈4.144.4x³≈16.576.x²≈2.5791.-9x²≈-23.212.6x≈9.6357.-3.Adding up:16.576 -23.212 +9.6357 -3≈(16.576 +9.6357) - (23.212 +3)=26.2117 -26.212≈-0.0003.Almost zero. So, the root is approximately x≈1.60595.Therefore, the range where S(x) >0 for x >1 is x > approximately 1.606.But since the problem asks for the range, perhaps we can express it as x > r, where r is the real root of S(x)=0 in (1,2). Alternatively, we can write it as x > (solution to 4x³ -9x² +6x -3=0).But since we need to present it as a range, and the root is approximately 1.606, we can write x > approximately 1.606.However, since the problem might expect an exact form, perhaps using the cubic formula, but that's quite involved. Alternatively, we can express it in terms of the critical points and the behavior of the function.Wait, but since we know that S(x) is increasing for x >1 (as S'(x) >0 for x >1), and S(1)=-2, and S(x) approaches infinity as x increases, the function crosses zero exactly once in (1,2). Therefore, the range where S(x) >0 is x > r, where r is the real root in (1,2).But since the problem asks for the range, perhaps we can write it as x > r, where r is the solution to 4x³ -9x² +6x -3=0 in (1,2). Alternatively, if we can express r in terms of radicals, but that's complicated.Alternatively, since the problem is for a CEO, maybe an approximate value is sufficient. So, x > approximately 1.606.But let me check if there's another way. Since S(x) is a cubic, and we know it has one real root and two complex roots (since it's a cubic with real coefficients, and we saw that it only crosses the x-axis once in (1,2)), so the real root is the only one we need to consider.Therefore, the range is x > r, where r≈1.606.But to express it exactly, we can write it as x > (1/2) + sqrt( (1/4) + (sqrt(2)/12) ) or something, but that's probably not necessary.Alternatively, since the problem is about optimization, maybe we can just state that the security level S(x) becomes positive when x exceeds approximately 1.606, so the range is x > 1.606.But let me double-check my calculations. Earlier, I found that S(1.60595)≈-0.0003, very close to zero, and S(1.606) would be slightly positive.So, rounding to three decimal places, r≈1.606.Therefore, the range is x >1.606.But since the problem might expect an exact form, perhaps we can write it in terms of the cubic root. Let me try to solve 4x³ -9x² +6x -3=0.Using the cubic formula is quite involved, but let's attempt it.The general cubic equation is ax³ + bx² + cx + d =0. Here, a=4, b=-9, c=6, d=-3.First, we can make a substitution x = y - b/(3a) to eliminate the quadratic term.Compute b/(3a)= (-9)/(12)= -3/4.So, let x = y + 3/4.Substitute into S(x):4(y + 3/4)³ -9(y + 3/4)² +6(y + 3/4) -3=0.Let me expand this:First, compute (y + 3/4)³:= y³ + 3*(y²)*(3/4) + 3*y*(3/4)² + (3/4)³= y³ + (9/4)y² + (27/16)y + 27/64.Multiply by 4:4*(y³ + (9/4)y² + (27/16)y + 27/64) =4y³ +9y² + (27/4)y + 27/16.Next, compute -9*(y + 3/4)²:(y + 3/4)² = y² + (3/2)y + 9/16.Multiply by -9: -9y² - (27/2)y - 81/16.Next, compute 6*(y + 3/4)=6y + 18/4=6y + 4.5=6y + 9/2.Finally, -3.Now, add all these together:4y³ +9y² + (27/4)y + 27/16-9y² - (27/2)y - 81/16+6y + 9/2-3Combine like terms:4y³+9y² -9y²=0+(27/4)y - (27/2)y +6y+27/16 -81/16 +9/2 -3Compute the y terms:27/4 -27/2 +6 = (27/4 -54/4 +24/4)= (27 -54 +24)/4= (-3)/4.Constant terms:27/16 -81/16 +9/2 -3= (-54/16) + (72/16) -48/16= (-54 +72 -48)/16= (-30)/16= -15/8.So, the transformed equation is:4y³ - (3/4)y -15/8=0.Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:32y³ -6y -15=0.So, 32y³ -6y -15=0.Now, this is a depressed cubic (no y² term). Let me write it as:y³ + py + q=0.Divide by 32: y³ - (6/32)y -15/32=0 => y³ - (3/16)y -15/32=0.So, p= -3/16, q= -15/32.Using the depressed cubic formula:y = cube_root(-q/2 + sqrt((q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3)) + cube_root(-q/2 - sqrt((q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3)).Compute discriminant D=(q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3.q/2= (-15/32)/2= -15/64.(q/2)^2= (225)/(4096).p/3= (-3/16)/3= -1/16.(p/3)^3= (-1/16)^3= -1/4096.So, D=225/4096 + (-1/4096)=224/4096=7/128.Since D>0, one real root and two complex roots.Compute cube roots:Let me compute A= cube_root(-q/2 + sqrt(D)).-q/2=15/64.sqrt(D)=sqrt(7/128)=sqrt(14)/ (8*sqrt(2))=sqrt(14)/(8*1.414)=sqrt(14)/11.312≈3.7417/11.312≈0.3307.But let's compute it exactly:sqrt(7/128)=sqrt(14)/ (8*sqrt(2))=sqrt(14)/(8*1.4142)=sqrt(14)/11.3136≈3.7417/11.3136≈0.3307.So, A= cube_root(15/64 +0.3307).Wait, 15/64≈0.2344.So, 0.2344 +0.3307≈0.5651.So, A≈cube_root(0.5651)≈0.826.Similarly, B= cube_root(-q/2 - sqrt(D))=cube_root(15/64 -0.3307)=cube_root(0.2344 -0.3307)=cube_root(-0.0963)≈-0.458.Therefore, y≈A + B≈0.826 -0.458≈0.368.So, y≈0.368.But let's compute it more accurately.Compute A= cube_root(15/64 + sqrt(7/128)).15/64≈0.234375.sqrt(7/128)=sqrt(14)/ (8*sqrt(2))=sqrt(14)/(8*1.4142)=sqrt(14)/11.3136≈3.7417/11.3136≈0.3307.So, 0.234375 +0.3307≈0.565075.cube_root(0.565075)= approximately 0.826.Similarly, B= cube_root(15/64 - sqrt(7/128))=cube_root(0.234375 -0.3307)=cube_root(-0.096325)= approximately -0.458.So, y≈0.826 -0.458≈0.368.Therefore, y≈0.368.But let's compute it more precisely.Alternatively, use the identity that y= cube_root( (15/64 + sqrt(7/128)) ) + cube_root( (15/64 - sqrt(7/128)) ).But this is getting too involved. Let's accept that y≈0.368.Therefore, x= y + 3/4≈0.368 +0.75≈1.118.Wait, that can't be right because earlier we found the root is around 1.606. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.Wait, no, the substitution was x= y + 3/4, so if y≈0.368, then x≈0.368 +0.75≈1.118, but that contradicts our earlier finding that the root is around 1.606.Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake in the substitution.Wait, let me check the substitution step again.We had x = y - b/(3a). Here, b=-9, a=4, so x= y - (-9)/(12)= y + 3/4. So, x= y + 0.75.But when we solved for y, we got y≈0.368, so x≈0.368 +0.75≈1.118, but earlier we found that S(1.118) is negative, which contradicts.Wait, no, actually, when we transformed the equation, we might have made a mistake in the expansion.Let me re-examine the expansion:S(x)=4x³ -9x² +6x -3.Substitute x= y + 3/4.Compute each term:4x³=4*(y + 3/4)^3=4*(y³ + (9/4)y² + (27/16)y + 27/64)=4y³ +9y² + (27/4)y + 27/16.-9x²= -9*(y + 3/4)^2= -9*(y² + (3/2)y + 9/16)= -9y² - (27/2)y -81/16.6x=6*(y + 3/4)=6y + 18/4=6y + 4.5=6y + 9/2.-3 remains.Now, add all together:4y³ +9y² + (27/4)y +27/16-9y² - (27/2)y -81/16+6y +9/2-3.Combine like terms:4y³+9y² -9y²=0+(27/4)y - (27/2)y +6y+27/16 -81/16 +9/2 -3.Compute y terms:27/4 -27/2 +6=27/4 -54/4 +24/4= (-3)/4.Constant terms:27/16 -81/16 +9/2 -3= (-54/16) + (72/16) -48/16= (-54 +72 -48)/16= (-30)/16= -15/8.So, the equation becomes:4y³ - (3/4)y -15/8=0.Multiply by 8:32y³ -6y -15=0.Yes, that's correct.So, the depressed cubic is y³ - (3/32)y -15/32=0.Wait, no, when we divided by 32, it's y³ - (3/32)y -15/32=0.So, p= -3/32, q= -15/32.Wait, earlier I thought p= -3/16, but that was a mistake. It's actually p= -3/32.So, let me correct that.So, p= -3/32, q= -15/32.Compute discriminant D=(q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3.q/2= (-15/32)/2= -15/64.(q/2)^2=225/4096.p/3= (-3/32)/3= -1/32.(p/3)^3= (-1/32)^3= -1/32768.So, D=225/4096 -1/32768= (225*8 -1)/32768= (1800 -1)/32768=1799/32768≈0.0548.So, sqrt(D)=sqrt(1799/32768)=sqrt(1799)/181.02≈42.42/181.02≈0.2343.Now, compute A= cube_root(-q/2 + sqrt(D))=cube_root(15/64 +0.2343).15/64≈0.2344.So, 0.2344 +0.2343≈0.4687.cube_root(0.4687)= approximately 0.776.Similarly, B= cube_root(-q/2 - sqrt(D))=cube_root(15/64 -0.2343)=cube_root(0.2344 -0.2343)=cube_root(0.0001)= approximately 0.0464.Wait, but that can't be right because 0.0001^(1/3)≈0.0464.But then y= A + B≈0.776 +0.0464≈0.8224.Therefore, x= y + 3/4≈0.8224 +0.75≈1.5724.Wait, that's closer to our earlier approximation of 1.606, but still not exact.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.Let me compute A and B more accurately.Compute A= cube_root(15/64 + sqrt(1799/32768)).15/64≈0.234375.sqrt(1799/32768)=sqrt(1799)/181.02≈42.42/181.02≈0.2343.So, A= cube_root(0.234375 +0.2343)=cube_root(0.468675).Compute cube_root(0.468675):We know that 0.7³=0.343, 0.75³=0.421875, 0.76³≈0.438976, 0.77³≈0.456533, 0.78³≈0.474552.So, 0.468675 is between 0.77³ and 0.78³.Compute 0.77³=0.456533.0.775³= (0.77 +0.005)^3=0.77³ +3*(0.77)^2*0.005 +3*(0.77)*(0.005)^2 + (0.005)^3≈0.456533 +3*(0.5929)*0.005 + negligible≈0.456533 +0.0088935≈0.4654265.Still less than 0.468675.0.777³≈?Compute 0.777³:0.777*0.777=0.603729.0.603729*0.777≈0.603729*0.7=0.4226103, 0.603729*0.077≈0.046443. Total≈0.4226103 +0.046443≈0.469053.So, 0.777³≈0.469053, which is slightly above 0.468675.So, A≈0.777 - a bit.Compute 0.777³=0.469053.Difference:0.469053 -0.468675=0.000378.So, to find x such that x³=0.468675, starting from 0.777, which gives 0.469053.We can use linear approximation.Let f(x)=x³.f'(x)=3x².At x=0.777, f'(x)=3*(0.777)^2≈3*0.603729≈1.811187.We need to find Δx such that f(0.777 +Δx)=0.468675.f(0.777) + f'(0.777)*Δx≈0.468675.0.469053 +1.811187*Δx≈0.468675.So, 1.811187*Δx≈0.468675 -0.469053≈-0.000378.Thus, Δx≈-0.000378 /1.811187≈-0.000208.So, A≈0.777 -0.000208≈0.776792.Similarly, compute B= cube_root(-q/2 - sqrt(D))=cube_root(15/64 - sqrt(1799/32768)).15/64≈0.234375.sqrt(1799/32768)=≈0.2343.So, 0.234375 -0.2343≈0.000075.So, B= cube_root(0.000075)≈0.0422.Thus, y≈A + B≈0.776792 +0.0422≈0.818992.Therefore, x= y + 3/4≈0.818992 +0.75≈1.568992≈1.569.Wait, but earlier approximation using Newton-Raphson gave x≈1.606, which is higher. So, there's a discrepancy here.Wait, perhaps the substitution was incorrect. Let me double-check.We had x= y + 3/4, and after substitution, we arrived at 32y³ -6y -15=0.But when we solved it, we got y≈0.818992, so x≈1.569, but earlier Newton-Raphson gave x≈1.606.This suggests that my substitution might have an error, or perhaps I made a mistake in the cubic formula.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the Newton-Raphson approximation, which gave x≈1.606.Given the time constraints, I think it's acceptable to use the approximate value of x≈1.606 for the root.Therefore, the range where S(x) >0 for x >1 is x > approximately 1.606.So, summarizing:1. Critical points at x=0.5 and x=1.2. The range where S(x) >0 for x >1 is x > approximately 1.606.But since the problem might expect an exact answer, perhaps we can express it in terms of the root.Alternatively, since the problem is about optimization, and the CEO needs to know the range, an approximate value is sufficient.Therefore, the final answers are:1. Critical points at x=0.5 and x=1.2. The range is x > approximately 1.606.But to express it more precisely, perhaps we can write it as x > (1 + sqrt(13))/4 or something, but that might not be accurate.Wait, let me check if the cubic can be factored as (x - a)(quadratic). Alternatively, perhaps using the rational root theorem again, but we saw that there are no rational roots.Alternatively, perhaps we can write the real root in terms of the cubic formula, but it's quite involved.Given the time, I think it's best to present the approximate value."},{"question":"Inspired by stories of discipline from your grandfather, you decide to incorporate a lesson about balance and perseverance into your preparation for college applications. Your grandfather often talks about how his consistent effort was like balancing two sides of a scale, where hard work and patience always equaled success.1. Imagine you have a scale that must be perfectly balanced with weights on both sides. On one side of the scale, you have three weights represented by the polynomial expression ( 2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5 ). On the other side, you have two weights represented by the polynomial expression ( x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 ). Find the value of ( x ) that balances the scale.2. Your grandfather also shares a story about how he always aimed to exceed expectations, much like solving an inequality where achieving more than the minimum was crucial. Suppose the balanced state of the scale from the first sub-problem represents the minimum effort required for success. Write and solve an inequality that represents achieving a state where your effort is strictly greater than the balanced state.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to balance a scale with two sides, each having different polynomial expressions. On one side, there are three weights represented by the polynomial (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5), and on the other side, there are two weights represented by (x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1). I need to find the value of (x) that balances the scale, which means setting these two polynomials equal to each other and solving for (x).Alright, let me write that equation down:(2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1)Hmm, okay. To solve for (x), I should bring all the terms to one side so that I can have a single polynomial equation equal to zero. Let me subtract the right side from both sides to do that.Subtracting (x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1) from both sides:(2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5 - (x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0)Now, distribute the negative sign to each term inside the parentheses:(2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5 - x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0)Next, combine like terms. Let's see:- For (x^3) terms: (2x^3 - x^3 = x^3)- For (x^2) terms: (-3x^2 - 4x^2 = -7x^2)- For (x) terms: (x + 2x = 3x)- For constants: (-5 - 1 = -6)Putting it all together, the equation becomes:(x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0)So now, I have a cubic equation: (x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0). I need to solve this for (x). Cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor this or use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible roots.The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction (frac{p}{q}), is such that (p) is a factor of the constant term and (q) is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is (-6) and the leading coefficient is (1). So possible rational roots are (pm1, pm2, pm3, pm6).Let me test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation.First, test (x = 1):(1^3 - 7(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = 1 - 7 + 3 - 6 = -9). Not zero.Next, test (x = 2):(2^3 - 7(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = 8 - 28 + 6 - 6 = -20). Not zero.Next, test (x = 3):(3^3 - 7(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = 27 - 63 + 9 - 6 = -33). Not zero.Next, test (x = 6):(6^3 - 7(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = 216 - 252 + 18 - 6 = -24). Not zero.Hmm, none of the positive integers worked. Let me try the negative ones.Test (x = -1):((-1)^3 - 7(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = -1 - 7 - 3 - 6 = -17). Not zero.Test (x = -2):((-2)^3 - 7(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = -8 - 28 - 6 - 6 = -48). Not zero.Hmm, none of the rational roots seem to work. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations or perhaps the equation doesn't factor nicely. Let me double-check my earlier steps.Starting from the original equation:(2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1)Subtracting the right side:(2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5 - x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0)Combine like terms:(x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0)Yes, that seems correct. So, since none of the rational roots work, maybe I need to use another method. Perhaps synthetic division or factoring by grouping? Let me try factoring by grouping.Looking at (x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x - 6), let me group the first two terms and the last two terms:((x^3 - 7x^2) + (3x - 6))Factor out (x^2) from the first group and 3 from the second group:(x^2(x - 7) + 3(x - 2))Hmm, that doesn't seem to help because the binomials are different: (x - 7) and (x - 2). Maybe another grouping?Alternatively, maybe I can try to factor it as a cubic. Let me see if I can write it as ((x - a)(x^2 + bx + c)). Expanding this would give (x^3 + (b - a)x^2 + (c - ab)x - ac). Comparing coefficients with (x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x - 6):- Coefficient of (x^3): 1 = 1, okay.- Coefficient of (x^2): (b - a = -7)- Coefficient of (x): (c - ab = 3)- Constant term: (-ac = -6) => (ac = 6)So, from the constant term, (ac = 6). Possible integer pairs for (a) and (c) are (1,6), (2,3), (-1,-6), (-2,-3). Let's try these.First, let me assume (a) is positive.Case 1: (a = 1), then (c = 6). Then from (b - a = -7), (b = -7 + a = -7 + 1 = -6). Then check (c - ab = 6 - (1)(-6) = 6 + 6 = 12). But we need 3, so this doesn't work.Case 2: (a = 2), then (c = 3). Then (b = -7 + 2 = -5). Then (c - ab = 3 - (2)(-5) = 3 + 10 = 13). Not 3.Case 3: (a = 3), then (c = 2). Then (b = -7 + 3 = -4). Then (c - ab = 2 - (3)(-4) = 2 + 12 = 14). Not 3.Case 4: (a = 6), then (c = 1). Then (b = -7 + 6 = -1). Then (c - ab = 1 - (6)(-1) = 1 + 6 = 7). Not 3.Now, trying negative (a):Case 5: (a = -1), then (c = -6). Then (b = -7 + (-1) = -8). Then (c - ab = -6 - (-1)(-8) = -6 - 8 = -14). Not 3.Case 6: (a = -2), then (c = -3). Then (b = -7 + (-2) = -9). Then (c - ab = -3 - (-2)(-9) = -3 - 18 = -21). Not 3.Case 7: (a = -3), then (c = -2). Then (b = -7 + (-3) = -10). Then (c - ab = -2 - (-3)(-10) = -2 - 30 = -32). Not 3.Case 8: (a = -6), then (c = -1). Then (b = -7 + (-6) = -13). Then (c - ab = -1 - (-6)(-13) = -1 - 78 = -79). Not 3.Hmm, none of these worked. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Perhaps using the cubic formula? But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check.Original problem: one side has three weights (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5), the other side has two weights (x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1). So, to balance, they must be equal.Yes, so equation is correct: (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1). Then moving all terms to left: (x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0). Correct.Since factoring isn't working, maybe I can use the method of depressed cubic or try to find real roots numerically.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the root.Let me consider the function (f(x) = x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x - 6). I need to find (x) such that (f(x) = 0).First, let's see the behavior of (f(x)):As (x) approaches positive infinity, (f(x)) approaches positive infinity.As (x) approaches negative infinity, (f(x)) approaches negative infinity.Let me compute (f(0)): (0 - 0 + 0 - 6 = -6).(f(1)): (1 - 7 + 3 - 6 = -9).(f(2)): (8 - 28 + 6 - 6 = -20).(f(3)): (27 - 63 + 9 - 6 = -33).(f(4)): (64 - 112 + 12 - 6 = -42).(f(5)): (125 - 175 + 15 - 6 = -41).(f(6)): (216 - 252 + 18 - 6 = -24).(f(7)): (343 - 343 + 21 - 6 = 15).So, between (x=6) and (x=7), (f(x)) goes from -24 to 15, so there's a root between 6 and 7.Similarly, let's check (f(5)): -41, (f(6)): -24, so it's increasing but still negative.Wait, but (f(7)) is positive, so the root is between 6 and 7.Let me try (x=6.5):(6.5^3 = 274.625)(7x^2 = 7*(42.25) = 295.75)(3x = 19.5)So, (f(6.5) = 274.625 - 295.75 + 19.5 - 6 = (274.625 - 295.75) + (19.5 - 6) = (-21.125) + (13.5) = -7.625). Still negative.Next, (x=6.75):(6.75^3 = 6.75*6.75*6.75). Let's compute 6.75^2 first: 45.5625. Then 45.5625*6.75.Compute 45.5625*6 = 273.375, 45.5625*0.75 = 34.171875. Total: 273.375 + 34.171875 = 307.546875.(7x^2 = 7*(45.5625) = 318.9375)(3x = 20.25)So, (f(6.75) = 307.546875 - 318.9375 + 20.25 - 6).Compute step by step:307.546875 - 318.9375 = -11.390625-11.390625 + 20.25 = 8.8593758.859375 - 6 = 2.859375So, (f(6.75) ≈ 2.86). Positive.So, the root is between 6.5 and 6.75.Let me try (x=6.6):(6.6^3 = 6.6*6.6*6.6 = 43.56*6.6 = let's compute 43.56*6 = 261.36, 43.56*0.6=26.136, total=261.36+26.136=287.496)(7x^2 = 7*(43.56) = 304.92)(3x = 19.8)So, (f(6.6) = 287.496 - 304.92 + 19.8 - 6)Compute:287.496 - 304.92 = -17.424-17.424 + 19.8 = 2.3762.376 - 6 = -3.624So, (f(6.6) ≈ -3.624). Negative.So, between 6.6 and 6.75, the function goes from -3.624 to +2.859.Let me try (x=6.7):(6.7^3 = 6.7*6.7*6.7). Compute 6.7^2=44.89, then 44.89*6.7.44.89*6=269.34, 44.89*0.7=31.423, total=269.34+31.423=300.763(7x^2 = 7*(44.89)=314.23)(3x=20.1)So, (f(6.7)=300.763 - 314.23 + 20.1 -6)Compute:300.763 - 314.23 = -13.467-13.467 + 20.1 = 6.6336.633 -6=0.633So, (f(6.7)≈0.633). Positive.So, between 6.6 and 6.7, the function crosses zero.At (x=6.6), (f(x)=-3.624)At (x=6.7), (f(x)=0.633)Let me use linear approximation.The change in x is 0.1, and the change in f(x) is 0.633 - (-3.624)=4.257.We need to find delta_x such that f(x) increases by 3.624 to reach zero.So, delta_x = (3.624 / 4.257)*0.1 ≈ (0.851)*0.1≈0.0851So, approximate root is 6.6 + 0.0851≈6.6851Let me test (x=6.6851):Compute (f(6.6851)):First, compute (x^3):6.6851^3. Let me compute 6.6851^2 first.6.6851*6.6851:Compute 6*6=36, 6*0.6851=4.1106, 0.6851*6=4.1106, 0.6851*0.6851≈0.469.So, 36 + 4.1106 + 4.1106 + 0.469≈44.6902.Wait, that's an approximation. Actually, 6.6851^2 is approximately 44.6902.Then, 44.6902*6.6851≈?Compute 44.6902*6=268.141244.6902*0.6851≈44.6902*0.6=26.81412, 44.6902*0.0851≈3.802.So total≈26.81412 +3.802≈30.61612So, total x^3≈268.1412 +30.61612≈298.7573Now, (7x^2=7*44.6902≈312.8314)(3x≈3*6.6851≈20.0553)So, (f(x)=298.7573 -312.8314 +20.0553 -6)Compute:298.7573 -312.8314≈-14.0741-14.0741 +20.0553≈5.98125.9812 -6≈-0.0188So, (f(6.6851)≈-0.0188). Close to zero, but still slightly negative.Let me try (x=6.6851 + 0.001=6.6861)Compute (f(6.6861)):First, compute (x^3). Since 6.6851^3≈298.7573, let's compute the difference.The derivative (f'(x)=3x^2 -14x +3). At x=6.6851, f'(x)=3*(6.6851)^2 -14*(6.6851)+3.Compute 6.6851^2≈44.6902So, 3*44.6902≈134.070614*6.6851≈93.5914So, f'(x)=134.0706 -93.5914 +3≈43.4792So, using linear approximation, delta_x= (0 - (-0.0188))/43.4792≈0.0188/43.4792≈0.000432So, next approximation: x=6.6851 +0.000432≈6.6855Compute (f(6.6855)):Using the derivative, f(x + delta_x)≈f(x) + f'(x)*delta_xf(6.6851)= -0.0188delta_x=0.0004f'(6.6851)=43.4792So, f(6.6855)≈-0.0188 +43.4792*0.0004≈-0.0188 +0.01739≈-0.0014Still slightly negative.Next, delta_x= (0 - (-0.0014))/43.4792≈0.0014/43.4792≈0.000032So, x≈6.6855 +0.000032≈6.685532Compute f(6.685532):Again, using linear approx:f(x + delta_x)=f(x) + f'(x)*delta_x≈-0.0014 +43.4792*0.000032≈-0.0014 +0.00139≈-0.00001Almost zero. So, the root is approximately 6.685532.To get a better approximation, let's do one more iteration.delta_x= (0 - (-0.00001))/43.4792≈0.00001/43.4792≈0.00000023So, x≈6.685532 +0.00000023≈6.68553223So, the root is approximately 6.6855.Thus, the value of (x) that balances the scale is approximately 6.6855.But since the problem might expect an exact value, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in assuming it's a cubic. Alternatively, maybe I can factor it differently.Wait, another thought: perhaps I can factor the cubic as ((x - a)(quadratic)). Let me try to factor it again.Given (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6), perhaps I can try to factor it as ((x - 3)(x^2 -4x +2)). Let me check:Multiply out ((x - 3)(x^2 -4x +2)):(x*(x^2 -4x +2) -3*(x^2 -4x +2) = x^3 -4x^2 +2x -3x^2 +12x -6)Combine like terms:(x^3 -7x^2 +14x -6)Wait, that's not the same as our cubic, which is (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6). The x term is different: 14x vs 3x. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe ((x - 2)(x^2 -5x +3)):Multiply out:(x*(x^2 -5x +3) -2*(x^2 -5x +3) = x^3 -5x^2 +3x -2x^2 +10x -6)Combine like terms:(x^3 -7x^2 +13x -6)Again, the x term is 13x vs 3x. Not matching.Wait, perhaps ((x - 1)(x^2 -6x +6)):Multiply out:(x*(x^2 -6x +6) -1*(x^2 -6x +6) = x^3 -6x^2 +6x -x^2 +6x -6)Combine like terms:(x^3 -7x^2 +12x -6)Still, x term is 12x vs 3x.Hmm, seems like none of these factorings work. Maybe the cubic is irreducible and doesn't factor nicely, so the only real root is approximately 6.6855.But let me check if I can write it in terms of radicals. The general solution for a cubic is complicated, but maybe this one can be expressed in a simpler form.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the depressed cubic formula.Given the cubic equation (x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0), we can make a substitution (x = y - p/3) to eliminate the (y^2) term.In our case, the equation is (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6 = 0). So, (p = -7), (q = 3), (r = -6).Let me make the substitution (x = y + 7/3). Then, we can express the equation in terms of (y).Compute (x = y + 7/3).Compute (x^3 = (y + 7/3)^3 = y^3 + 3*(7/3)*y^2 + 3*(7/3)^2*y + (7/3)^3)= (y^3 + 7y^2 + (49/3)y + 343/27)Similarly, (x^2 = (y + 7/3)^2 = y^2 + (14/3)y + 49/9)Now, substitute into the original equation:(x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6 = 0)= ([y^3 + 7y^2 + (49/3)y + 343/27] -7*[y^2 + (14/3)y + 49/9] +3*[y + 7/3] -6 = 0)Now, expand each term:First term: (y^3 + 7y^2 + (49/3)y + 343/27)Second term: (-7y^2 - (98/3)y - 343/9)Third term: (3y + 7)Fourth term: (-6)Now, combine all terms:(y^3 + 7y^2 + (49/3)y + 343/27 -7y^2 - (98/3)y - 343/9 +3y +7 -6 = 0)Combine like terms:- (y^3): (y^3)- (y^2): (7y^2 -7y^2 = 0)- (y): ((49/3)y - (98/3)y +3y = (49/3 -98/3 +9/3)y = (-40/3)y)- Constants: (343/27 -343/9 +7 -6)Compute constants:Convert all to 27 denominator:343/27 - (343/9)*(3/3)= -1029/27 + (7 -6)*(27/27)=1/27So, 343/27 -1029/27 +1/27 = (343 -1029 +1)/27 = (-685)/27So, the equation becomes:(y^3 - (40/3)y - 685/27 = 0)Multiply both sides by 27 to eliminate denominators:(27y^3 - 360y - 685 = 0)So, the depressed cubic is (y^3 + py + q = 0), where (p = -360/27 = -40/3) and (q = -685/27).Wait, actually, after multiplying by 27:27y^3 - 360y -685 =0So, it's (y^3 - (40/3)y - 685/27 = 0)Now, using the depressed cubic formula:The general solution for (y^3 + py + q = 0) is:(y = sqrt[3]{-q/2 + sqrt{(q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3}} + sqrt[3]{-q/2 - sqrt{(q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3}})In our case, (p = -40/3), (q = -685/27).Compute (q/2 = (-685/27)/2 = -685/54)Compute ((q/2)^2 = (685/54)^2 = (685)^2/(54)^2 = 469,225/2,916 ≈161.0Compute ((p/3)^3 = (-40/3 /3)^3 = (-40/9)^3 = -64,000/729 ≈-87.791So, discriminant (D = (q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3 = 161.0 -87.791 ≈73.209)Since D is positive, there is one real root and two complex roots.Compute (u = sqrt[3]{-q/2 + sqrt{D}} = sqrt[3]{685/54 + sqrt{73.209}})Compute (sqrt{73.209} ≈8.556)So, (u = sqrt[3]{685/54 +8.556})Compute 685/54 ≈12.685So, 12.685 +8.556≈21.241Thus, (u = sqrt[3]{21.241} ≈2.77)Similarly, (v = sqrt[3]{-q/2 - sqrt{D}} = sqrt[3]{685/54 -8.556})Compute 685/54≈12.685 -8.556≈4.129Thus, (v = sqrt[3]{4.129}≈1.607)So, the real solution is (y = u + v ≈2.77 +1.607≈4.377)But wait, let me check the calculations more accurately.First, compute (q/2 = -685/54 ≈-12.685)Compute ((q/2)^2 = (12.685)^2 ≈160.93)Compute ((p/3)^3 = (-40/9)^3 = (-4.444)^3 ≈-87.791)So, discriminant D=160.93 -87.791≈73.139Compute (sqrt{D}≈8.553)Thus, (u = sqrt[3]{-q/2 + sqrt{D}} = sqrt[3]{12.685 +8.553} = sqrt[3]{21.238}≈2.77)Similarly, (v = sqrt[3]{-q/2 - sqrt{D}} = sqrt[3]{12.685 -8.553} = sqrt[3]{4.132}≈1.607)Thus, (y = u + v ≈2.77 +1.607≈4.377)But wait, in the depressed cubic, the solution is (y = u + v), so (y≈4.377)But remember, (x = y + 7/3 ≈4.377 +2.333≈6.710)Wait, earlier approximation was around 6.6855, which is close to 6.710. The slight discrepancy is due to the approximations in cube roots.So, the exact solution is (x = y + 7/3), where (y = sqrt[3]{-q/2 + sqrt{D}} + sqrt[3]{-q/2 - sqrt{D}})Plugging in the exact values:(q = -685/27), so (-q/2 = 685/(27*2)=685/54)(D = (q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3 = (685/54)^2 + (-40/9)^3)But this is getting too complicated. So, the exact solution is:(x = sqrt[3]{frac{685}{54} + sqrt{left(frac{685}{54}right)^2 + left(frac{-40}{9}right)^3}} + sqrt[3]{frac{685}{54} - sqrt{left(frac{685}{54}right)^2 + left(frac{-40}{9}right)^3}} + frac{7}{3})But this is messy. Alternatively, we can write it as:(x = sqrt[3]{frac{685}{54} + sqrt{left(frac{685}{54}right)^2 - left(frac{40}{9}right)^3}} + sqrt[3]{frac{685}{54} - sqrt{left(frac{685}{54}right)^2 - left(frac{40}{9}right)^3}} + frac{7}{3})But this is still complicated. So, perhaps the answer is best left as an approximate decimal, around 6.6855.But let me check if there are any other real roots. Since it's a cubic, there should be three roots, one real and two complex conjugates. So, the only real solution is approximately 6.6855.Therefore, the value of (x) that balances the scale is approximately 6.6855.For the second part, the grandfather's story is about exceeding expectations, so the balanced state is the minimum effort, and we need to write an inequality where effort is strictly greater than this balanced state.So, the balanced state is (x ≈6.6855). Therefore, the inequality would be (x > 6.6855).But since we might want an exact expression, perhaps we can write it in terms of the cubic equation. The balanced state is the real root of (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6=0). Let's denote this root as (x_0). Then, the inequality is (x > x_0).Alternatively, if we want to express it in terms of the original equation, since the balanced state is when (2x^3 -3x^2 +x -5 =x^3 +4x^2 -2x +1), which simplifies to (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6=0), the inequality would be (2x^3 -3x^2 +x -5 >x^3 +4x^2 -2x +1), which simplifies to (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6 >0).So, the inequality is (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6 >0).But since we know that the cubic has one real root at (x≈6.6855), and since the leading coefficient is positive, the cubic will be positive when (x > x_0), where (x_0≈6.6855).Therefore, the inequality representing effort strictly greater than the balanced state is (x > sqrt[3]{frac{685}{54} + sqrt{left(frac{685}{54}right)^2 - left(frac{40}{9}right)^3}} + sqrt[3]{frac{685}{54} - sqrt{left(frac{685}{54}right)^2 - left(frac{40}{9}right)^3}} + frac{7}{3}), but more simply, (x > x_0), where (x_0) is the real root of (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6=0).Alternatively, since the cubic is positive for (x > x_0), the inequality is (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6 >0), which is equivalent to (x > x_0).So, summarizing:1. The value of (x) that balances the scale is the real root of (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6=0), approximately 6.6855.2. The inequality representing effort strictly greater than the balanced state is (x > x_0), where (x_0≈6.6855), or equivalently, (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6 >0).But since the problem might expect an exact form, perhaps expressing the inequality in terms of the original polynomials:(2x^3 -3x^2 +x -5 >x^3 +4x^2 -2x +1)Which simplifies to (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6 >0), as before.So, the final answers are:1. The value of (x) is the real root of the cubic equation, approximately 6.6855.2. The inequality is (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6 >0), which is satisfied for (x > x_0), where (x_0≈6.6855).But since the problem might expect an exact answer, perhaps we can write the inequality as (x > sqrt[3]{frac{685}{54} + sqrt{left(frac{685}{54}right)^2 - left(frac{40}{9}right)^3}} + sqrt[3]{frac{685}{54} - sqrt{left(frac{685}{54}right)^2 - left(frac{40}{9}right)^3}} + frac{7}{3}), but that's quite complicated.Alternatively, since the cubic is positive for (x > x_0), we can write the inequality as (x > x_0), where (x_0) is the real root of (x^3 -7x^2 +3x -6=0).But perhaps the problem expects a simpler form, so I'll stick with the approximate value for the first part and the inequality in terms of the cubic for the second part."},{"question":"A fitness blogger is creating a new strength training program for outdoor enthusiasts, including rock climbers and hikers. The program involves exercises focusing on developing the strength needed for ascending steep trails and climbing routes. To determine the appropriate weight for strength exercises, the blogger uses the following polynomial function to model the strength-to-weight ratio required for a given elevation gain:( S(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 7 )where ( S(x) ) represents the strength-to-weight ratio, and ( x ) is the weight (in kilograms) a participant can lift.1. For a specific training session, the blogger aims for a strength-to-weight ratio of exactly 15. What weight ( x ) should a participant be able to lift? Solve the equation ( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 7 = 15 ).2. The blogger also wants to ensure that the participants maintain a minimum strength-to-weight ratio of 10 for safety. Determine the range of weights ( x ) that satisfy the inequality ( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 7 geq 10 ).","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a fitness blogger creating a strength training program. The main focus is on outdoor activities like rock climbing and hiking, which makes sense because those require a lot of upper body strength and endurance. The blogger is using this polynomial function S(x) = 2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 7 to model the strength-to-weight ratio needed for a given elevation gain. The first part of the problem asks me to find the weight x that a participant should be able to lift to achieve a strength-to-weight ratio of exactly 15. So, I need to solve the equation 2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 7 = 15. Okay, let's start by setting up the equation. If S(x) is 15, then:2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 7 = 15To solve for x, I should bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. So, subtract 15 from both sides:2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 7 - 15 = 0Simplify that:2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 22 = 0So now, I have a cubic equation: 2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 22 = 0. Hmm, solving cubic equations can be tricky. I remember there are methods like factoring, rational root theorem, synthetic division, or maybe even using the cubic formula, but that's pretty complicated. Let me see if I can factor this or find rational roots.The rational root theorem says that any possible rational root, p/q, is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. So, the constant term here is -22, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, possible roots could be ±1, ±2, ±11, ±22, and then divided by 1 or 2. So, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±11, ±22, ±1/2, ±11/2.Let me test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation.First, let's try x=1:2(1)^3 -5(1)^2 +3(1) -22 = 2 -5 +3 -22 = (2-5) + (3-22) = (-3) + (-19) = -22 ≠ 0Not a root.x=2:2(8) -5(4) +3(2) -22 = 16 -20 +6 -22 = (16-20) + (6-22) = (-4) + (-16) = -20 ≠ 0Not a root.x=11: That seems too big, but let's check:2(1331) -5(121) +3(11) -22 = 2662 -605 +33 -22 = 2662 -605 is 2057, 2057 +33 is 2090, 2090 -22 is 2068 ≠ 0Definitely not.x= -1:2(-1)^3 -5(-1)^2 +3(-1) -22 = -2 -5 -3 -22 = -32 ≠ 0x= -2:2(-8) -5(4) +3(-2) -22 = -16 -20 -6 -22 = -64 ≠ 0x=1/2:2(1/8) -5(1/4) +3(1/2) -22 = 0.25 -1.25 +1.5 -22 = (0.25 -1.25) + (1.5 -22) = (-1) + (-20.5) = -21.5 ≠ 0x=11/2: That's 5.5. Let's compute:2*(5.5)^3 -5*(5.5)^2 +3*(5.5) -22First, 5.5³ is 5.5*5.5=30.25, then 30.25*5.5. Let me compute that:30.25 * 5 = 151.2530.25 * 0.5 = 15.125So total is 151.25 +15.125 = 166.375So 2*166.375 = 332.75Next term: 5*(5.5)^2. 5.5 squared is 30.25, so 5*30.25=151.25Third term: 3*5.5=16.5So putting it all together:332.75 -151.25 +16.5 -22Compute step by step:332.75 -151.25 = 181.5181.5 +16.5 = 198198 -22 = 176 ≠ 0So x=11/2 is not a root.Hmm, none of the rational roots seem to work. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations? Let me double-check x=2:2*(8) =16, -5*(4)= -20, +3*(2)=6, -22. So 16-20= -4, -4+6=2, 2-22= -20. Yeah, that's correct.x=1: 2 -5 +3 -22= -22. Correct.x=1/2: 0.25 -1.25 +1.5 -22= -21.5. Correct.Hmm, so maybe this cubic doesn't have any rational roots. That complicates things. Maybe I need to use another method.Alternatively, perhaps I can graph the function or use numerical methods to approximate the root.Alternatively, maybe I can factor it as a cubic. Let me see.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of depressed cubic or Cardano's formula, but that might be overkill.Alternatively, maybe I can use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the root.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that it's a cubic and see how it behaves.Let me check the behavior of the function f(x) = 2x³ -5x² +3x -22.Compute f(3): 2*27 -5*9 +9 -22 =54 -45 +9 -22= (54-45)=9, (9+9)=18, (18-22)= -4f(4): 2*64 -5*16 +12 -22=128 -80 +12 -22= (128-80)=48, (48+12)=60, (60-22)=38So f(3)= -4, f(4)=38. So between x=3 and x=4, the function crosses zero. So there's a real root between 3 and 4.Similarly, let's check f(2)= -20, f(3)= -4, so the function is increasing from x=2 to x=3, but still negative.f(1)= -22, f(2)= -20, so it's increasing but still negative.f(0)= -22, f(1)= -22, so it's flat there.Wait, actually, f(0)= -7 -22? Wait, no. Wait, f(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -22. So f(0)= -22.Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast the function correctly.Wait, no, the function is 2x³ -5x² +3x -22. So f(0)= -22.f(1)=2 -5 +3 -22= -22.f(2)=16 -20 +6 -22= -20.f(3)=54 -45 +9 -22= -4.f(4)=128 -80 +12 -22=38.So, the function increases from x=0 to x=4, but it's negative until x=3, where it becomes -4, and then positive at x=4.So, only one real root between 3 and 4.But since it's a cubic, there should be three roots, but maybe two complex and one real.But in this context, since x represents weight lifted, which is a positive real number, so we only care about the positive real root.So, we can use numerical methods to approximate it.Let me try Newton-Raphson.We can start with an initial guess. Since f(3)= -4, f(4)=38, so let's take x0=3.5.Compute f(3.5):2*(3.5)^3 -5*(3.5)^2 +3*(3.5) -22First, 3.5³=42.875, so 2*42.875=85.753.5²=12.25, so 5*12.25=61.253*3.5=10.5So f(3.5)=85.75 -61.25 +10.5 -22Compute step by step:85.75 -61.25=24.524.5 +10.5=3535 -22=13So f(3.5)=13f'(x)=6x² -10x +3f'(3.5)=6*(12.25) -10*(3.5) +3=73.5 -35 +3=41.5So Newton-Raphson update:x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0)= 3.5 -13/41.5≈3.5 -0.313≈3.187Now compute f(3.187):First, 3.187³≈3.187*3.187=10.156, then 10.156*3.187≈32.31So 2*32.31≈64.623.187²≈10.156, so 5*10.156≈50.783*3.187≈9.561So f(3.187)=64.62 -50.78 +9.561 -22≈(64.62-50.78)=13.84, (13.84+9.561)=23.401, (23.401-22)=1.401So f(3.187)≈1.401f'(3.187)=6*(3.187)^2 -10*(3.187)+3≈6*(10.156) -31.87 +3≈60.936 -31.87 +3≈32.066So next iteration:x2=3.187 -1.401/32.066≈3.187 -0.0437≈3.143Compute f(3.143):3.143³≈31.03 (since 3.14³≈31.006)2*31.03≈62.063.143²≈9.877, so 5*9.877≈49.3853*3.143≈9.429So f(3.143)=62.06 -49.385 +9.429 -22≈(62.06-49.385)=12.675, (12.675+9.429)=22.104, (22.104-22)=0.104f'(3.143)=6*(3.143)^2 -10*(3.143)+3≈6*(9.877) -31.43 +3≈59.262 -31.43 +3≈30.832Next iteration:x3=3.143 -0.104/30.832≈3.143 -0.0034≈3.1396Compute f(3.1396):3.1396³≈30.85 (since 3.14³≈31.006, so slightly less)2*30.85≈61.73.1396²≈9.856, so 5*9.856≈49.283*3.1396≈9.419So f(3.1396)=61.7 -49.28 +9.419 -22≈(61.7-49.28)=12.42, (12.42+9.419)=21.839, (21.839-22)= -0.161Wait, that's negative now. Hmm, so f(3.1396)≈-0.161Wait, that's odd because previously at x=3.143, f(x)=0.104, and now at x=3.1396, f(x)= -0.161. So the root is between 3.1396 and 3.143.So let's compute f(3.14):3.14³≈31.0062*31.006≈62.0123.14²≈9.85965*9.8596≈49.2983*3.14≈9.42So f(3.14)=62.012 -49.298 +9.42 -22≈(62.012-49.298)=12.714, (12.714+9.42)=22.134, (22.134-22)=0.134f'(3.14)=6*(3.14)^2 -10*(3.14)+3≈6*(9.8596) -31.4 +3≈59.1576 -31.4 +3≈30.7576So x4=3.14 -0.134/30.7576≈3.14 -0.00436≈3.1356Compute f(3.1356):3.1356³≈30.75 (approx)2*30.75≈61.53.1356²≈9.83, so 5*9.83≈49.153*3.1356≈9.4068So f(3.1356)=61.5 -49.15 +9.4068 -22≈(61.5-49.15)=12.35, (12.35+9.4068)=21.7568, (21.7568-22)= -0.2432Wait, that's even more negative. Hmm, maybe my approximations are off because I'm estimating the cubes and squares.Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for more precise calculations, but since I'm doing this manually, let's try another approach.Alternatively, since f(3.14)=0.134 and f(3.1356)= -0.2432, so the root is between 3.1356 and 3.14.Let me use linear approximation.Between x=3.1356 (f=-0.2432) and x=3.14 (f=0.134). The difference in x is 0.0044, and the difference in f is 0.134 - (-0.2432)=0.3772.We want to find x where f(x)=0. So starting from x=3.1356, which is f=-0.2432, we need to cover 0.2432 to reach 0.The fraction is 0.2432 /0.3772≈0.645So x≈3.1356 +0.645*0.0044≈3.1356 +0.002838≈3.1384So approximately 3.1384.Let me check f(3.1384):Compute 3.1384³:First, 3.1384²= approx 3.1384*3.1384. Let's compute:3*3=93*0.1384=0.41520.1384*3=0.41520.1384*0.1384≈0.01916So total is 9 +0.4152 +0.4152 +0.01916≈9.84956So 3.1384²≈9.84956Then 3.1384³=3.1384*9.84956≈Compute 3*9.84956=29.548680.1384*9.84956≈1.364So total≈29.54868 +1.364≈30.91268So 2x³≈61.825365x²=5*9.84956≈49.24783x≈9.4152So f(x)=61.82536 -49.2478 +9.4152 -22≈61.82536 -49.2478≈12.5775612.57756 +9.4152≈21.9927621.99276 -22≈-0.00724So f(3.1384)≈-0.00724That's very close to zero. Let's do one more iteration.f'(3.1384)=6*(3.1384)^2 -10*(3.1384)+3≈6*(9.84956) -31.384 +3≈59.09736 -31.384 +3≈30.71336So next iteration:x5=3.1384 - (-0.00724)/30.71336≈3.1384 +0.000236≈3.1386Compute f(3.1386):3.1386³≈3.1386*3.1386²≈3.1386*9.849≈30.9142x³≈61.8285x²≈49.2453x≈9.4158So f(x)=61.828 -49.245 +9.4158 -22≈61.828 -49.245≈12.58312.583 +9.4158≈22.022.0 -22≈0So f(3.1386)=0 approximately.So the root is approximately x≈3.1386 kg.But since we're dealing with weight lifting, which is typically measured in whole numbers or halves, maybe we can round it to 3.14 kg or 3.1 kg.But let me check f(3.14):Earlier, I had f(3.14)=0.134, which is positive, and f(3.1386)=0. So the root is approximately 3.1386, which is roughly 3.14 kg.But let's see, if I round to two decimal places, it's 3.14 kg.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact solution, but since it's a cubic without rational roots, perhaps it's expecting a numerical approximation.So, the answer is approximately x≈3.14 kg.Wait, but 3.14 kg seems quite light for a weight lift, especially for rock climbers and hikers. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.Wait, let me double-check the initial equation.The original equation is S(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -7=15So, 2x³ -5x² +3x -7=15Subtract 15: 2x³ -5x² +3x -22=0Yes, that's correct.Wait, maybe I messed up the function definition. Let me check again.The function is S(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -7, and we set that equal to 15.Yes, so 2x³ -5x² +3x -7=15So, 2x³ -5x² +3x -22=0Yes, correct.So, the root is approximately 3.14 kg.But in the context of weight lifting, 3.14 kg is about 7 pounds, which seems too light. Maybe the units are in pounds? Wait, no, the problem says x is in kilograms.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the function. Let me check the original problem again.\\"A fitness blogger is creating a new strength training program for outdoor enthusiasts, including rock climbers and hikers. The program involves exercises focusing on developing the strength needed for ascending steep trails and climbing routes. To determine the appropriate weight for strength exercises, the blogger uses the following polynomial function to model the strength-to-weight ratio required for a given elevation gain:S(x) = 2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 7where S(x) represents the strength-to-weight ratio, and x is the weight (in kilograms) a participant can lift.\\"So, x is in kg, and S(x) is the strength-to-weight ratio. So, the equation is correct.But 3.14 kg seems too light. Maybe the function is supposed to be in pounds? Or maybe the function is defined differently.Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to be S(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -7, where x is the weight lifted in kg, and S(x) is the strength-to-weight ratio. So, to get S(x)=15, x≈3.14 kg.But that seems low. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.Wait, let me try plugging x=3 into the original equation:S(3)=2*27 -5*9 +3*3 -7=54 -45 +9 -7= (54-45)=9, (9+9)=18, (18-7)=11So S(3)=11Similarly, S(4)=2*64 -5*16 +12 -7=128 -80 +12 -7= (128-80)=48, (48+12)=60, (60-7)=53So S(4)=53So, S(3)=11, S(4)=53. So, to get S(x)=15, x is between 3 and 4, which matches our earlier conclusion.But 3.14 kg is only slightly above 3 kg, which is 6.6 pounds. That seems too light for a weight lift, but maybe it's correct because it's a strength-to-weight ratio, not just absolute strength.Wait, strength-to-weight ratio is strength divided by weight. So, if x is the weight lifted, then S(x)=strength/weight=15.So, strength=15x.But the function S(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -7=15So, 2x³ -5x² +3x -22=0So, solving for x gives the weight that when lifted, gives a strength-to-weight ratio of 15.So, the calculation seems correct, even if the weight seems low.Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to be S(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -7, where x is the weight lifted in kg, and S(x) is the strength-to-weight ratio. So, the participant needs to lift x kg such that their strength (which is 2x³ -5x² +3x -7) divided by their weight (x) equals 15.Wait, that would be S(x)= (2x³ -5x² +3x -7)/x=15But the problem states S(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -7, so it's not divided by x. So, S(x) is the strength-to-weight ratio, which is strength divided by weight. So, S(x)=strength/weight=15.But the function is given as S(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -7, so that would mean strength=2x³ -5x² +3x -7, and weight=x, so S(x)=strength/weight= (2x³ -5x² +3x -7)/x=2x² -5x +3 -7/x=15Wait, that's a different equation. Maybe I misinterpreted the function.Wait, the problem says: \\"To determine the appropriate weight for strength exercises, the blogger uses the following polynomial function to model the strength-to-weight ratio required for a given elevation gain: S(x) = 2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 7 where S(x) represents the strength-to-weight ratio, and x is the weight (in kilograms) a participant can lift.\\"So, S(x) is strength-to-weight ratio, which is strength/weight. So, S(x)=strength/weight=2x³ -5x² +3x -7But that would mean strength= (2x³ -5x² +3x -7)*weight. But weight is x, so strength= (2x³ -5x² +3x -7)*x=2x⁴ -5x³ +3x² -7xBut that seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe S(x) is defined as strength/weight, so S(x)= (strength)/x=2x³ -5x² +3x -7So, strength= x*(2x³ -5x² +3x -7)=2x⁴ -5x³ +3x² -7xBut that's a quartic function, which is more complex.But the problem says S(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -7, where S(x) is the strength-to-weight ratio, and x is the weight lifted.So, perhaps S(x)=strength/weight=2x³ -5x² +3x -7Therefore, strength= (2x³ -5x² +3x -7)*x=2x⁴ -5x³ +3x² -7xBut that's a different interpretation. However, the problem states S(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -7, so I think it's safer to take it as given, that S(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -7, and we need to solve 2x³ -5x² +3x -7=15So, 2x³ -5x² +3x -22=0Which we found the root approximately at x≈3.14 kg.So, despite the low weight, I think that's the answer.Now, moving on to part 2: Determine the range of weights x that satisfy the inequality 2x³ -5x² +3x -7 ≥10So, 2x³ -5x² +3x -7 ≥10Subtract 10: 2x³ -5x² +3x -17 ≥0So, we need to solve 2x³ -5x² +3x -17 ≥0Again, this is a cubic inequality. To solve it, we need to find the roots of the equation 2x³ -5x² +3x -17=0, and then determine the intervals where the cubic is positive.Let me try to find the roots of 2x³ -5x² +3x -17=0Again, using rational root theorem: possible roots are ±1, ±17, ±1/2, ±17/2Test x=1: 2 -5 +3 -17= -17 ≠0x=2: 16 -20 +6 -17= -25 ≠0x=17: way too big, but let's see:2*(4913) -5*(289) +3*(17) -17=9826 -1445 +51 -17=9826-1445=8381, 8381+51=8432, 8432-17=8415≠0x=1/2: 2*(1/8) -5*(1/4) +3*(1/2) -17=0.25 -1.25 +1.5 -17= (0.25-1.25)= -1, (-1+1.5)=0.5, (0.5-17)= -16.5≠0x=17/2=8.5:2*(8.5)^3 -5*(8.5)^2 +3*(8.5) -17Compute 8.5³=614.125, so 2*614.125=1228.258.5²=72.25, so 5*72.25=361.253*8.5=25.5So f(8.5)=1228.25 -361.25 +25.5 -17≈(1228.25-361.25)=867, (867+25.5)=892.5, (892.5-17)=875.5≠0So no rational roots. Let's check the behavior of the function.f(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -17Compute f(2)=16 -20 +6 -17= -25f(3)=54 -45 +9 -17=1So f(2)= -25, f(3)=1. So there's a root between 2 and 3.Similarly, f(4)=128 -80 +12 -17=43f(1)=2 -5 +3 -17= -17f(0)= -17f(-1)= -2 -5 -3 -17= -27So, the function is negative at x=0, negative at x=1, negative at x=2, positive at x=3, and positive beyond.So, only one real root between 2 and 3.Let me use Newton-Raphson to approximate it.Start with x0=2.5f(2.5)=2*(15.625) -5*(6.25) +7.5 -17=31.25 -31.25 +7.5 -17= (31.25-31.25)=0, (0+7.5)=7.5, (7.5-17)= -9.5f'(x)=6x² -10x +3f'(2.5)=6*(6.25) -25 +3=37.5 -25 +3=15.5x1=2.5 - (-9.5)/15.5≈2.5 +0.6129≈3.1129Compute f(3.1129):3.1129³≈30.0 (approx)2*30≈603.1129²≈9.6895*9.689≈48.4453*3.1129≈9.3387So f(3.1129)=60 -48.445 +9.3387 -17≈(60-48.445)=11.555, (11.555+9.3387)=20.8937, (20.8937-17)=3.8937f'(3.1129)=6*(9.689) -10*(3.1129)+3≈58.134 -31.129 +3≈30.005x2=3.1129 -3.8937/30.005≈3.1129 -0.1298≈2.9831Compute f(2.9831):2.9831³≈26.5 (approx)2*26.5≈532.9831²≈8.95*8.9≈44.53*2.9831≈8.9493So f(2.9831)=53 -44.5 +8.9493 -17≈(53-44.5)=8.5, (8.5+8.9493)=17.4493, (17.4493-17)=0.4493f'(2.9831)=6*(8.9) -10*(2.9831)+3≈53.4 -29.831 +3≈26.569x3=2.9831 -0.4493/26.569≈2.9831 -0.0169≈2.9662Compute f(2.9662):2.9662³≈26.0 (approx)2*26≈522.9662²≈8.85*8.8≈443*2.9662≈8.8986So f(2.9662)=52 -44 +8.8986 -17≈(52-44)=8, (8+8.8986)=16.8986, (16.8986-17)= -0.1014f'(2.9662)=6*(8.8) -10*(2.9662)+3≈52.8 -29.662 +3≈26.138x4=2.9662 - (-0.1014)/26.138≈2.9662 +0.0039≈2.9701Compute f(2.9701):2.9701³≈26.1 (approx)2*26.1≈52.22.9701²≈8.825*8.82≈44.13*2.9701≈8.9103So f(2.9701)=52.2 -44.1 +8.9103 -17≈(52.2-44.1)=8.1, (8.1+8.9103)=17.0103, (17.0103-17)=0.0103f'(2.9701)=6*(8.82) -10*(2.9701)+3≈52.92 -29.701 +3≈26.219x5=2.9701 -0.0103/26.219≈2.9701 -0.0004≈2.9697Compute f(2.9697):2.9697³≈26.08 (approx)2*26.08≈52.162.9697²≈8.825*8.82≈44.13*2.9697≈8.9091So f(2.9697)=52.16 -44.1 +8.9091 -17≈(52.16-44.1)=8.06, (8.06+8.9091)=16.9691, (16.9691-17)= -0.0309Wait, that's negative again. Hmm, maybe my approximations are off.Alternatively, let's use linear approximation between x=2.9697 (f≈-0.0309) and x=2.9701 (f≈0.0103)The difference in x is 0.0004, and the difference in f is 0.0103 - (-0.0309)=0.0412We need to find x where f=0. So starting from x=2.9697, which is f=-0.0309, we need to cover 0.0309 to reach 0.The fraction is 0.0309 /0.0412≈0.75So x≈2.9697 +0.75*0.0004≈2.9697 +0.0003≈2.96997≈2.97So, the root is approximately x≈2.97 kg.Wait, but earlier, f(2.9701)=0.0103 and f(2.9697)= -0.0309, so the root is around 2.97 kg.So, the cubic function f(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -17 crosses zero at approximately x≈2.97 kg.Since the leading coefficient is positive, the cubic tends to +∞ as x→∞ and -∞ as x→-∞. So, the function is negative before the root and positive after.But wait, let's check the behavior:f(x)=2x³ -5x² +3x -17As x approaches +∞, f(x)→+∞As x approaches -∞, f(x)→-∞So, since it's a cubic with one real root, the function is negative for x < root and positive for x > root.Therefore, the inequality 2x³ -5x² +3x -17 ≥0 is satisfied for x ≥ approximately 2.97 kg.But let's confirm by testing a value greater than 2.97, say x=3:f(3)=54 -45 +9 -17=1, which is positive.And a value less than 2.97, say x=2:f(2)=16 -20 +6 -17= -25, which is negative.So, the solution to the inequality is x ≥ approximately 2.97 kg.But since we're dealing with weight lifting, which is typically measured in whole numbers or halves, we can round it to x ≥3 kg.But let me check f(3)=1, which is positive, so x=3 is included.Therefore, the range of weights x that satisfy the inequality is x ≥ approximately 2.97 kg, which we can round to x ≥3 kg.But wait, in part 1, we found x≈3.14 kg for S(x)=15, and in part 2, x≈2.97 kg for S(x)=10.So, the range of weights where S(x)≥10 is x≥2.97 kg, which is approximately x≥3 kg.But let me check if the function is increasing or decreasing around the root.Compute f'(x)=6x² -10x +3At x=2.97, f'(2.97)=6*(8.82) -10*(2.97)+3≈52.92 -29.7 +3≈26.22>0So, the function is increasing at the root, meaning it crosses from negative to positive, confirming that for x≥2.97, f(x)≥0.Therefore, the range of weights is x≥ approximately 2.97 kg.But since the problem is about participants maintaining a minimum strength-to-weight ratio of 10, which is a safety measure, it's better to round up to the next whole number, so x≥3 kg.But let me check f(3)=1, which is positive, so x=3 is included.Therefore, the range is x≥3 kg.But wait, in part 1, the weight was approximately 3.14 kg for S(x)=15, which is higher than 3 kg.So, the range for S(x)≥10 is x≥3 kg.But let me confirm with x=3:S(3)=2*27 -5*9 +3*3 -7=54 -45 +9 -7=11, which is ≥10.And x=2.97:S(2.97)=2*(2.97)^3 -5*(2.97)^2 +3*(2.97) -7≈2*(26.08) -5*(8.82) +8.91 -7≈52.16 -44.1 +8.91 -7≈(52.16-44.1)=8.06, (8.06+8.91)=16.97, (16.97-7)=9.97≈10So, at x≈2.97, S(x)=10, and for x>2.97, S(x)>10.Therefore, the range is x≥2.97 kg, which we can approximate as x≥3 kg.So, summarizing:1. The weight x that gives S(x)=15 is approximately 3.14 kg.2. The range of weights x that satisfy S(x)≥10 is x≥ approximately 2.97 kg, which is roughly x≥3 kg.But since the problem might expect exact values or a more precise answer, perhaps we can express the roots in terms of the cubic equation, but since they don't factor nicely, numerical approximations are the way to go.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the cubic equation's roots, but I think numerical answers are more practical here.So, final answers:1. x≈3.14 kg2. x≥3 kgBut let me check if the problem expects the answer in a specific format, like interval notation.For part 2, the solution is all real numbers x such that x≥ approximately 2.97 kg, which can be written as [2.97, ∞).

The weight x that gives S(x)=15 is approximately 3.14 kg.2. The range of weights x that satisfy S(x)≥10 is x≥ approximately 2.97 kg, which is roughly x≥3 kg.But to be precise, since the exact root is approximately 2.97, we can write it as x≥2.97 kg, but for practical purposes, rounding to one decimal place, x≥3.0 kg.Alternatively, if the problem expects more precision, we can write x≥2.97 kg.But given the context, rounding to two decimal places, x≥2.97 kg is acceptable.So, final answers:1. x≈3.14 kg2. x≥2.97 kgBut let me check if the problem expects the answer in a specific format, like interval notation.For part 2, the solution is all real numbers x such that x≥ approximately 2.97 kg, which can be written as [2.97, ∞).

First, I know that the expression ((1 - 4x)^{10}) can be expanded using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that ((a + b)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k). In this case, (a = 1), (b = -4x), and (n = 10). So, expanding this, each term (a_k) would be (binom{10}{k} (1)^{10 - k} (-4x)^k). Simplifying that, (a_k = binom{10}{k} (-4)^k).So, the expansion is (a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + dots + a_{10}x^{10}), where each coefficient (a_k = binom{10}{k} (-4)^k).Now, the problem is asking for the sum (frac{a_1}{2} + frac{a_2}{2^2} + dots + frac{a_{10}}{2^{10}}). That is, for each (k) from 1 to 10, we take (a_k) and divide it by (2^k), then sum all those up.Let me write this sum as (S = sum_{k=1}^{10} frac{a_k}{2^k}).Since we know that (a_k = binom{10}{k} (-4)^k), substituting that into the sum gives:(S = sum_{k=1}^{10} frac{binom{10}{k} (-4)^k}{2^k}).Simplify the fraction inside the sum:(frac{(-4)^k}{2^k} = left( frac{-4}{2} right)^k = (-2)^k).So, now the sum becomes:(S = sum_{k=1}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-2)^k).Hmm, that looks familiar. It's almost like the expansion of ((1 + (-2))^{10}), except that the binomial expansion starts at (k=0). Let me recall that:((1 + x)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^k).So, if I let (x = -2), then:((1 - 2)^{10} = sum_{k=0}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-2)^k).Which means:((-1)^{10} = sum_{k=0}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-2)^k).Since ((-1)^{10} = 1), so:(1 = sum_{k=0}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-2)^k).But our sum (S) is from (k=1) to (10), so if we subtract the (k=0) term from both sides, we get:(1 - binom{10}{0} (-2)^0 = sum_{k=1}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-2)^k).Calculating the (k=0) term: (binom{10}{0} (-2)^0 = 1 times 1 = 1).So, substituting back:(1 - 1 = sum_{k=1}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-2)^k).Which simplifies to:(0 = sum_{k=1}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-2)^k).Wait, but that means (S = 0)? But let me double-check because that seems a bit surprising.Wait, let's go back. The original expression is ((1 - 4x)^{10}), and we're evaluating the sum (S = sum_{k=1}^{10} frac{a_k}{2^k}). If I substitute (x = frac{1}{2}) into the expansion, what happens?Let me think. If I plug (x = frac{1}{2}) into the expansion:((1 - 4 times frac{1}{2})^{10} = (1 - 2)^{10} = (-1)^{10} = 1).But the expansion at (x = frac{1}{2}) is:(a_0 + a_1 times frac{1}{2} + a_2 times left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 + dots + a_{10} times left( frac{1}{2} right)^{10}).Which is exactly:(a_0 + frac{a_1}{2} + frac{a_2}{2^2} + dots + frac{a_{10}}{2^{10}} = 1).But the sum (S) is just the part from (a_1) to (a_{10}), so:(S = left( a_0 + frac{a_1}{2} + frac{a_2}{2^2} + dots + frac{a_{10}}{2^{10}} right) - a_0 = 1 - a_0).So, if I can find (a_0), then I can compute (S).But (a_0) is the constant term in the expansion of ((1 - 4x)^{10}), which is just (binom{10}{0} (-4)^0 = 1).Therefore, (S = 1 - 1 = 0).Wait, so that confirms the earlier result. So, (S = 0).But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in reasoning. So, if I substitute (x = frac{1}{2}), I get the sum (a_0 + frac{a_1}{2} + dots + frac{a_{10}}{2^{10}} = 1). Since (a_0 = 1), subtracting it gives (S = 0).Alternatively, thinking in terms of the binomial expansion, when I set (x = frac{1}{2}), the entire expression becomes 1, which is equal to the sum of all the terms, including (a_0). Therefore, the sum of the terms from (a_1) onwards must be (1 - a_0 = 0).So, both methods lead to the same conclusion, which is that (S = 0).But just to be thorough, let me compute (S) another way. Since (S = sum_{k=1}^{10} frac{a_k}{2^k}), and (a_k = binom{10}{k} (-4)^k), then:(S = sum_{k=1}^{10} frac{binom{10}{k} (-4)^k}{2^k} = sum_{k=1}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-2)^k).As I thought earlier, this is the same as the expansion of ((1 - 2)^{10}) minus the (k=0) term.So, ((1 - 2)^{10} = sum_{k=0}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-2)^k = (-1)^{10} = 1).Thus, (sum_{k=0}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-2)^k = 1), so subtracting the (k=0) term (which is 1) gives:(sum_{k=1}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-2)^k = 1 - 1 = 0).Therefore, (S = 0).So, after checking it multiple ways, I'm confident that the answer is 0.**Final Answer**boxed{0}"},{"question":"Let   d_n  be the determinant of the   ntimes n  matrix whose entries, from left to right and then from top to bottom, are   cos 1,cos 2,dots,cos n^2.  (For example,   d_3 equal{} begin{vmatrix}cos 1 & cos2 & cos3 \\rcos4 & cos5 & cos 6 \\rcos7 & cos8 & cos 9end{vmatrix}.  The argument of    cos   is always in radians, not degrees.)\\r\\rEvaluate   lim_{ntoinfty}d_n. ","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to evaluate the limit of the determinant ( d_n ) as ( n ) approaches infinity. The determinant is of an ( n times n ) matrix where each entry is filled with cosine values from 1 to ( n^2 ) radians. For example, when ( n = 3 ), the matrix is:[begin{pmatrix}cos 1 & cos 2 & cos 3 cos 4 & cos 5 & cos 6 cos 7 & cos 8 & cos 9end{pmatrix}]And ( d_3 ) is the determinant of this matrix. The question is asking for ( lim_{n to infty} d_n ).Hmm, determinants of large matrices can be tricky, especially when the entries are cosines of integers. I need to figure out if there's a pattern or property of these matrices that can help me evaluate the limit without computing the determinant directly for each ( n ).First, let me recall that the determinant of a matrix can be interpreted as the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by its column vectors. If the column vectors become nearly linearly dependent as ( n ) grows, the determinant might approach zero. Alternatively, if the vectors are orthogonal or nearly orthogonal, the determinant might approach a non-zero value.But in this case, the entries are cosines of integers. I wonder if these cosine values have some properties that can be exploited. Cosine is a periodic function with period ( 2pi ), so the arguments here are just integers, which are not multiples of ( 2pi ) (except for 0, which isn't in our range). So, each entry is ( cos(k) ) where ( k ) ranges from 1 to ( n^2 ).Wait, maybe I can think about the behavior of these cosine values. Since ( k ) increases, the arguments ( k ) radians are spread out over the unit circle. So, each ( cos(k) ) is just a point on the unit circle, but as ( k ) increases, these points are distributed in a somewhat random fashion around the circle because ( 1 ) radian is not a rational multiple of ( pi ), so the sequence ( cos(k) ) doesn't repeat periodically.This seems similar to a matrix with independent random entries, except here the entries are deterministic but have a kind of pseudo-random behavior due to the equidistribution of ( k ) mod ( 2pi ). Maybe I can use some concepts from random matrix theory here.In random matrix theory, for large ( n ), the determinant of a matrix with independent entries (like Gaussian random variables) tends to have a certain distribution, but the exact limit of the determinant is more nuanced. However, for structured matrices, like those with entries that are cosines of integers, the behavior might be different.Alternatively, maybe I can analyze the matrix as a kind of Toeplitz or Hankel matrix, but I don't think that's the case here. The entries are filled sequentially, so it's more like a filled matrix rather than a Toeplitz or Hankel structure.Wait, another thought: if the matrix is filled with cosines of integers, which are bounded between -1 and 1, perhaps the matrix is a kind of structured matrix with low numerical rank? Or maybe it's a kind of circulant matrix? But no, a circulant matrix has each row vector rotated one element to the right relative to the preceding row vector, which isn't the case here.Alternatively, perhaps the matrix can be approximated by a low-rank matrix, which would imply that the determinant is small because the determinant is sensitive to the rank of the matrix. If the matrix has low numerical rank, then its determinant might approach zero as ( n ) increases.But I need to think more concretely. Maybe I can consider the properties of the cosine function and how it behaves when its argument is an integer. Since ( cos(k) ) for integer ( k ) doesn't have any particular periodicity, the values are distributed in a way that might be similar to random variables. So, perhaps the matrix behaves similarly to a random matrix with independent entries, but with a specific distribution.Wait, in random matrix theory, for matrices with independent entries with mean zero and variance one, the determinant tends to have a certain behavior. But in our case, the entries are ( cos(k) ), which have a mean of zero? Let me check.The average of ( cos(k) ) over integers ( k ) is zero because cosine is an oscillating function, and over a large number of points, the positive and negative areas cancel out. So, the mean is zero. The variance would be ( frac{1}{2} ), since ( cos^2(k) ) averages to ( frac{1}{2} ).So, each entry has mean zero and variance ( frac{1}{2} ). So, if we consider the matrix as a kind of random matrix with independent entries with mean zero and variance ( frac{1}{2} ), then perhaps we can use results from random matrix theory.In random matrix theory, for an ( n times n ) matrix with independent entries of mean zero and variance ( sigma^2 ), the expected value of the determinant squared is ( (n-1)! sigma^{2n} ). But the determinant itself is a complicated object, and its distribution is not straightforward.However, for such matrices, as ( n ) becomes large, the determinant tends to be dominated by the product of the singular values. The determinant is the product of the singular values, and for a random matrix, the singular values are distributed according to the Marchenko-Pastur distribution. The smallest singular value tends to zero as ( n ) increases, which would imply that the determinant, being the product of all singular values, also tends to zero.But wait, in our case, the entries are not independent. The matrix is filled sequentially with ( cos(1), cos(2), dots, cos(n^2) ). So, the entries are dependent in a structured way, not independent. So, I can't directly apply random matrix theory results here.Hmm, so maybe I need another approach. Let's think about the properties of the cosine function and how they might affect the linear independence of the rows or columns.Each row of the matrix is a sequence of cosines of consecutive integers. Since cosine is a smooth function, consecutive values are correlated. So, each row is a kind of smooth curve, which might lead to linear dependence among the rows or columns.Wait, but as ( n ) increases, the number of rows and columns increases, and each row is a different sequence of cosines. But since the arguments are just increasing integers, each row is just a shifted version of the previous row by one integer. So, the rows are highly correlated.Similarly, the columns are also sequences of cosines of integers, but each column is offset by ( n ) from the previous column. So, each column is a sequence like ( cos(k), cos(k + n), cos(k + 2n), dots ) for some starting ( k ).Wait, that's an interesting point. Let me think about the columns. Each column is a sequence of cosines with arguments increasing by ( n ) each time. So, for column ( j ), the entries are ( cos(j), cos(j + n), cos(j + 2n), dots, cos(j + (n-1)n) ).So, each column is a sequence of cosines with arguments in arithmetic progression with common difference ( n ). So, the entries in each column are ( cos(j + kn) ) for ( k = 0, 1, dots, n-1 ).Now, using the identity for cosine of sums:[cos(j + kn) = cos(j)cos(kn) - sin(j)sin(kn)]So, each column can be expressed as a linear combination of ( cos(kn) ) and ( sin(kn) ). But wait, ( cos(kn) ) and ( sin(kn) ) are functions of ( k ), so each column is a linear combination of two vectors: one with entries ( cos(kn) ) and another with entries ( sin(kn) ).Therefore, each column lies in the span of two vectors: ( [cos(0), cos(n), cos(2n), dots, cos((n-1)n)] ) and ( [sin(0), sin(n), sin(2n), dots, sin((n-1)n)] ).Wait, so that would mean that all columns lie in a two-dimensional subspace. Therefore, the column space of the matrix has dimension at most 2, regardless of ( n ). Therefore, for ( n geq 3 ), the matrix has rank at most 2, which means that the determinant is zero because the determinant of a matrix with rank less than ( n ) is zero.Wait, hold on, that seems like a key insight. If all columns lie in a two-dimensional subspace, then the matrix is rank-deficient, and hence its determinant is zero. But wait, is that the case?Let me double-check. Each column is expressed as a linear combination of two vectors: ( cos(kn) ) and ( sin(kn) ). So, if I denote ( v_1 = [cos(0), cos(n), cos(2n), dots, cos((n-1)n)] ) and ( v_2 = [sin(0), sin(n), sin(2n), dots, sin((n-1)n)] ), then each column ( c_j ) can be written as ( c_j = cos(j) v_1 - sin(j) v_2 ).Therefore, all columns are linear combinations of ( v_1 ) and ( v_2 ). Therefore, the column space is at most two-dimensional. So, for any ( n geq 3 ), the matrix has rank at most 2, hence determinant zero.Wait, but in the example given, ( d_3 ) is the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. If the rank is at most 2, then ( d_3 = 0 ). But is that actually the case?Let me compute ( d_3 ) numerically to check.Compute the determinant:[begin{vmatrix}cos 1 & cos 2 & cos 3 cos 4 & cos 5 & cos 6 cos 7 & cos 8 & cos 9end{vmatrix}]Calculating each cosine:- ( cos 1 approx 0.5403 )- ( cos 2 approx -0.4161 )- ( cos 3 approx -0.98999 )- ( cos 4 approx -0.6536 )- ( cos 5 approx 0.2817 )- ( cos 6 approx 0.96017 )- ( cos 7 approx 0.7539 )- ( cos 8 approx -0.1455 )- ( cos 9 approx -0.9111 )So, the matrix is approximately:[begin{pmatrix}0.5403 & -0.4161 & -0.98999 -0.6536 & 0.2817 & 0.96017 0.7539 & -0.1455 & -0.9111end{pmatrix}]Calculating the determinant:Using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let me use cofactor expansion along the first row.( d_3 = 0.5403 cdot begin{vmatrix} 0.2817 & 0.96017  -0.1455 & -0.9111 end{vmatrix} - (-0.4161) cdot begin{vmatrix} -0.6536 & 0.96017  0.7539 & -0.9111 end{vmatrix} + (-0.98999) cdot begin{vmatrix} -0.6536 & 0.2817  0.7539 & -0.1455 end{vmatrix} )Compute each minor:First minor: ( (0.2817)(-0.9111) - (0.96017)(-0.1455) approx (-0.2567) - (-0.1398) = -0.2567 + 0.1398 = -0.1169 )Second minor: ( (-0.6536)(-0.9111) - (0.96017)(0.7539) approx 0.5966 - 0.7239 = -0.1273 )Third minor: ( (-0.6536)(-0.1455) - (0.2817)(0.7539) approx 0.0950 - 0.2123 = -0.1173 )So, plugging back in:( d_3 approx 0.5403 times (-0.1169) - (-0.4161) times (-0.1273) + (-0.98999) times (-0.1173) )Calculate each term:First term: ( 0.5403 times (-0.1169) approx -0.0632 )Second term: ( -(-0.4161) times (-0.1273) = -0.4161 times 0.1273 approx -0.0530 )Third term: ( (-0.98999) times (-0.1173) approx 0.1160 )Adding them up: ( -0.0632 - 0.0530 + 0.1160 approx (-0.1162) + 0.1160 approx -0.0002 )So, ( d_3 approx -0.0002 ), which is very close to zero. That seems to confirm that the determinant is indeed approaching zero as ( n ) increases.Therefore, if for ( n = 3 ), the determinant is nearly zero, and as ( n ) increases, the determinant remains zero because the rank is at most 2, which is less than ( n ) for ( n geq 3 ). Hence, the determinant ( d_n ) is zero for all ( n geq 3 ), so the limit as ( n to infty ) is zero.But wait, let me think again. The argument I made earlier was that each column is a linear combination of two vectors, hence the rank is at most 2. Therefore, for ( n geq 3 ), the determinant is zero. So, the limit is zero.But just to make sure, let me consider ( n = 2 ). For ( n = 2 ), the determinant is:[begin{vmatrix}cos 1 & cos 2 cos 3 & cos 4end{vmatrix}= cos 1 cos 4 - cos 2 cos 3]Calculating numerically:( cos 1 approx 0.5403 ), ( cos 4 approx -0.6536 ), ( cos 2 approx -0.4161 ), ( cos 3 approx -0.98999 ).So, determinant ( approx 0.5403 times (-0.6536) - (-0.4161) times (-0.98999) approx (-0.3532) - (0.4113) approx -0.7645 ), which is not zero. So, for ( n = 2 ), the determinant is non-zero.But for ( n = 3 ), it's nearly zero, and for ( n geq 3 ), it's exactly zero? Wait, no, for ( n = 3 ), it's approximately zero, but not exactly. However, as ( n ) increases, the rank remains at most 2, so the determinant must be zero for all ( n geq 3 ). Therefore, the limit as ( n to infty ) is zero.Wait, but in reality, for ( n = 3 ), the determinant is approximately -0.0002, which is very close to zero but not exactly zero. So, maybe for finite ( n ), the determinant is non-zero, but as ( n ) increases, the determinant tends to zero.But according to the earlier reasoning, for any ( n geq 3 ), the determinant is zero because the rank is at most 2. So, why is the numerical computation for ( n = 3 ) giving a non-zero determinant?Wait, perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed. Let me reconsider.I said that each column is a linear combination of two vectors ( v_1 ) and ( v_2 ). So, the column space is at most two-dimensional, hence rank at most 2. Therefore, for ( n geq 3 ), the determinant must be zero.But in reality, when I computed ( d_3 ), it was approximately -0.0002, which is very small but not exactly zero. So, is there a mistake in my reasoning?Wait, perhaps the columns are not exactly linear combinations of ( v_1 ) and ( v_2 ), but only approximately so? Or maybe the dependency is only approximate?Wait, let me write out the columns explicitly.For column ( j ), the entries are ( cos(j + kn) ) for ( k = 0, 1, 2 ) (since ( n = 3 )).So, for ( j = 1 ), the column is ( cos(1), cos(4), cos(7) ).Similarly, ( j = 2 ): ( cos(2), cos(5), cos(8) ).( j = 3 ): ( cos(3), cos(6), cos(9) ).Now, according to the identity:( cos(j + kn) = cos(j)cos(kn) - sin(j)sin(kn) ).So, each column is a linear combination of ( cos(kn) ) and ( sin(kn) ), with coefficients ( cos(j) ) and ( -sin(j) ).Therefore, each column is a linear combination of the vectors ( v_1 = [cos(0), cos(n), cos(2n)] ) and ( v_2 = [sin(0), sin(n), sin(2n)] ).So, for ( n = 3 ), ( v_1 = [cos(0), cos(3), cos(6)] approx [1, -0.98999, 0.96017] ).( v_2 = [sin(0), sin(3), sin(6)] approx [0, 0.1411, -0.2794] ).So, each column is a linear combination of these two vectors. Therefore, the column space is indeed two-dimensional, so the rank is at most 2. Therefore, the determinant must be zero.But when I computed it numerically, I got approximately -0.0002. That suggests that the determinant is not exactly zero, but very close to zero.Wait, perhaps due to numerical precision? Let me check the exact value.Alternatively, maybe my initial assumption is wrong because ( cos(kn) ) and ( sin(kn) ) are not exact for integer ( k ), but they are just real numbers. So, in reality, the columns are not exactly in the span of ( v_1 ) and ( v_2 ), but only approximately?Wait, no, the identity ( cos(j + kn) = cos(j)cos(kn) - sin(j)sin(kn) ) is exact. So, each column is exactly a linear combination of ( v_1 ) and ( v_2 ). Therefore, the columns lie exactly in the span of ( v_1 ) and ( v_2 ), which is two-dimensional. Therefore, for ( n = 3 ), the determinant should be exactly zero.But when I computed it numerically, I got approximately -0.0002, which is very small but not exactly zero. So, perhaps the numerical computation is suffering from precision issues?Let me try to compute the determinant symbolically.Wait, for ( n = 3 ), the determinant is:[begin{vmatrix}cos 1 & cos 2 & cos 3 cos 4 & cos 5 & cos 6 cos 7 & cos 8 & cos 9end{vmatrix}]But since each column is a linear combination of ( v_1 ) and ( v_2 ), the determinant should be zero. So, perhaps my numerical computation was just an approximation error.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant exactly using trigonometric identities.Alternatively, perhaps the determinant is not exactly zero, but tends to zero as ( n ) increases.Wait, but if for each ( n geq 3 ), the determinant is zero, then the limit is zero. But in reality, for ( n = 3 ), the determinant is approximately zero but not exactly. So, perhaps as ( n ) increases, the determinant becomes smaller and smaller, approaching zero.Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, for each ( n geq 3 ), the determinant is zero because the rank is at most 2. So, perhaps the determinant is exactly zero for all ( n geq 3 ). But why is the numerical computation giving a small non-zero value?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the numerical computation. Let me recompute ( d_3 ) more accurately.Compute each entry:- ( cos 1 approx 0.54030230586 )- ( cos 2 approx -0.41614683654 )- ( cos 3 approx -0.98999249660 )- ( cos 4 approx -0.65364362086 )- ( cos 5 approx 0.28173255684 )- ( cos 6 approx 0.96017050259 )- ( cos 7 approx 0.75390225434 )- ( cos 8 approx -0.14550003380 )- ( cos 9 approx -0.91113026189 )So, the matrix is:Row 1: 0.54030230586, -0.41614683654, -0.98999249660Row 2: -0.65364362086, 0.28173255684, 0.96017050259Row 3: 0.75390225434, -0.14550003380, -0.91113026189Compute the determinant:Using the formula for a 3x3 determinant:[d_3 = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)]Where the matrix is:[begin{pmatrix}a & b & c d & e & f g & h & iend{pmatrix}]So, plugging in the values:( a = 0.54030230586 ), ( b = -0.41614683654 ), ( c = -0.98999249660 )( d = -0.65364362086 ), ( e = 0.28173255684 ), ( f = 0.96017050259 )( g = 0.75390225434 ), ( h = -0.14550003380 ), ( i = -0.91113026189 )Compute each term:First term: ( a(ei - fh) )Compute ( ei = 0.28173255684 times (-0.91113026189) approx -0.2566 )Compute ( fh = 0.96017050259 times (-0.14550003380) approx -0.1398 )So, ( ei - fh approx -0.2566 - (-0.1398) = -0.1168 )Multiply by ( a ): ( 0.54030230586 times (-0.1168) approx -0.0632 )Second term: ( -b(di - fg) )Compute ( di = (-0.65364362086) times (-0.91113026189) approx 0.5966 )Compute ( fg = 0.96017050259 times 0.75390225434 approx 0.7239 )So, ( di - fg approx 0.5966 - 0.7239 = -0.1273 )Multiply by ( -b ): ( -(-0.41614683654) times (-0.1273) approx -0.0530 )Third term: ( c(dh - eg) )Compute ( dh = (-0.65364362086) times (-0.14550003380) approx 0.0950 )Compute ( eg = 0.28173255684 times 0.75390225434 approx 0.2123 )So, ( dh - eg approx 0.0950 - 0.2123 = -0.1173 )Multiply by ( c ): ( -0.98999249660 times (-0.1173) approx 0.1160 )Now, sum all three terms:( -0.0632 - 0.0530 + 0.1160 = (-0.1162) + 0.1160 = -0.0002 )So, the determinant is approximately -0.0002, which is very close to zero. So, in exact arithmetic, it should be zero, but due to the approximations in the cosine values, the numerical computation gives a very small number.Therefore, this suggests that for ( n = 3 ), the determinant is zero, but due to the precision of the cosine values, it's computed as approximately -0.0002. So, in reality, it's exactly zero.Therefore, for all ( n geq 3 ), the determinant ( d_n ) is zero because the rank of the matrix is at most 2, which is less than ( n ). Therefore, the determinant is zero for all ( n geq 3 ), so the limit as ( n to infty ) is zero.Hence, the answer is ( boxed{0} ).**Final Answer**boxed{0}"},{"question":"As an investment associate at a Private Equity firm, you are analyzing two potential investment opportunities. The first opportunity involves investing in a company whose projected profit can be modeled by the polynomial equation ( P(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 ), where ( x ) is the number of years since the investment was made. The second opportunity involves a company's profit that grows according to the quadratic equation ( Q(x) = -x^2 + 6x + 8 ).1. Determine the number of years ( x ) after which both companies will have the same profit. This requires you to solve the equation ( P(x) = Q(x) ).2. Once you find the values of ( x ) from the first sub-problem, determine for which interval of years the first company's profit exceeds the second company's profit by solving the inequality ( P(x) > Q(x) ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to analyze two investment opportunities for a private equity firm. The profits of the two companies are modeled by two different equations: a cubic polynomial for the first company, ( P(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 ), and a quadratic equation for the second company, ( Q(x) = -x^2 + 6x + 8 ). The first task is to find the number of years ( x ) after which both companies will have the same profit. That means I need to solve the equation ( P(x) = Q(x) ). Okay, so let me write that out:( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 = -x^2 + 6x + 8 )Hmm, to solve this, I should bring all the terms to one side so that the equation equals zero. Let me subtract ( Q(x) ) from both sides:( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 - (-x^2 + 6x + 8) = 0 )Simplifying that, I distribute the negative sign:( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 + x^2 - 6x - 8 = 0 )Now, combine like terms:- The ( x^3 ) term: ( 2x^3 )- The ( x^2 ) terms: ( -5x^2 + x^2 = -4x^2 )- The ( x ) terms: ( 3x - 6x = -3x )- The constants: ( -4 - 8 = -12 )So, putting it all together, the equation becomes:( 2x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x - 12 = 0 )Alright, now I have a cubic equation: ( 2x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x - 12 = 0 ). I need to find the real roots of this equation because they represent the years when the profits are equal.Solving cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor this. Let me try to factor by grouping or see if there are any rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction ( frac{p}{q} ), is such that ( p ) is a factor of the constant term and ( q ) is a factor of the leading coefficient.In this case, the constant term is -12, and the leading coefficient is 2. So possible values for ( p ) are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±12, and possible values for ( q ) are ±1, ±2. Therefore, possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±12, ±1/2, ±3/2, etc.Let me test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation.First, let's try ( x = 1 ):( 2(1)^3 - 4(1)^2 - 3(1) - 12 = 2 - 4 - 3 - 12 = -17 neq 0 )Not a root.Next, ( x = 2 ):( 2(8) - 4(4) - 3(2) - 12 = 16 - 16 - 6 - 12 = -18 neq 0 )Still not a root.How about ( x = 3 ):( 2(27) - 4(9) - 3(3) - 12 = 54 - 36 - 9 - 12 = -3 neq 0 )Close, but not zero.Let me try ( x = 4 ):( 2(64) - 4(16) - 3(4) - 12 = 128 - 64 - 12 - 12 = 40 neq 0 )Nope.What about ( x = -1 ):( 2(-1)^3 - 4(-1)^2 - 3(-1) - 12 = -2 - 4 + 3 - 12 = -15 neq 0 )Not a root.Trying ( x = 1/2 ):( 2(1/8) - 4(1/4) - 3(1/2) - 12 = 0.25 - 1 - 1.5 - 12 = -14.25 neq 0 )Not a root.How about ( x = 3/2 ):( 2(27/8) - 4(9/4) - 3(3/2) - 12 )Calculating each term:- ( 2*(27/8) = 54/8 = 6.75 )- ( -4*(9/4) = -9 )- ( -3*(3/2) = -4.5 )- ( -12 )Adding them up: 6.75 - 9 - 4.5 - 12 = 6.75 - 25.5 = -18.75 ≠ 0Not a root either.Hmm, maybe ( x = -2 ):( 2(-8) - 4(4) - 3(-2) - 12 = -16 - 16 + 6 - 12 = -48 ≠ 0 )Nope.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check ( x = 3 ):( 2(27) = 54 )( -4(9) = -36 )( -3(3) = -9 )( -12 )So 54 - 36 = 18; 18 - 9 = 9; 9 - 12 = -3. Yeah, that's correct.Hmm, maybe I need to try another approach. Since none of the simple rational roots are working, perhaps I need to use synthetic division or factor by grouping.Looking at the equation again: ( 2x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x - 12 = 0 )Let me try to factor by grouping. Let's group the first two terms and the last two terms:( (2x^3 - 4x^2) + (-3x - 12) = 0 )Factor out common terms:From the first group: ( 2x^2(x - 2) )From the second group: ( -3(x + 4) )So, we have:( 2x^2(x - 2) - 3(x + 4) = 0 )Hmm, that doesn't seem to factor further because the terms inside the parentheses aren't the same. Maybe this isn't the right way to group.Alternatively, let me try a different grouping:( (2x^3 - 3x) + (-4x^2 - 12) = 0 )Factor:From the first group: ( x(2x^2 - 3) )From the second group: ( -4(x^2 + 3) )So, ( x(2x^2 - 3) - 4(x^2 + 3) = 0 )Still, not helpful because the terms inside are different.Maybe I need to use the cubic formula or numerical methods, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can graph the function or use the Intermediate Value Theorem to approximate the roots.Wait, another thought: Maybe I made a mistake earlier when subtracting ( Q(x) ) from ( P(x) ). Let me double-check that step.Original equation: ( P(x) = Q(x) )So, ( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 = -x^2 + 6x + 8 )Subtracting ( Q(x) ): ( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 - (-x^2 + 6x + 8) = 0 )Which becomes: ( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 + x^2 - 6x - 8 = 0 )Combine like terms:- ( x^3 ): 2x^3- ( x^2 ): -5x^2 + x^2 = -4x^2- ( x ): 3x - 6x = -3x- Constants: -4 -8 = -12So, the equation is indeed ( 2x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x - 12 = 0 ). Okay, so no mistake there.Since factoring isn't straightforward, maybe I can use the method of trial and error to approximate a root or use synthetic division.Alternatively, I can use the derivative to analyze the function's behavior.Let me compute the derivative of ( f(x) = 2x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x - 12 ):( f'(x) = 6x^2 - 8x - 3 )Set derivative to zero to find critical points:( 6x^2 - 8x - 3 = 0 )Using quadratic formula:( x = [8 ± sqrt(64 + 72)] / 12 = [8 ± sqrt(136)] / 12 = [8 ± 2*sqrt(34)] / 12 = [4 ± sqrt(34)] / 6 )Approximately, sqrt(34) is about 5.830, so:x ≈ (4 + 5.830)/6 ≈ 9.830/6 ≈ 1.638x ≈ (4 - 5.830)/6 ≈ (-1.830)/6 ≈ -0.305So, critical points at x ≈ 1.638 and x ≈ -0.305.Since we're dealing with years, x must be positive, so the relevant critical point is at x ≈ 1.638.Now, let's analyze the behavior of f(x):- As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity because the leading term is 2x^3.- As x approaches positive infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity.- At x = 0, f(0) = -12- At x = 1, f(1) = 2 - 4 - 3 - 12 = -17- At x = 2, f(2) = 16 - 16 - 6 - 12 = -18- At x = 3, f(3) = 54 - 36 - 9 - 12 = -3- At x = 4, f(4) = 128 - 64 - 12 - 12 = 40So, f(x) is increasing from x ≈ 1.638 onwards because the derivative is positive beyond that point.Looking at the values:- At x=3, f(3) = -3- At x=4, f(4)=40So, between x=3 and x=4, f(x) crosses from negative to positive, meaning there's a root between 3 and 4.Similarly, let's check between x=2 and x=3:At x=2, f(2)=-18; at x=3, f(3)=-3. Still negative, so no root there.Between x=1 and x=2, f(x) goes from -17 to -18, still negative.Between x=0 and x=1, f(x) goes from -12 to -17, still negative.So, the only real root is between x=3 and x=4.To approximate it, let's use the Intermediate Value Theorem.Compute f(3) = -3 and f(4)=40.Let me try x=3.5:f(3.5) = 2*(3.5)^3 - 4*(3.5)^2 - 3*(3.5) -12Calculate each term:- ( 3.5^3 = 42.875 ), so 2*42.875 = 85.75- ( 3.5^2 = 12.25 ), so -4*12.25 = -49- -3*3.5 = -10.5- -12Adding them up: 85.75 - 49 = 36.75; 36.75 -10.5 = 26.25; 26.25 -12 = 14.25So, f(3.5)=14.25Since f(3)=-3 and f(3.5)=14.25, the root is between 3 and 3.5.Let's try x=3.25:f(3.25) = 2*(3.25)^3 -4*(3.25)^2 -3*(3.25) -12Compute each term:- ( 3.25^3 = 34.328125 ), so 2*34.328125 ≈ 68.65625- ( 3.25^2 = 10.5625 ), so -4*10.5625 ≈ -42.25- -3*3.25 = -9.75- -12Adding them up: 68.65625 -42.25 ≈ 26.40625; 26.40625 -9.75 ≈ 16.65625; 16.65625 -12 ≈ 4.65625So, f(3.25)≈4.656Still positive. So the root is between 3 and 3.25.Let's try x=3.1:f(3.1) = 2*(29.791) -4*(9.61) -9.3 -12Wait, let me compute step by step:- ( 3.1^3 = 29.791 ), so 2*29.791 ≈59.582- ( 3.1^2 = 9.61 ), so -4*9.61 ≈-38.44- -3*3.1 = -9.3- -12Adding up: 59.582 -38.44 ≈21.142; 21.142 -9.3 ≈11.842; 11.842 -12 ≈-0.158So, f(3.1)≈-0.158That's very close to zero. So, between x=3.1 and x=3.25, f(x) crosses from negative to positive.Let me try x=3.125:f(3.125) = 2*(3.125)^3 -4*(3.125)^2 -3*(3.125) -12Compute each term:- ( 3.125^3 = 30.517578125 ), so 2*30.517578125 ≈61.03515625- ( 3.125^2 = 9.765625 ), so -4*9.765625 ≈-39.0625- -3*3.125 = -9.375- -12Adding up: 61.03515625 -39.0625 ≈21.97265625; 21.97265625 -9.375 ≈12.59765625; 12.59765625 -12 ≈0.59765625So, f(3.125)≈0.5977So, f(3.1)≈-0.158 and f(3.125)≈0.5977Therefore, the root is between 3.1 and 3.125.Let me use linear approximation between these two points.The change in x is 0.025, and the change in f(x) is from -0.158 to 0.5977, which is a change of approximately 0.7557.We need to find the x where f(x)=0. Let’s denote x1=3.1, f(x1)=-0.158; x2=3.125, f(x2)=0.5977The linear approximation formula is:x = x1 - f(x1)*(x2 - x1)/(f(x2) - f(x1))Plugging in the numbers:x = 3.1 - (-0.158)*(0.025)/(0.5977 - (-0.158)) = 3.1 + 0.158*0.025/(0.7557)Calculate denominator: 0.7557Calculate numerator: 0.158*0.025=0.00395So, x ≈3.1 + 0.00395/0.7557 ≈3.1 + 0.00523 ≈3.1052So, approximately x≈3.105 years.To check, let's compute f(3.105):f(3.105)=2*(3.105)^3 -4*(3.105)^2 -3*(3.105) -12First, compute 3.105^3:3.105^3 ≈3.105*3.105*3.105First, 3.105*3.105 ≈9.641Then, 9.641*3.105 ≈29.914So, 2*29.914≈59.828Next, 3.105^2≈9.641-4*9.641≈-38.564-3*3.105≈-9.315-12Adding up: 59.828 -38.564≈21.264; 21.264 -9.315≈11.949; 11.949 -12≈-0.051Hmm, so f(3.105)≈-0.051Still slightly negative. Let's try x=3.1075f(3.1075)=2*(3.1075)^3 -4*(3.1075)^2 -3*(3.1075) -12Compute 3.1075^3:Approximately, since 3.105^3≈29.914, 3.1075 is slightly larger.Let me compute 3.1075^3:First, 3.1075^2= (3.105 + 0.0025)^2 ≈3.105^2 + 2*3.105*0.0025 + (0.0025)^2≈9.641 + 0.015525 + 0.000006≈9.656531Then, 3.1075^3=3.1075*9.656531≈3*9.656531 + 0.1075*9.656531≈28.969593 + 1.038≈29.9996So, 2*29.9996≈59.9992Next, 3.1075^2≈9.656531-4*9.656531≈-38.6261-3*3.1075≈-9.3225-12Adding up: 59.9992 -38.6261≈21.3731; 21.3731 -9.3225≈12.0506; 12.0506 -12≈0.0506So, f(3.1075)≈0.0506So, f(3.105)≈-0.051 and f(3.1075)≈0.0506Therefore, the root is between 3.105 and 3.1075.Using linear approximation again:x1=3.105, f(x1)=-0.051x2=3.1075, f(x2)=0.0506We want f(x)=0.Slope= (0.0506 - (-0.051))/(3.1075 - 3.105)= (0.1016)/0.0025≈40.64So, x= x1 - f(x1)/slope= 3.105 - (-0.051)/40.64≈3.105 + 0.001255≈3.106255So, approximately x≈3.1063 years.To check, compute f(3.1063):But this is getting too precise. For the purposes of this problem, maybe we can accept that the root is approximately 3.106 years.But since we're dealing with years, it's probably acceptable to round to two decimal places, so x≈3.11 years.However, since the problem is about years, it's more practical to consider integer values. But the equation suggests that the profits are equal at approximately 3.11 years. So, the answer is x≈3.11.But wait, let me think again. Since the equation is a cubic, it can have up to three real roots. But from our earlier analysis, we saw that f(x) only crosses zero once between x=3 and x=4. The other roots are either complex or negative, which don't make sense in this context since x represents years.So, the only relevant solution is x≈3.11 years.But let me confirm if there are any other positive roots.Wait, when I tested x= -0.305, which is a critical point, but since x can't be negative, we can ignore that.So, conclusion: The profits are equal at approximately x≈3.11 years.But to be precise, maybe I can use the Newton-Raphson method for better approximation.Starting with x0=3.1f(3.1)= -0.158f'(x)=6x^2 -8x -3f'(3.1)=6*(9.61) -8*(3.1) -3=57.66 -24.8 -3=29.86Next iteration:x1= x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0)=3.1 - (-0.158)/29.86≈3.1 +0.00529≈3.10529Compute f(3.10529):As before, approximately -0.051f'(3.10529)=6*(3.10529)^2 -8*(3.10529) -3Compute 3.10529^2≈9.641So, f'(3.10529)=6*9.641 -8*3.10529 -3≈57.846 -24.842 -3≈29.999≈30So, x2= x1 - f(x1)/f'(x1)=3.10529 - (-0.051)/30≈3.10529 +0.0017≈3.10699Compute f(3.10699):Approximately, f(3.107)=0.0506 as before, but let's do a better estimate.Wait, actually, 3.10699 is very close to 3.107, which we saw gives f(x)=0.0506.But since f(3.10699) is slightly less than 3.107, maybe it's around 0.05.Wait, perhaps I should compute f(3.10699):But this is getting too detailed. For the purposes of this problem, I think it's sufficient to say that the root is approximately 3.11 years.So, the first company's profit equals the second company's profit at approximately x≈3.11 years.Now, moving on to the second part: Determine the interval of years where the first company's profit exceeds the second company's profit, i.e., solve the inequality ( P(x) > Q(x) ).From the first part, we know that ( P(x) - Q(x) = 2x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x - 12 ). We found that this equals zero at x≈3.11.Since this is a cubic equation with a positive leading coefficient, the graph will go from negative infinity to positive infinity. We know that for x < 3.11, the function ( P(x) - Q(x) ) is negative (since at x=0, it's -12, and it only crosses zero at x≈3.11). After x≈3.11, the function becomes positive.But wait, let me confirm the behavior:- For x approaching negative infinity, the function tends to negative infinity.- At x=0, f(0)=-12- At x=1, f(1)=-17- At x=2, f(2)=-18- At x=3, f(3)=-3- At x=4, f(4)=40So, the function is negative before x≈3.11 and positive after that.Therefore, the inequality ( P(x) > Q(x) ) holds when ( 2x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x - 12 > 0 ), which is when x > 3.11.But wait, let me think again. Since it's a cubic, after x≈3.11, it goes to positive infinity, so yes, it's positive beyond that point.However, we should also consider the behavior between the critical points. Earlier, we found a critical point at x≈1.638. Let me check the sign of f(x) around that point.Wait, at x=1.638, which is a local minimum or maximum?From the derivative, f'(x)=6x^2 -8x -3.At x≈1.638, which is the critical point, let's see if it's a minima or maxima.Since the derivative changes from negative to positive at x≈1.638, it's a local minima.Wait, actually, let me compute the second derivative:f''(x)=12x -8At x≈1.638, f''(x)=12*1.638 -8≈19.656 -8≈11.656>0, so it's a local minima.So, at x≈1.638, f(x) has a local minima. Let's compute f(1.638):f(1.638)=2*(1.638)^3 -4*(1.638)^2 -3*(1.638) -12Compute each term:- ( 1.638^3 ≈4.394 ), so 2*4.394≈8.788- ( 1.638^2≈2.683 ), so -4*2.683≈-10.732- -3*1.638≈-4.914- -12Adding up: 8.788 -10.732≈-1.944; -1.944 -4.914≈-6.858; -6.858 -12≈-18.858So, f(1.638)≈-18.858So, the function has a local minima at x≈1.638, f(x)≈-18.858, which is still negative.Therefore, the function is negative before x≈3.11 and positive after that.Hence, the inequality ( P(x) > Q(x) ) holds for x > 3.11.But wait, let me confirm by testing a value greater than 3.11, say x=4, where f(4)=40>0, which is correct.And a value less than 3.11, say x=3, f(3)=-3<0, which is correct.Therefore, the first company's profit exceeds the second company's profit when x > approximately 3.11 years.But since we're dealing with years, it's practical to consider x as a continuous variable, so the interval is (3.11, ∞).However, in the context of the problem, we might need to express this in terms of intervals where x is greater than 3.11.But let me also consider if there are any other intervals where P(x) > Q(x). Since the cubic only crosses zero once, and it's negative before that and positive after, there are no other intervals.Therefore, the answer to part 2 is that the first company's profit exceeds the second's for x > approximately 3.11 years.But to express this precisely, we can write it as x > 3.11, or in interval notation, (3.11, ∞).However, since the problem might expect an exact answer, but since the root is irrational, we can express it as x > (the real root of the equation 2x^3 -4x^2 -3x -12=0), but in the context of the problem, it's acceptable to use the approximate value.Alternatively, if we can factor the cubic, but earlier attempts didn't yield a rational root, so it's likely that the root is irrational.Therefore, summarizing:1. The profits are equal at approximately x≈3.11 years.2. The first company's profit exceeds the second's for x > 3.11 years.But to be thorough, let me check if there are any other points where P(x) might cross Q(x) again. Since it's a cubic, it can have up to three real roots, but in this case, we've only found one positive real root. The other roots are either complex or negative, which don't apply here.Therefore, the only relevant solution is x≈3.11.So, final answers:1. The profits are equal at approximately 3.11 years.2. The first company's profit exceeds the second's for x > 3.11 years.But to express this more precisely, maybe we can write the exact form of the root, but since it's a cubic, it's complicated. Alternatively, we can leave it as an approximate decimal.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact answer, but given the cubic, it's unlikely. So, I think the approximate decimal is acceptable.Therefore, the answers are:1. x≈3.11 years2. x > 3.11 yearsBut to express this in the required format, I think I should present the exact form if possible, but since it's not a nice number, I'll go with the approximate.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me double-check the equation.Original equation: P(x)=Q(x)So, 2x³ -5x² +3x -4 = -x² +6x +8Subtracting Q(x):2x³ -5x² +3x -4 +x² -6x -8=0Simplify:2x³ -4x² -3x -12=0Yes, that's correct.So, no mistake there.Therefore, the conclusion stands.**Final Answer**1. The profits are equal after approximately boxed{3.11} years.2. The first company's profit exceeds the second's for all years after approximately boxed{3.11} years."},{"question":"As an electronics engineer passionate about technology, you decide to help your family members update their home with the latest smart devices. You plan to install a smart thermostat and smart lighting system. The smart thermostat costs T, and each smart light bulb costs L. You estimate that installing the thermostat will save your family a total of 50 per month on energy bills, while each smart light bulb saves 5 per month. 1. If the total cost for installing the thermostat and 10 smart light bulbs is 500, express this situation as an equation in terms of T and L.2. Your goal is to break even on your investment in one year through energy savings. Formulate an inequality to determine the maximum combined cost of the thermostat and 10 smart light bulbs that allows you to achieve this goal.","answer":"First, I need to express the total cost of installing the smart thermostat and 10 smart light bulbs as an equation. The thermostat costs T dollars and each light bulb costs L dollars. Therefore, the total cost is T plus 10 times L, which equals 500 dollars.Next, to determine the maximum combined cost that allows breaking even in one year, I'll calculate the total energy savings. The thermostat saves 50 per month, and each light bulb saves 5 per month. With 10 light bulbs, the monthly savings from the bulbs are 10 times 5, which is 50. So, the total monthly savings from both the thermostat and the bulbs is 50 plus 50, totaling 100 per month.Over one year, the total savings would be 12 times 100, which equals 1,200. To break even, the total cost of the devices should be less than or equal to the total savings. Therefore, the combined cost of the thermostat and 10 light bulbs must be less than or equal to 1,200."},{"question":"A Japanese game developer is creating a new video game inspired by classic Japanese games. In one of the game levels, the player must solve a puzzle to unlock a hidden area. The puzzle involves aligning a series of gears, where the rotation of each gear is controlled by a polynomial function representing its angular position over time. The polynomial equation for gear A is ( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ).1. Solve for ( x ) when ( f(x) = 0 ) to determine the critical points where gear A aligns perfectly in the puzzle.Additionally, the game developer wants to incorporate a feature that opens a secret passage if the player inputs the correct sequence of numerical codes related to the history of Japanese video games. This sequence can be represented by the inequality ( 4x - 7 leq 3x + 5 ).2. Solve the inequality for ( x ) to find the range of valid numbers that can be used as input for unlocking the secret passage.","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about a video game puzzle involving gears and polynomial functions. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says that gear A has a polynomial equation ( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ). I need to solve for ( x ) when ( f(x) = 0 ). That means I have to find the roots of this cubic equation. Hmm, cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor it.Let me write down the equation again: ( x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 ). I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can help find possible rational roots. The possible roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -6, and the leading coefficient is 1. So the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.Let me test these one by one. I'll start with x=1. Plugging into the equation: ( 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0 ). That adds up to 0. So, x=1 is a root. Great, that means (x - 1) is a factor.Now, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 1). Let me use synthetic division because it's quicker. Setting up for x=1:1 | 1  -6  11  -6        1  -5   6      1  -5   6   0So after division, the polynomial becomes ( (x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6) ). Now, I can factor the quadratic part: ( x^2 - 5x + 6 ). Looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. That would be -2 and -3. So, it factors to ( (x - 2)(x - 3) ).Putting it all together, the polynomial factors to ( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) ). Therefore, the roots are x=1, x=2, and x=3. So, the critical points where gear A aligns perfectly are at x=1, x=2, and x=3.Alright, that was part one. Now, moving on to part two. The game developer wants a sequence of numbers related to the history of Japanese video games, represented by the inequality ( 4x - 7 leq 3x + 5 ). I need to solve this inequality for x.Let me write it down: ( 4x - 7 leq 3x + 5 ). To solve for x, I should get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Subtract 3x from both sides: ( 4x - 3x - 7 leq 5 ). That simplifies to ( x - 7 leq 5 ). Now, add 7 to both sides: ( x leq 12 ).Wait, let me double-check. Starting again: ( 4x - 7 leq 3x + 5 ). Subtract 3x: ( x - 7 leq 5 ). Add 7: ( x leq 12 ). Yep, that seems right. So, the solution is all real numbers x such that x is less than or equal to 12.But wait, is there any restriction on x? The problem doesn't specify, so I think x can be any real number up to 12. So, the range of valid numbers is from negative infinity up to 12.Hmm, but in the context of the game, maybe x has to be a positive integer or something? The problem doesn't specify, so I think I should stick with the mathematical solution, which is ( x leq 12 ).So, summarizing my findings: for the first part, the critical points are x=1, 2, 3. For the second part, the valid inputs are all numbers less than or equal to 12.**Final Answer**1. The critical points are boxed{1}, boxed{2}, and boxed{3}.2.

You notice that the number of comments (C) on your posts can be modeled by the quadratic equation ( C(t) = -2t^2 + 12t + 20 ), where ( t ) represents the time in hours after a major Manchester United match ends.1. Determine the time ( t ) at which the number of comments reaches its maximum value. Then, calculate the maximum number of comments.2. Additionally, you are planning a new post strategy to increase engagement. You aim to have at least 40 comments per post. Find the range of times ( t ) after a match for which your posts receive at least 40 comments.","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to help this social media influencer figure out when their posts about Manchester United get the most comments. They've given me this quadratic equation: ( C(t) = -2t^2 + 12t + 20 ). I remember that quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of this parabola is going to be the maximum point, which in this case is the maximum number of comments.First, I need to find the time ( t ) at which the number of comments is maximized. I recall that for a quadratic equation in the form ( at^2 + bt + c ), the vertex occurs at ( t = -frac{b}{2a} ). So, plugging in the values from the equation, ( a = -2 ) and ( b = 12 ). Calculating that, ( t = -frac{12}{2*(-2)} = -frac{12}{-4} = 3 ). So, the maximum number of comments occurs 3 hours after the match ends. Now, to find the maximum number of comments, I substitute ( t = 3 ) back into the equation. ( C(3) = -2*(3)^2 + 12*3 + 20 ). Let me compute that step by step. First, ( (3)^2 = 9 ), so ( -2*9 = -18 ). Then, ( 12*3 = 36 ). Adding those together with the constant term: ( -18 + 36 + 20 ). Calculating that: ( -18 + 36 = 18 ), and ( 18 + 20 = 38 ). So, the maximum number of comments is 38.Wait, hold on. That seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations. ( C(3) = -2*(9) + 36 + 20 ). So, ( -18 + 36 = 18 ), and ( 18 + 20 = 38 ). Hmm, that's correct. Maybe the model is just predicting 38 as the peak. Okay, moving on.Next, the influencer wants to know the range of times ( t ) where the number of comments is at least 40. So, we need to solve the inequality ( -2t^2 + 12t + 20 geq 40 ).Let me write that down: ( -2t^2 + 12t + 20 geq 40 ). To solve this, I'll subtract 40 from both sides to get the quadratic on one side:( -2t^2 + 12t + 20 - 40 geq 0 )Simplifying that, ( -2t^2 + 12t - 20 geq 0 ).Hmm, this is a quadratic inequality. Since the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is negative, the parabola opens downward. So, the expression ( -2t^2 + 12t - 20 ) will be above zero between its two roots.To find the roots, I can set the equation equal to zero:( -2t^2 + 12t - 20 = 0 )I can multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:( 2t^2 - 12t + 20 = 0 )Now, let's see if I can factor this or if I need to use the quadratic formula. The discriminant ( D = b^2 - 4ac = (-12)^2 - 4*2*20 = 144 - 160 = -16 ). Wait, the discriminant is negative, which means there are no real roots. But that can't be right because earlier, when I calculated the maximum at t=3, the number of comments was 38, which is less than 40. So, if the maximum is 38, the number of comments never reaches 40. Therefore, there are no real solutions, meaning the number of comments never gets to 40 or above.But wait, let me check my steps again because this seems conflicting. Starting from the inequality: ( -2t^2 + 12t + 20 geq 40 )Subtract 40: ( -2t^2 + 12t - 20 geq 0 )Multiply by -1 (and reverse inequality): ( 2t^2 - 12t + 20 leq 0 )Now, discriminant: ( D = (-12)^2 - 4*2*20 = 144 - 160 = -16 ). Still negative.So, since the quadratic ( 2t^2 - 12t + 20 ) is always positive (since the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is positive and no real roots), the inequality ( 2t^2 - 12t + 20 leq 0 ) has no solution. Therefore, the original inequality ( -2t^2 + 12t + 20 geq 40 ) also has no solution.This means that the number of comments never reaches 40 or more. The maximum is 38, so it's impossible to have 40 comments. Therefore, there is no time ( t ) where the number of comments is at least 40.Wait, but the influencer is planning a new strategy to increase engagement, aiming for at least 40 comments. If the model shows the maximum is 38, maybe they need to adjust their strategy or the model is not accurate. But based on the given equation, the maximum is indeed 38, so they can't reach 40.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the maximum. Let me check again.( C(t) = -2t^2 + 12t + 20 )Vertex at ( t = -b/(2a) = -12/(2*(-2)) = 3 ). Correct.( C(3) = -2*(9) + 36 + 20 = -18 + 36 + 20 = 38 ). Correct.So, yes, the maximum is 38, which is less than 40. Therefore, the influencer cannot achieve 40 comments based on this model. So, the range of times ( t ) where comments are at least 40 is empty.But maybe I should present it as no solution or an empty set.Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the inequality. Let me try solving it again.Original inequality: ( -2t^2 + 12t + 20 geq 40 )Bring 40 to the left: ( -2t^2 + 12t + 20 - 40 geq 0 ) → ( -2t^2 + 12t - 20 geq 0 )Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality flips): ( 2t^2 - 12t + 20 leq 0 )Since the quadratic ( 2t^2 - 12t + 20 ) has a discriminant of -16, which is negative, it never crosses zero. The quadratic is always positive because the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is positive. Therefore, ( 2t^2 - 12t + 20 leq 0 ) has no solution. Hence, the original inequality has no solution.Therefore, the influencer cannot achieve 40 comments at any time ( t ) based on this model.Wait, but maybe I should consider if the model is accurate or if there's a mistake in the equation. But since the problem states the model is ( C(t) = -2t^2 + 12t + 20 ), I have to go with that.So, summarizing:1. The maximum number of comments occurs at ( t = 3 ) hours, with 38 comments.2. There is no time ( t ) where the number of comments is at least 40 because the maximum is only 38.But the influencer is planning a strategy to have at least 40 comments, so maybe they need to adjust their model or strategy beyond what this equation predicts.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check one more time.Calculating ( C(3) ):( -2*(3)^2 + 12*3 + 20 = -2*9 + 36 + 20 = -18 + 36 + 20 = 38 ). Correct.So, yes, the maximum is indeed 38. Therefore, the answer for part 2 is that there is no such time ( t ) where comments are at least 40.Alternatively, if the influencer wants to have at least 40 comments, they might need to adjust their model or perhaps the equation is different.

Let me take it step by step.First, the problem mentions a polynomial model for the expected number of attendees, A(x) = -2x² + 12x + 20, where x is the funding in hundreds of dollars. I need to find the amount of funding that will maximize the number of attendees. Hmm, okay, so this is a quadratic equation, and since the coefficient of x² is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola will give me the maximum point. So, I need to find the vertex of this quadratic function.I remember that for a quadratic function in the form A(x) = ax² + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by -b/(2a). Let me apply that here. In this case, a is -2 and b is 12. So, plugging into the formula, x = -12/(2*(-2)) = -12/(-4) = 3. So, x is 3. Since x is in hundreds of dollars, that would be 300. So, the funding needed to maximize the number of attendees is 300.Wait, let me double-check that. If I plug x = 3 into A(x), I should get the maximum number of attendees. Let's calculate A(3): -2*(3)² + 12*3 + 20 = -2*9 + 36 + 20 = -18 + 36 + 20 = 38. Okay, so 38 attendees. If I try x = 2, A(2) = -8 + 24 + 20 = 36. And x = 4, A(4) = -32 + 48 + 20 = 36. So, yes, x = 3 gives the maximum. That seems right.Alright, moving on to the second part. The tribal council has a budget constraint represented by the inequality 3x + y ≤ 45, where y is additional costs for facilities and amenities, also in hundreds of dollars. They've decided to allocate exactly 600, which is x = 6. I need to find the maximum possible y without exceeding the budget.So, substituting x = 6 into the inequality: 3*6 + y ≤ 45. Let's compute 3*6, which is 18. So, 18 + y ≤ 45. To find y, subtract 18 from both sides: y ≤ 45 - 18, which is y ≤ 27. So, the maximum possible additional cost y is 27, which is 2700.Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I interpreted the budget constraint correctly. The inequality is 3x + y ≤ 45, where x is funding in hundreds and y is additional costs in hundreds. So, x = 6 is 600, and y would be in hundreds as well. So, y ≤ 27 means 2700. That seems correct.But just to double-check, if x is 6, then 3x is 18, and 18 + y must be less than or equal to 45. So, y can be up to 27. So, yes, that's 2700. That seems like a lot, but given that the budget is 45 in hundreds, which is 4500, and they're allocating 600 to funding, the remaining is 3900, but wait, 45 - 18 is 27, which is 2700. Hmm, so that's correct because 3x is 18, so y is 27. So, 18 + 27 = 45, which is exactly the budget. So, that makes sense.Just to recap, for the first part, the maximum number of attendees occurs at x = 3, which is 300. For the second part, when x is 6, y can be up to 27, which is 2700. So, I think I've got both parts figured out.**Final Answer**1. The funding needed to maximize attendance is boxed{3} hundred dollars.2. The maximum additional costs are boxed{27} hundred dollars."},{"question":"A cognitive scientist is modeling the process of immersion in fictional worlds using a polynomial function. The function ( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ) represents the level of immersion, where ( x ) represents the time (in hours) spent engaging with the fictional world. The scientist is interested in finding the points in time when the level of immersion is at its highest, lowest, or achieves equilibrium (when immersion doesn't change over time).1. Solve the polynomial equation ( f(x) = 0 ) to find the times when the level of immersion reaches an equilibrium state.2. The scientist also hypothesizes that after 2 hours, the level of immersion increases at a constant rate. Determine the rate of change of immersion after 2 hours by finding the derivative of the function at that point, ( f'(2) ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where a cognitive scientist is using a polynomial function to model the level of immersion in a fictional world. The function given is ( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ), where ( x ) represents time in hours. The scientist wants to find the points in time when the immersion is at its highest, lowest, or in equilibrium. First, the problem asks me to solve the polynomial equation ( f(x) = 0 ) to find the times when the level of immersion reaches an equilibrium state. Hmm, okay. So, equilibrium here probably means when the immersion isn't changing—it's at a steady level. In calculus terms, that would be when the derivative of the function is zero because the slope is flat there. But wait, the question specifically says to solve ( f(x) = 0 ). So maybe equilibrium here is when the immersion level itself is zero? That might make sense if zero represents a baseline or no immersion. But let me think again. Equilibrium in the context of immersion could mean a point where the rate of change is zero, meaning it's either a maximum, minimum, or a saddle point. So, that would be the critical points found by setting the derivative equal to zero. However, the question explicitly says to solve ( f(x) = 0 ), so maybe they're referring to when the immersion level is zero, which could be considered equilibrium points as well. Wait, maybe I should clarify. If equilibrium means the immersion isn't changing, that's the derivative. But if it's just a state where immersion is zero, that's the function itself. The question says \\"when the level of immersion reaches an equilibrium state.\\" Hmm. So, maybe equilibrium here is when the immersion is neither increasing nor decreasing, which would be the critical points. But the question says to solve ( f(x) = 0 ), so maybe it's referring to when the immersion level is zero, which could be considered an equilibrium in the sense of no immersion. I think I need to proceed with solving ( f(x) = 0 ) as the question instructs. So, let's factor the polynomial ( x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ). Maybe it factors nicely. Let me try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term over factors of the leading coefficient. So, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.Let me test x=1: ( 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0 ). Yes, 1 is a root. So, (x - 1) is a factor. Now, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.Using synthetic division with root 1:1 | 1  -6  11  -6Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by 1: 1, add to -6: -5Multiply 1 by -5: -5, add to 11: 6Multiply 1 by 6: 6, add to -6: 0So, the polynomial factors to (x - 1)(x² - 5x + 6). Now, factor the quadratic: x² -5x +6. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5. Those are -2 and -3. So, it factors to (x - 2)(x - 3). Therefore, the polynomial factors completely as (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3). So, the roots are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3. So, the times when the level of immersion reaches equilibrium are at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours. But wait, earlier I was confused about whether equilibrium refers to f(x)=0 or f'(x)=0. Since the question says \\"solve f(x)=0\\", I think it's correct to say that the equilibrium points are at x=1,2,3. But just to make sure, maybe I should also check the critical points by finding f'(x) and setting it to zero. So, f'(x) is the derivative of f(x). Let's compute that: f'(x) = 3x² - 12x + 11. To find critical points, set f'(x)=0: 3x² -12x +11=0. Let's solve this quadratic equation. Using the quadratic formula: x = [12 ± sqrt(144 - 132)] / 6 = [12 ± sqrt(12)] /6 = [12 ± 2*sqrt(3)] /6 = [6 ± sqrt(3)] /3 = 2 ± (sqrt(3)/3). So, approximately, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/3 is about 0.577. So, the critical points are at approximately 2.577 and 1.423 hours. So, these are the points where the immersion is at a local maximum or minimum. So, these are the points of highest or lowest immersion. But the question specifically asked for equilibrium when f(x)=0, so I think the answer is x=1,2,3. Moving on to the second part: The scientist hypothesizes that after 2 hours, the level of immersion increases at a constant rate. Determine the rate of change of immersion after 2 hours by finding the derivative of the function at that point, f'(2). So, we already found f'(x) = 3x² -12x +11. So, plug in x=2: f'(2) = 3*(4) -12*(2) +11 = 12 -24 +11 = (12 +11) -24 = 23 -24 = -1. Wait, that's negative. So, the rate of change after 2 hours is -1. That would mean the immersion is decreasing at a rate of 1 unit per hour. But the scientist hypothesizes that it increases at a constant rate. Hmm, so maybe the scientist is wrong? Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check. f'(x) = 3x² -12x +11. At x=2: 3*(4) =12; 12x=24; so 12 -24 +11= (12+11)=23-24=-1. Yeah, that's correct. So, the rate of change is -1, which is decreasing. So, the scientist's hypothesis might be incorrect, or perhaps the model shows that after 2 hours, the immersion is actually decreasing. But the question just asks to find f'(2), so regardless of the hypothesis, the rate is -1. So, summarizing: 1. The times when immersion is at equilibrium (f(x)=0) are x=1,2,3 hours. 2. The rate of change after 2 hours is -1. Wait, but the question says \\"after 2 hours\\", so is it at x=2 or just after? Hmm, in calculus, the derivative at a point gives the instantaneous rate of change at that exact moment. So, at x=2, the rate is -1. So, just after 2 hours, the rate is -1. So, the immersion is decreasing at a rate of 1 per hour. So, maybe the scientist's hypothesis is incorrect because the immersion is actually decreasing after 2 hours, not increasing. But the question just asks to find f'(2), so I think that's all that's needed. So, final answers: 1. x=1,2,3 2. f'(2)=-1 I think that's it.**Final Answer**1. The times when the level of immersion reaches equilibrium are boxed{1}, boxed{2}, and boxed{3} hours.2. The rate of change of immersion after 2 hours is boxed{-1}."},{"question":"A contemporary Brazilian filmmaker, inspired by the Cinema Novo movement, is working on a project that involves the use of both traditional film techniques and modern digital technology. In one scene, the filmmaker wants to create a visual effect that symbolizes the blend of old and new by projecting overlapping images of two different classic Brazilian films.1. The images are projected onto a screen that is shaped like a parabola. The equation of the screen is given by ( y = -x^2 + 4x ). To ensure the projection fits perfectly, the filmmaker wants to find the points where the image of the parabola intersects with the x-axis. Find these intersection points.2. Additionally, the filmmaker decides to use a digital filter that alters the brightness of the projected images based on the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). Determine the range of ( x )-values for which the brightness effect is applied on the screen.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a Brazilian filmmaker working on a project that combines traditional film techniques with modern digital technology. The problem has two parts, both involving some math with parabolas. Let me try to figure them out step by step.First, part 1: The screen is shaped like a parabola with the equation ( y = -x^2 + 4x ). The filmmaker wants to find the points where this parabola intersects the x-axis. Hmm, I remember that to find x-intercepts, I need to set ( y = 0 ) and solve for ( x ). So, let me write that down:( 0 = -x^2 + 4x )Hmm, this is a quadratic equation. I can rearrange it to make it easier to solve. Let me factor out an ( x ):( 0 = x(-x + 4) )So, setting each factor equal to zero gives me the solutions:1. ( x = 0 )2. ( -x + 4 = 0 ) => ( x = 4 )So, the parabola intersects the x-axis at ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 4 ). Therefore, the points are (0, 0) and (4, 0). That seems straightforward.Wait, let me double-check. If I plug ( x = 0 ) into the equation, ( y = -0 + 0 = 0 ). Correct. For ( x = 4 ), ( y = -(16) + 16 = 0 ). Yep, that works. So, part 1 seems done.Moving on to part 2: The filmmaker uses a digital filter based on the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). I need to determine the range of ( x )-values where this inequality holds true on the screen. So, essentially, I need to solve the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But wait, the screen itself is defined by ( y = -x^2 + 4x ). So, does this mean we're comparing the screen's equation to another quadratic?Let me write down the inequality:( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 )But since the screen is ( y = -x^2 + 4x ), I can substitute that into the inequality:( -x^2 + 4x < -x^2 + 4x - 3 )Wait, that seems a bit strange. Let me subtract ( -x^2 + 4x ) from both sides to see what happens:( 0 < -3 )Wait, that can't be right. 0 is not less than -3. So, does that mean the inequality is never true? That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.Let me read it again: \\"the brightness effect is applied on the screen based on the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ).\\" So, perhaps it's not substituting the screen's equation into the inequality, but rather, the brightness is applied where the screen's ( y ) is less than ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, the screen is ( y = -x^2 + 4x ), and the filter is applied where ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, substituting the screen's ( y ) into the inequality:( -x^2 + 4x < -x^2 + 4x - 3 )Again, subtracting ( -x^2 + 4x ) from both sides:( 0 < -3 )Which is still false. So, does that mean the brightness effect is never applied? That seems odd. Maybe I need to approach this differently.Alternatively, perhaps the inequality is meant to be compared to the screen's ( y ). So, the screen's ( y ) is ( -x^2 + 4x ), and the filter is applied where ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, the region where the screen's ( y ) is below the curve ( y = -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, maybe I need to find where ( -x^2 + 4x < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). Wait, that's the same as before, which simplifies to 0 < -3, which is never true. So, perhaps the brightness effect is never applied? That doesn't make sense either.Wait, maybe I misread the inequality. Let me check: it says ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, perhaps it's not substituting the screen's ( y ), but rather, the filter is applied where the screen's ( y ) is less than this other quadratic. So, maybe I need to solve for ( x ) where ( -x^2 + 4x < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But again, that simplifies to 0 < -3, which is always false. So, the brightness effect is never applied? That seems confusing.Wait, maybe I need to consider the screen's equation as the boundary, and the inequality is another boundary. Let me graph both equations to visualize.The screen is ( y = -x^2 + 4x ), which is a downward opening parabola with vertex at (2, 4). The other equation is ( y = -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), which is also a downward opening parabola, but shifted down by 3 units. So, it's the same shape but lower.So, the screen's parabola is above the other parabola everywhere because it's shifted up by 3 units. Therefore, the region where ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) would be below the lower parabola. But since the screen is above that, does that mean the brightness effect is never applied on the screen? That seems possible, but maybe I'm missing something.Alternatively, perhaps the inequality is meant to be ( y < (-x^2 + 4x) - 3 ), which is the same as ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, maybe it's asking where on the screen (which is ( y = -x^2 + 4x )) is the brightness applied, which is where the screen's ( y ) is less than ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But as we saw, that's never true because ( -x^2 + 4x ) is always 3 units above ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, the brightness effect is never applied? That seems odd, but maybe that's the case.Alternatively, perhaps the inequality is supposed to be ( y < (-x^2 + 4x) - 3 ), which is the same as ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, maybe the brightness is applied where the screen's ( y ) is less than that. But since the screen's ( y ) is always 3 units higher, it's never less. So, the range of ( x ) is empty? That is, there are no ( x )-values where the brightness effect is applied.But that seems counterintuitive. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the inequality. Let me think again.Wait, perhaps the inequality is not comparing the screen's ( y ) to another function, but rather, it's a separate condition. So, the brightness is applied where ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But since the screen is defined by ( y = -x^2 + 4x ), the brightness is applied where the screen's ( y ) is less than ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But as we saw, that's impossible because ( -x^2 + 4x ) is always 3 units above ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, the brightness is never applied.Alternatively, maybe the inequality is meant to be ( y < (-x^2 + 4x) - 3 ), but that's the same as before. Hmm.Wait, maybe I need to consider the region where the screen's ( y ) is less than ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But since the screen is ( y = -x^2 + 4x ), which is always 3 units above ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) would never be true on the screen. So, the brightness effect is never applied. Therefore, the range of ( x )-values is empty.But that seems a bit strange. Maybe I should consider solving the inequality ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ) to find where the brightness is applied. Wait, no, the inequality is ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), so we need to find where the screen's ( y ) is less than that. But since the screen's ( y ) is always higher, it's never less. So, the answer is no solution.Alternatively, maybe I need to solve ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ) to find where the brightness is applied. Let me try that.So, solving ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ). Let's factor this quadratic.First, multiply both sides by -1 (remembering to reverse the inequality):( x^2 - 4x + 3 < 0 )Now, factor the quadratic:( (x - 1)(x - 3) < 0 )So, the critical points are at ( x = 1 ) and ( x = 3 ). Testing intervals:1. For ( x < 1 ), say ( x = 0 ): ( (0 - 1)(0 - 3) = (-1)(-3) = 3 > 0 )2. For ( 1 < x < 3 ), say ( x = 2 ): ( (2 - 1)(2 - 3) = (1)(-1) = -1 < 0 )3. For ( x > 3 ), say ( x = 4 ): ( (4 - 1)(4 - 3) = (3)(1) = 3 > 0 )So, the inequality ( (x - 1)(x - 3) < 0 ) holds for ( 1 < x < 3 ). Therefore, the original inequality ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ) holds for ( 1 < x < 3 ).Wait, but the original inequality was ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, if ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), then ( y < ) something positive. But the screen's ( y ) is ( -x^2 + 4x ), which is a downward opening parabola. So, maybe the brightness is applied where the screen's ( y ) is below the line ( y = -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), but since the screen's ( y ) is always above that, it's never applied. However, if we consider the region where ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), which is between 1 and 3, maybe the brightness is applied there? I'm getting confused.Wait, perhaps the brightness effect is applied where the screen's ( y ) is less than ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But since the screen's ( y ) is ( -x^2 + 4x ), which is always 3 units higher, it's never less. So, the brightness effect is never applied. Therefore, the range of ( x )-values is empty.But that seems contradictory because the problem says the filmmaker decides to use a digital filter that alters the brightness based on that inequality. So, maybe I'm missing something.Wait, perhaps the inequality is not in terms of ( y ), but in terms of another variable. Or maybe it's a different kind of filter. Alternatively, maybe the inequality is ( y < (-x^2 + 4x) - 3 ), which is the same as ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, we're looking for points on the screen where the ( y )-value is less than ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But since the screen's ( y ) is ( -x^2 + 4x ), which is always 3 units higher, the inequality is never true. So, the brightness effect is never applied.Alternatively, maybe the inequality is supposed to be ( y < (-x^2 + 4x) - 3 ), which is the same as ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, again, the same conclusion.Wait, maybe I need to consider the region where ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) is above the screen's ( y ). But since the screen's ( y ) is always above, that's not possible.Alternatively, perhaps the inequality is meant to be ( y < (-x^2 + 4x) - 3 ), but that's the same as before. Hmm.Wait, maybe I need to solve for ( x ) where ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), which we found is between 1 and 3. So, perhaps the brightness is applied where ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), which is between 1 and 3. But the problem says the brightness effect is applied where ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, if ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), then ( y < ) a positive number. But the screen's ( y ) is ( -x^2 + 4x ), which is also positive in that interval. So, is ( -x^2 + 4x < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) in that interval? No, because subtracting 3 makes it less. So, in the interval 1 < x < 3, ( -x^2 + 4x ) is positive, but ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) is also positive but less. So, the screen's ( y ) is greater than ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) in that interval, meaning the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) is not satisfied.Wait, I'm getting myself in circles. Let me try a different approach.Let me consider the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). Since the screen is ( y = -x^2 + 4x ), we can substitute that into the inequality:( -x^2 + 4x < -x^2 + 4x - 3 )Simplify both sides by adding ( x^2 - 4x ):( 0 < -3 )Which is false. So, the inequality is never true. Therefore, there are no ( x )-values where the brightness effect is applied. So, the range is empty.But that seems odd because the problem mentions the filmmaker decides to use this filter. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the inequality. Perhaps it's not comparing the screen's ( y ) to another function, but rather, it's a separate condition. So, the brightness is applied where ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), regardless of the screen's equation. So, we need to find the ( x )-values where ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But since the screen is defined by ( y = -x^2 + 4x ), the brightness is applied where the screen's ( y ) is less than ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But as we saw, that's never true. So, the brightness effect is never applied.Alternatively, maybe the inequality is meant to be ( y < (-x^2 + 4x) - 3 ), which is the same as ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, again, same conclusion.Wait, maybe I need to consider the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) without substituting the screen's equation. So, solving for ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). Since the screen is ( y = -x^2 + 4x ), the brightness is applied where the screen's ( y ) is below ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But since the screen's ( y ) is always above that, it's never applied.Alternatively, perhaps the inequality is meant to be ( y < (-x^2 + 4x) - 3 ), which is the same as ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, again, same conclusion.Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the range of ( x ) where ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), which we found is between 1 and 3. So, perhaps the brightness is applied where ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), which is between 1 and 3. But the problem says the brightness is applied where ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, if ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), then ( y < ) a positive number. But the screen's ( y ) is also positive in that interval, so it's possible that ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) is true in some parts of that interval.Wait, let's test a point in the interval 1 < x < 3. Let's take x = 2.Screen's y: ( -4 + 8 = 4 )Inequality's right side: ( -4 + 8 - 3 = 1 )So, 4 < 1? No, that's false.Another point, x = 1.5:Screen's y: ( -(2.25) + 6 = 3.75 )Inequality's right side: ( -2.25 + 6 - 3 = 0.75 )So, 3.75 < 0.75? No.x = 2.5:Screen's y: ( -6.25 + 10 = 3.75 )Inequality's right side: ( -6.25 + 10 - 3 = 0.75 )Again, 3.75 < 0.75? No.So, in the interval 1 < x < 3, the screen's y is always greater than the right side of the inequality, so the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) is never true. Therefore, the brightness effect is never applied.So, the range of ( x )-values is empty. There are no ( x )-values where the brightness effect is applied.Wait, but the problem says the filmmaker decides to use this filter. So, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the inequality is supposed to be ( y > -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), which would make sense because then the brightness is applied where the screen's y is above that curve. Let me check.If the inequality was ( y > -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), then substituting the screen's y:( -x^2 + 4x > -x^2 + 4x - 3 )Which simplifies to 0 > -3, which is true. So, the brightness would be applied everywhere on the screen. But the problem says ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), so maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.Alternatively, maybe the inequality is supposed to be ( y < (-x^2 + 4x) - 3 ), which is the same as ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, again, same conclusion.Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the range of ( x ) where ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), which is 1 < x < 3, and that's where the brightness is applied. But the problem says the brightness is applied where ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), which is never true on the screen. So, perhaps the answer is that there are no ( x )-values where the brightness is applied.Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and the inequality should be ( y > -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), which would make the brightness applied everywhere. But since the problem says ( y < ), I have to go with that.So, in conclusion, for part 1, the intersection points are (0, 0) and (4, 0). For part 2, the range of ( x )-values where the brightness effect is applied is empty, meaning there are no such ( x )-values.But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try solving the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) without substituting the screen's equation. So, solving for ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). Since ( y ) can be any value, but the screen is defined by ( y = -x^2 + 4x ), the brightness is applied where the screen's ( y ) is less than ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). But as we saw, that's never true. So, the answer is no solution.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the range of ( x ) where ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), which is 1 < x < 3. But the problem says the brightness is applied where ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), so I'm confused.Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the range of ( x ) where the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) holds true, regardless of the screen.

If that's the case, then substituting the screen's ( y ):( -x^2 + 4x > -x^2 + 4x - 3 )Which simplifies to 0 > -3, which is always true. So, the brightness would be applied everywhere on the screen. But since the problem says ( y < ), I have to go with that.So, in conclusion, for part 1, the intersection points are (0, 0) and (4, 0). For part 2, the range of ( x )-values where the brightness effect is applied is empty, meaning there are no such ( x )-values.But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try solving the inequality ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ) again. We found that it's true for 1 < x < 3. So, perhaps the brightness is applied where ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), which is between 1 and 3. But the problem says the brightness is applied where ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ). So, if ( -x^2 + 4x - 3 > 0 ), then ( y < ) a positive number. But the screen's ( y ) is also positive in that interval, so it's possible that ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) is true in some parts of that interval.Wait, let's test x = 1.5 again:Screen's y: 3.75Inequality's right side: 0.75So, 3.75 < 0.75? No.x = 2:Screen's y: 4Inequality's right side: 14 < 1? No.x = 2.5:Screen's y: 3.75Inequality's right side: 0.753.75 < 0.75? No.So, in the interval 1 < x < 3, the screen's y is always greater than the right side of the inequality, so the inequality ( y < -x^2 + 4x - 3 ) is never true. Therefore, the brightness effect is never applied.So, the range of ( x )-values is empty.But that seems odd because the problem mentions the filmmaker using this filter. Maybe the problem intended the inequality to be ( y > -x^2 + 4x - 3 ), which would make the brightness applied everywhere. But since it's ( y < ), I have to go with that.Therefore, the answer for part 2 is that there are no ( x )-values where the brightness effect is applied."},{"question":"A breast cancer survivor undergoes regular radiology tests every 6 months to monitor her health. The cost of each radiology test is 500. However, her insurance covers 70% of the cost after she pays an annual deductible of 200. 1. Let ( x ) represent the total number of radiology tests she undergoes in a year. Write an expression for the total amount she pays out-of-pocket for these tests in a year, considering both her deductible and the insurance coverage.2. Given that she wants to minimize her out-of-pocket expenses and can choose to undergo either 2 or 3 tests in a year, solve the inequality to determine the maximum number of tests she should choose to keep her out-of-pocket expenses under 600 for the year.","answer":"First, I need to understand the components of the out-of-pocket expenses. The patient has an annual deductible of 200, which she must pay before insurance starts covering part of the costs. Each radiology test costs 500, and insurance covers 70% of the cost after the deductible is met.For part 1, I'll calculate the total out-of-pocket expense by considering both the deductible and the portion of each test not covered by insurance. The deductible is a one-time annual expense. After meeting the deductible, the patient pays 30% of each test's cost because insurance covers 70%. Therefore, the total out-of-pocket expense can be expressed as the sum of the deductible and 30% of the cost per test multiplied by the number of tests.For part 2, I'll set up an inequality to ensure the total out-of-pocket expenses are under 600. I'll plug in the values for 2 and 3 tests into the expression derived in part 1 and solve the inequality to determine the maximum number of tests she can have while keeping her expenses below 600."},{"question":"As a hopeful future adoptive parent, Alex is navigating the labyrinth of adoption paperwork, which feels like solving a complex algebraic puzzle. To avoid the daunting legal jargon, Alex decides to represent the process using a mathematical model.1. Alex estimates that the time (in hours) it takes to complete a section of the application is modeled by the quadratic equation ( t(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 ), where ( x ) represents the number of pages in that section. If Alex wants to know how many pages they can handle in a section to keep the completion time under 10 hours, solve the inequality ( 2x^2 - 5x + 3 < 10 ) for ( x ).2. To prepare for possible delays caused by bureaucracy, Alex also models the additional waiting time (in weeks) as a rational expression ( w(y) = frac{3y + 4}{y - 2} ), where ( y ) is the number of additional forms required by the agency. Determine the domain of the expression ( w(y) ) and explain what values of ( y ) would cause the waiting time calculation to be undefined.","answer":"Alright, so Alex is trying to figure out how many pages they can handle in a section of the adoption paperwork without spending more than 10 hours on it. The time it takes is modeled by the quadratic equation ( t(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 ). So, I need to solve the inequality ( 2x^2 - 5x + 3 < 10 ) to find the range of pages ( x ) that keeps the time under 10 hours.First, I should probably move the 10 to the left side to set up the inequality properly. That would give me:( 2x^2 - 5x + 3 - 10 < 0 )Simplifying that, it becomes:( 2x^2 - 5x - 7 < 0 )Okay, so now I have a quadratic inequality. To solve this, I need to find the roots of the quadratic equation ( 2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 0 ). Once I have the roots, I can determine the intervals where the quadratic expression is less than zero.Let me use the quadratic formula to find the roots. The quadratic formula is ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = 2 ), ( b = -5 ), and ( c = -7 ).Plugging in the values:( x = frac{-(-5) pm sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4*2*(-7)}}{2*2} )Simplifying the numerator:( x = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 + 56}}{4} )Because ( -4*2*(-7) ) is positive 56, right? So, adding 25 and 56 gives 81.So, ( x = frac{5 pm sqrt{81}}{4} )Since ( sqrt{81} = 9 ), this becomes:( x = frac{5 pm 9}{4} )So, two solutions:1. ( x = frac{5 + 9}{4} = frac{14}{4} = 3.5 )2. ( x = frac{5 - 9}{4} = frac{-4}{4} = -1 )Hmm, so the roots are at ( x = -1 ) and ( x = 3.5 ). Since the number of pages can't be negative, ( x = -1 ) doesn't make sense in this context. So, the critical point is at ( x = 3.5 ).Now, since the quadratic opens upwards (because the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive), the expression ( 2x^2 - 5x - 7 ) will be below zero between the two roots. But since one root is negative and not applicable, the interval where the expression is negative is from ( x = -1 ) to ( x = 3.5 ). However, since ( x ) can't be negative, the relevant interval is ( 0 < x < 3.5 ).But wait, let me double-check. If I pick a value between -1 and 3.5, say x=0, plug into the quadratic:( 2(0)^2 -5(0) -7 = -7 < 0 ). So yes, it's negative there.If I pick a value greater than 3.5, say x=4:( 2(16) -5(4) -7 = 32 -20 -7 = 5 > 0 ). So, positive.And for x less than -1, say x=-2:( 2(4) -5(-2) -7 = 8 +10 -7 = 11 > 0 ). Positive as well.So, the inequality ( 2x^2 -5x -7 < 0 ) holds for ( -1 < x < 3.5 ). But since x represents pages, it can't be negative, so the solution is ( 0 < x < 3.5 ).Therefore, Alex can handle up to 3.5 pages in a section to keep the time under 10 hours. But since you can't have half a page, maybe Alex can handle up to 3 pages? Or perhaps 3.5 is acceptable if it's referring to partial pages. The problem doesn't specify, so I think 3.5 is the exact value, so the number of pages should be less than 3.5.Moving on to the second problem. Alex models the additional waiting time as ( w(y) = frac{3y + 4}{y - 2} ). I need to determine the domain of this expression and explain what values of ( y ) make the waiting time undefined.The domain of a rational expression is all real numbers except where the denominator is zero because division by zero is undefined. So, I need to find the value of ( y ) that makes ( y - 2 = 0 ).Solving ( y - 2 = 0 ):( y = 2 )So, the expression is undefined when ( y = 2 ). Therefore, the domain is all real numbers except ( y = 2 ).In terms of the context, ( y ) represents the number of additional forms required. Since you can't have a negative number of forms, ( y ) should be a positive integer. But mathematically, the expression is undefined only at ( y = 2 ). So, Alex should ensure that the number of additional forms isn't 2, or else the waiting time calculation breaks down.Wait, but in reality, ( y ) is likely a positive integer, right? So, even though mathematically ( y ) can be any real number except 2, in the context of adoption forms, ( y ) must be a positive integer. So, the domain in context would be all positive integers except 2. But the problem doesn't specify that ( y ) has to be an integer, so I think the answer is just all real numbers except 2.So, summarizing:1. For the quadratic inequality, Alex can handle up to 3.5 pages to keep the time under 10 hours.2. The domain of ( w(y) ) is all real numbers except ( y = 2 ), which would make the waiting time undefined.I think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.For the quadratic, solving ( 2x^2 -5x -7 = 0 ) gave roots at -1 and 3.5. Since the quadratic opens upwards, the expression is negative between the roots. So, for ( x ) between -1 and 3.5, the time is under 10 hours. Since pages can't be negative, it's 0 to 3.5.For the rational expression, denominator zero at y=2, so domain is all real numbers except 2.Yes, that seems correct.**Final Answer**1. The number of pages Alex can handle is boxed{left(0, frac{7}{2}right)}.2. The domain of ( w(y) ) is all real numbers except ( y = 2 ), so boxed{y neq 2}."},{"question":"A literary critic is analyzing the growth of mystery novels in the market over the past few years. The critic models the number of new mystery novels published each year, ( n(x) ), as a quadratic function of time ( x ), where ( x ) is the number of years since 2020. The model is given by the equation ( n(x) = -3x^2 + 12x + 100 ).1. Determine the number of years after 2020 when the number of new mystery novels published will first drop below 100. Express your answer in whole years.2. Assuming that the critic considers more than 120 new mystery novels per year to be an oversaturated market, find the range of years (again since 2020) during which the market will be considered oversaturated.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a literary critic modeling the number of new mystery novels published each year as a quadratic function. The function given is ( n(x) = -3x^2 + 12x + 100 ), where ( x ) is the number of years since 2020. There are two parts to the problem.Starting with the first question: Determine the number of years after 2020 when the number of new mystery novels published will first drop below 100. Hmm, so I need to find the smallest whole number ( x ) such that ( n(x) < 100 ).Let me write down the inequality:( -3x^2 + 12x + 100 < 100 )Subtracting 100 from both sides to simplify:( -3x^2 + 12x < 0 )Hmm, that simplifies to:( -3x^2 + 12x < 0 )I can factor out a common term, which is -3x:( -3x(x - 4) < 0 )So, the inequality is ( -3x(x - 4) < 0 ). To solve this, I can analyze the critical points where the expression equals zero, which are at ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 4 ). These points divide the number line into intervals. I'll test each interval to see where the inequality holds.The intervals are:1. ( x < 0 )2. ( 0 < x < 4 )3. ( x > 4 )But since ( x ) represents years since 2020, it can't be negative. So, we only consider ( x geq 0 ).Testing the interval ( 0 < x < 4 ):Let's pick ( x = 2 ):( -3(2)(2 - 4) = -3*2*(-2) = 12 ), which is positive. Since we have ( < 0 ), this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality.Testing the interval ( x > 4 ):Let's pick ( x = 5 ):( -3(5)(5 - 4) = -3*5*1 = -15 ), which is negative. So, this interval satisfies the inequality.Therefore, the inequality ( -3x(x - 4) < 0 ) holds for ( x > 4 ). Since we're looking for the first year when the number drops below 100, it's the smallest integer greater than 4, which is 5.Wait, but let me double-check by plugging ( x = 4 ) into the original function:( n(4) = -3(16) + 12(4) + 100 = -48 + 48 + 100 = 100 ). So at ( x = 4 ), it's exactly 100. So, the first year when it drops below 100 is ( x = 5 ).So, the answer to part 1 is 5 years after 2020, which would be 2025.Moving on to part 2: The critic considers more than 120 new mystery novels per year to be an oversaturated market. We need to find the range of years during which the market will be considered oversaturated. So, we need to find all ( x ) such that ( n(x) > 120 ).Setting up the inequality:( -3x^2 + 12x + 100 > 120 )Subtracting 120 from both sides:( -3x^2 + 12x - 20 > 0 )Let me write that as:( -3x^2 + 12x - 20 > 0 )It might be easier to handle this quadratic inequality if I multiply both sides by -1, but I have to remember to reverse the inequality sign. So:( 3x^2 - 12x + 20 < 0 )Now, let's analyze the quadratic ( 3x^2 - 12x + 20 ). To find where it's less than zero, we can find its roots and see where it's negative.First, let's compute the discriminant ( D = b^2 - 4ac ):( D = (-12)^2 - 4*3*20 = 144 - 240 = -96 )Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic does not cross the x-axis and has no real roots. The coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive (3), so the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the quadratic is always positive, meaning ( 3x^2 - 12x + 20 > 0 ) for all real ( x ). But wait, that would mean our inequality ( 3x^2 - 12x + 20 < 0 ) has no solution. That suggests that ( n(x) > 120 ) never occurs. Hmm, that seems odd. Let me double-check my steps.Starting again:Original inequality: ( n(x) > 120 )So,( -3x^2 + 12x + 100 > 120 )Subtract 120:( -3x^2 + 12x - 20 > 0 )Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality flips):( 3x^2 - 12x + 20 < 0 )Quadratic equation: ( 3x^2 - 12x + 20 = 0 )Discriminant: ( D = 144 - 240 = -96 ). So, no real roots. Since the quadratic opens upwards (coefficient positive), it's always positive. Thus, ( 3x^2 - 12x + 20 < 0 ) is never true. So, ( n(x) > 120 ) is never true. That would mean the market is never oversaturated according to this model.But that seems counterintuitive. Let me check the vertex of the original quadratic ( n(x) = -3x^2 + 12x + 100 ). The vertex is at ( x = -b/(2a) = -12/(2*(-3)) = -12/(-6) = 2 ). So, the maximum occurs at ( x = 2 ). Let's compute ( n(2) ):( n(2) = -3*(4) + 12*(2) + 100 = -12 + 24 + 100 = 112 ). So, the maximum number of novels is 112 in the year 2022 (x=2). Therefore, the number never exceeds 112, which is less than 120. So, indeed, the market is never oversaturated because the maximum is 112, which is below 120.Therefore, the range of years when the market is oversaturated is empty. There are no such years.Wait, but the question says \\"the range of years during which the market will be considered oversaturated.\\" If it's never oversaturated, then the range is empty. So, perhaps we can express that as no solution or an empty set.But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the inequality.Wait, the original function is ( n(x) = -3x^2 + 12x + 100 ). So, it's a downward opening parabola, peaking at x=2 with n(2)=112. So, it starts at x=0: n(0)=100, goes up to 112 at x=2, then decreases. So, it never goes above 112, which is less than 120. Therefore, n(x) never exceeds 112, so it never goes above 120. So, the market is never oversaturated. Therefore, the range is empty.But maybe I should write that there are no such years. Alternatively, if the question expects a range, perhaps from x=0 to x=4, but no, because n(x) is 100 at x=0 and x=4, and peaks at 112 in between. So, it's above 100 from x=0 to x=4, but never above 120.Wait, but n(x) is 100 at x=0, goes up to 112 at x=2, then back down to 100 at x=4. So, n(x) is always between 100 and 112. So, it never exceeds 112, so it never goes above 120. Therefore, the market is never oversaturated.So, the answer to part 2 is that there are no years where the market is oversaturated.But let me double-check by plugging in x=1:n(1) = -3(1) +12(1) +100 = -3 +12 +100=109x=2: 112x=3: -27 +36 +100=109x=4: 100So, yeah, it never goes above 112, so never above 120.Therefore, the answer is that there are no such years.But the question says \\"find the range of years... during which the market will be considered oversaturated.\\" So, if it's never oversaturated, the range is empty. So, perhaps we can express it as no solution or an empty interval.Alternatively, if we have to write it in terms of x, maybe from x=0 to x=0, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps just state that there are no years where the market is oversaturated.So, summarizing:1. The number of years after 2020 when the number first drops below 100 is 5.2. There are no years when the market is oversaturated.But let me check the first part again. At x=4, n(x)=100, and at x=5, n(x)= -3*(25) +12*5 +100= -75 +60 +100=85. So, yes, at x=5, it's 85, which is below 100. So, the first year it drops below 100 is x=5.Therefore, the answers are:1. 5 years2. No years, or empty set.But since the question asks for the range of years, perhaps we can write it as no solution or an empty interval. Alternatively, if we have to write it in terms of x, maybe from x=0 to x=0, but that's not correct.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic. Let me check the original function again.n(x) = -3x² +12x +100At x=0: 100x=1: -3 +12 +100=109x=2: -12 +24 +100=112x=3: -27 +36 +100=109x=4: -48 +48 +100=100x=5: -75 +60 +100=85So, yes, it peaks at x=2 with 112, which is less than 120. So, n(x) never exceeds 112, so never goes above 120. Therefore, the market is never oversaturated.So, the answer to part 2 is that there are no such years.But perhaps the question expects a different approach. Maybe I should consider that the quadratic could have been misinterpreted. Let me check the original function again: n(x) = -3x² +12x +100. Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I should solve the inequality ( -3x^2 + 12x + 100 > 120 ) without multiplying by -1.So, ( -3x^2 + 12x + 100 > 120 )Subtract 120:( -3x^2 + 12x - 20 > 0 )Let me factor this quadratic or find its roots.Quadratic equation: ( -3x^2 + 12x - 20 = 0 )Multiply both sides by -1: ( 3x^2 -12x +20=0 )Discriminant: ( D = 144 - 240 = -96 ). So, no real roots. Therefore, the quadratic ( -3x^2 +12x -20 ) is always negative because the coefficient of x² is negative. So, ( -3x^2 +12x -20 > 0 ) is never true. Therefore, n(x) >120 is never true.So, yes, the market is never oversaturated.Therefore, the answer to part 2 is that there are no years where the market is oversaturated.So, to recap:1. The number of years after 2020 when the number first drops below 100 is 5.2. There are no years when the market is oversaturated.I think that's the correct conclusion."},{"question":"A film editor, who is an advocate of traditional storytelling techniques, is tasked with editing a film project that involves a sequence of scenes.

The director used an unconventional approach, so now the editor needs to simplify it. There are two main tasks here, both involving some algebra, which I think I can handle, but let me take it step by step.First, the editor needs to determine the optimal sequence of 5 scenes that tells a cohesive story. The polynomial given is ( p(x) = 2x^3 - 15x^2 + 24x - 9 ). The roots of this polynomial will represent the potential positions where the story naturally transitions. So, I need to find the values of ( x ) for which ( p(x) = 0 ).Okay, so solving a cubic equation. Cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe this one factors nicely. Let me try to factor it. I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can help find possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient.In this case, the constant term is -9, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, possible rational roots are ( pm1, pm3, pm9, pmfrac{1}{2}, pmfrac{3}{2}, pmfrac{9}{2} ).Let me test these one by one. I'll start with ( x = 1 ):( p(1) = 2(1)^3 - 15(1)^2 + 24(1) - 9 = 2 - 15 + 24 - 9 = 2 - 15 is -13, -13 +24 is 11, 11 -9 is 2. Not zero.Next, ( x = 3 ):( p(3) = 2(27) - 15(9) + 24(3) - 9 = 54 - 135 + 72 - 9 ). Let's compute step by step:54 - 135 = -81-81 +72 = -9-9 -9 = -18. Not zero.How about ( x = frac{3}{2} ):( p(3/2) = 2*(27/8) - 15*(9/4) + 24*(3/2) - 9 )Compute each term:2*(27/8) = 54/8 = 27/4 = 6.7515*(9/4) = 135/4 = 33.7524*(3/2) = 36So, putting it all together:6.75 - 33.75 + 36 - 96.75 -33.75 = -27-27 +36 = 99 -9 = 0. Oh, that works! So, ( x = frac{3}{2} ) is a root.So, we can factor out ( (x - 3/2) ) from the polynomial. To do this, I can use polynomial division or synthetic division. Maybe synthetic division is quicker.Let me set up synthetic division with root 3/2.The coefficients are 2, -15, 24, -9.Bring down the 2.Multiply 2 by 3/2 = 3. Add to -15: -12.Multiply -12 by 3/2 = -18. Add to 24: 6.Multiply 6 by 3/2 = 9. Add to -9: 0. Perfect.So, the polynomial factors into ( (x - 3/2)(2x^2 - 12x + 6) ).Now, we can factor the quadratic ( 2x^2 - 12x + 6 ). Let's factor out a 2 first:2(x^2 - 6x + 3). Now, let's try to factor ( x^2 - 6x + 3 ). The discriminant is ( 36 - 12 = 24 ), which isn't a perfect square, so we'll have to use the quadratic formula.Quadratic formula: ( x = frac{6 pm sqrt{36 - 12}}{2} = frac{6 pm sqrt{24}}{2} = frac{6 pm 2sqrt{6}}{2} = 3 pm sqrt{6} ).So, the roots are ( x = frac{3}{2} ), ( x = 3 + sqrt{6} ), and ( x = 3 - sqrt{6} ).Let me approximate ( sqrt{6} ) to check the values. ( sqrt{6} ) is approximately 2.449.So, ( 3 + sqrt{6} approx 5.449 ) and ( 3 - sqrt{6} approx 0.551 ).So, the roots are approximately 0.551, 1.5, and 5.449.But since ( x ) represents the order of the scenes, it should be a positive integer, right? Because you can't have a scene at position 0.551 or 5.449; it has to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.Wait, but the polynomial is given for the sequence of scenes, which are 5 scenes. So, x is from 1 to 5.But the roots are at approximately 0.551, 1.5, and 5.449. So, within the range of 1 to 5, the roots are at 1.5 and 5.449. But 5.449 is beyond 5, so the only root within 1 to 5 is 1.5.Hmm, but the problem says \\"the values of x for which the polynomial is equal to zero, as these values represent the potential positions where the story naturally transitions.\\"So, does that mean that the transitions occur at x=1.5 and x=5.449? But since x must be an integer, maybe the transitions are between scenes 1 and 2, and between scenes 5 and 6, but since there are only 5 scenes, maybe the transition at 5.449 is beyond the last scene.Wait, the polynomial is for the sequence of 5 scenes, so x would be 1 to 5. So, the roots within this interval are at x=1.5 and x=5.449, but 5.449 is outside the 1-5 range.So, maybe only x=1.5 is within the 1-5 range. So, the transition occurs between scene 1 and 2.But the problem says \\"the values of x for which the polynomial is equal to zero,\\" so maybe they are considering x as real numbers, not necessarily integers. So, the transitions happen at x≈0.551, 1.5, and 5.449.But since the scenes are ordered from 1 to 5, the transitions would be between scenes 0 and 1 (but there is no scene 0), between 1 and 2, and between 5 and 6 (but there is no scene 6). So, the only meaningful transition within the 5 scenes is at x=1.5, which is between scene 1 and 2.But the problem mentions \\"the optimal sequence of 5 scenes,\\" so maybe the roots indicate where the story should transition, but since we have 5 scenes, perhaps the transitions are at x=1.5 and x=5.449, but since 5.449 is beyond 5, maybe the last transition is at the end.Alternatively, perhaps the roots are indicating that the story naturally transitions at these points, so the editor should structure the scenes around these transition points.But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the roots are just the points where the polynomial crosses zero, and these could be the points where the narrative shifts. So, for the 5 scenes, the transitions are at x≈1.5 and x≈5.449. Since 5.449 is beyond 5, maybe the last transition is at the end of scene 5.But the question is asking for the values of x where the polynomial is zero, so regardless of the context, mathematically, the roots are x=3/2, 3+√6, and 3-√6.So, writing them as exact values, it's x=3/2, x=3+√6, and x=3-√6.But the problem mentions \\"the optimal sequence of 5 scenes,\\" so maybe the editor needs to arrange the scenes such that these transition points are considered. But since the roots are at non-integer positions, perhaps the editor needs to structure the scenes around these points, maybe cutting or rearranging to make the narrative flow better.But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The first part just asks to find the values of x where p(x)=0, so the roots are x=3/2, 3+√6, and 3-√6.Moving on to the second problem. The editor needs to solve the inequality ( 3x^2 - 12x + 9 < 0 ) to determine the range of scenes to emphasize.First, let's solve the inequality. Let's factor the quadratic if possible.( 3x^2 - 12x + 9 ). Factor out a 3: 3(x^2 - 4x + 3). Now, factor x^2 -4x +3: (x-1)(x-3). So, the inequality becomes 3(x-1)(x-3) < 0.Since 3 is positive, we can divide both sides by 3 without changing the inequality direction: (x-1)(x-3) < 0.Now, to solve (x-1)(x-3) < 0, we can find the critical points at x=1 and x=3. These divide the number line into three intervals:1. x < 12. 1 < x < 33. x > 3We can test each interval:1. For x < 1, say x=0: (0-1)(0-3) = (-1)(-3)=3 >0. So, not less than zero.2. For 1 < x <3, say x=2: (2-1)(2-3)= (1)(-1)=-1 <0. So, satisfies the inequality.3. For x>3, say x=4: (4-1)(4-3)=3*1=3>0. Not less than zero.So, the solution is 1 < x < 3.But since x represents the order of scenes, which are integers, x must be 2. So, the range of scenes to emphasize is scene 2.Wait, but the inequality is 1 < x <3, which in real numbers is between 1 and 3, but since x is integer, x=2 is the only integer in that interval.So, the editor should emphasize scene 2.But let me double-check. The quadratic ( 3x^2 -12x +9 ) can be rewritten as 3(x^2 -4x +3). The roots are at x=1 and x=3. The parabola opens upwards (since the coefficient of x^2 is positive), so it is below zero between the roots. So, yes, the inequality holds for 1 <x <3.Therefore, the scenes to emphasize are those where x is between 1 and 3, which is scene 2.But wait, the original screenplay has a dynamic scene that alternates between two timelines. The editor decides to focus on one timeline by solving this inequality. So, perhaps the scenes that should be emphasized are those where x is between 1 and 3, meaning scenes 2 and maybe parts of 1 and 3? But since x must be integer, only scene 2 is in that interval.Alternatively, maybe the scenes are continuous, so the editor should focus on the parts of the scenes where x is between 1 and 3, but since scenes are discrete, it's just scene 2.Hmm, I think the answer is that the scenes to emphasize are those where x is between 1 and 3, so scene 2.But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in factoring.Original quadratic: 3x^2 -12x +9.Factor out 3: 3(x^2 -4x +3). Then factor x^2 -4x +3: (x-1)(x-3). So, yes, correct.So, the inequality is satisfied for 1 <x <3, which in integer terms is x=2.So, the editor should emphasize scene 2.Wait, but the problem says \\"the range of scenes that should be emphasized,\\" so maybe it's a range, not just one scene. But since x must be integer, and the inequality is 1 <x <3, which is only x=2.Alternatively, if x is considered as a continuous variable, then the range is from just after scene 1 to just before scene 3, which would include parts of scene 1, all of scene 2, and parts of scene 3. But since scenes are discrete, it's probably just scene 2.But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the problem expects the continuous range, so 1 <x <3, which is between scenes 1 and 3, but since scenes are integers, it's just scene 2.Alternatively, maybe the scenes are numbered from 0, but the problem says \\"the order of the scenes,\\" which are 5 scenes, so probably numbered 1 to 5.So, to sum up:1. The roots of the polynomial are x=3/2, x=3+√6, and x=3-√6. These are approximately 1.5, 5.449, and 0.551. So, within the context of 5 scenes, the meaningful transition is at x=1.5, between scene 1 and 2.2. The inequality 3x^2 -12x +9 <0 is satisfied for 1 <x <3, which in integer terms is x=2. So, the editor should emphasize scene 2.But wait, the first part asks for the values of x where p(x)=0, which are the roots, so the exact values are x=3/2, 3+√6, and 3-√6.So, for the first question, the answer is x=3/2, 3+√6, and 3-√6.For the second question, the solution is 1 <x <3, so in terms of scenes, x=2.But let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.For the first polynomial:p(x) = 2x^3 -15x^2 +24x -9.We found that x=3/2 is a root, then factored it as (x-3/2)(2x^2 -12x +6). Then factoring the quadratic: 2(x^2 -6x +3). Then using quadratic formula: x=(6±√(36-12))/2= (6±√24)/2=3±√6. Correct.So, roots are 3/2, 3+√6, 3-√6.For the inequality:3x^2 -12x +9 <0.Factored as 3(x-1)(x-3) <0.Critical points at x=1 and x=3. Test intervals:x<1: positive.1<x<3: negative.x>3: positive.So, solution is 1<x<3.Since x is the order of scenes, which are integers, x=2.So, the editor should emphasize scene 2.I think that's it."},{"question":"A biologist is studying the growth patterns of a plant species that exhibits exponential growth influenced by environmental factors such as sunlight and water availability. The biologist models the plant's height, ( h(t) ), in centimeters, as a function of time ( t ) in days using the polynomial equation:[ h(t) = -2t^3 + 15t^2 + 4t + 5. ]1. Determine the time ( t ) at which the plant reaches its maximum height within the interval ( 0 leq t leq 10 ).Additionally, the biologist is interested in the potential for genetic crossover between this plant species and another with a different growth pattern. The second plant's height ( g(t) ) is modeled by a quadratic equation:[ g(t) = 3t^2 - 12t + 9. ]2. At what time ( t ) does the height of the first plant equal the height of the second plant within the interval ( 0 leq t leq 10 )?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about two plants growing, and I need to figure out two things. First, when does the first plant reach its maximum height, and second, when do both plants have the same height. Let me take this step by step.Starting with the first part: the plant's height is modeled by the polynomial ( h(t) = -2t^3 + 15t^2 + 4t + 5 ). They want to know the time ( t ) within 0 to 10 days when the plant is tallest. Hmm, okay. Since this is a polynomial, specifically a cubic function, it can have a local maximum and minimum. But since the leading coefficient is negative (-2), the cubic will tend to negative infinity as ( t ) increases, so it should have a single local maximum somewhere.To find the maximum, I remember from calculus that I need to take the derivative of ( h(t) ) with respect to ( t ) and set it equal to zero. That should give me the critical points, which could be maxima or minima. Let me compute that.The derivative ( h'(t) ) is:( h'(t) = d/dt (-2t^3 + 15t^2 + 4t + 5) )Calculating term by term:- The derivative of ( -2t^3 ) is ( -6t^2 ).- The derivative of ( 15t^2 ) is ( 30t ).- The derivative of ( 4t ) is 4.- The derivative of the constant 5 is 0.So putting it all together:( h'(t) = -6t^2 + 30t + 4 )Now, to find critical points, set ( h'(t) = 0 ):( -6t^2 + 30t + 4 = 0 )This is a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:( -6t^2 + 30t + 4 = 0 )I can multiply both sides by -1 to make it a bit easier:( 6t^2 - 30t - 4 = 0 )Now, using the quadratic formula ( t = [-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}]/(2a) ), where ( a = 6 ), ( b = -30 ), and ( c = -4 ).Plugging in:( t = [30 pm sqrt{(-30)^2 - 4*6*(-4)}]/(2*6) )Calculating discriminant:( (-30)^2 = 900 )( 4*6*4 = 96 ), but since it's -4ac, it's -4*6*(-4) = +96So discriminant is 900 + 96 = 996So,( t = [30 pm sqrt{996}]/12 )Simplify sqrt(996). Let's see, 996 divided by 4 is 249, so sqrt(996) = 2*sqrt(249). Hmm, sqrt(249) is approximately sqrt(225 + 24) = 15 + something. Let me compute sqrt(249):15^2 = 225, 16^2=256, so sqrt(249) is about 15.78. Therefore, sqrt(996) ≈ 2*15.78 ≈ 31.56.So, plugging back in:( t = [30 pm 31.56]/12 )Calculating both possibilities:First, with the plus sign:( t = (30 + 31.56)/12 ≈ 61.56/12 ≈ 5.13 ) days.Second, with the minus sign:( t = (30 - 31.56)/12 ≈ (-1.56)/12 ≈ -0.13 ) days.But time can't be negative, so we discard the negative solution. So the critical point is at approximately 5.13 days.Now, we need to check whether this is a maximum or a minimum. Since the original function is a cubic with a negative leading coefficient, the function will go from positive infinity to negative infinity, so the critical point at t ≈5.13 is a local maximum.Therefore, the plant reaches its maximum height at approximately 5.13 days. But since the problem asks for the time within 0 ≤ t ≤10, we should check the endpoints as well to ensure this is indeed the maximum.Compute h(0), h(5.13), and h(10):First, h(0):( h(0) = -2*(0)^3 + 15*(0)^2 + 4*(0) + 5 = 5 ) cm.Next, h(5.13):Let me compute h(5.13):First, compute each term:- ( -2*(5.13)^3 )- ( 15*(5.13)^2 )- ( 4*(5.13) )- 5Compute step by step:First, 5.13^3:5.13 * 5.13 = approx 26.316926.3169 * 5.13 ≈ 26.3169*5 + 26.3169*0.13 ≈ 131.5845 + 3.4212 ≈ 135.0057So, -2*(135.0057) ≈ -270.0114Next, 15*(5.13)^2:We have 5.13^2 ≈26.3169, so 15*26.3169 ≈ 394.7535Then, 4*(5.13) ≈20.52Adding all together:-270.0114 + 394.7535 + 20.52 +5Compute step by step:-270.0114 + 394.7535 ≈ 124.7421124.7421 + 20.52 ≈ 145.2621145.2621 +5 ≈150.2621 cm.So h(5.13) ≈150.26 cm.Now, h(10):Compute each term:- ( -2*(10)^3 = -2*1000 = -2000 )- ( 15*(10)^2 = 15*100 = 1500 )- ( 4*10 = 40 )- 5Adding up:-2000 + 1500 = -500-500 +40 = -460-460 +5 = -455 cm.Wait, that can't be right. The height can't be negative. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.Wait, let me recompute h(10):( h(10) = -2*(10)^3 +15*(10)^2 +4*(10) +5 )Compute each term:-2*(1000) = -200015*(100) = 15004*10 =40+5So, adding all together:-2000 +1500 = -500-500 +40 = -460-460 +5 = -455Hmm, that's negative. But height can't be negative. Maybe the model isn't valid beyond a certain point? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, let me check the original function:h(t) = -2t^3 +15t^2 +4t +5So, at t=10, it's indeed:-2*(1000) +15*(100) +40 +5 = -2000 +1500 +40 +5 = (-2000 +1500) = -500; (-500 +40) = -460; (-460 +5) = -455.So, according to the model, the height is negative at t=10, which doesn't make physical sense. So, perhaps the model is only valid up to a certain time before the height becomes negative, which would be when h(t)=0.But in any case, for the purposes of this problem, we are to consider the interval 0 ≤ t ≤10, even though the model gives a negative height at t=10.So, comparing h(0)=5, h(5.13)≈150.26, and h(10)=-455. So clearly, the maximum height is at t≈5.13 days.But since the problem asks for the time, maybe we can express it more precisely.Earlier, I approximated sqrt(996) as 31.56, but let's compute it more accurately.Compute sqrt(996):We know that 31^2=961 and 32^2=1024.So sqrt(996) is between 31 and 32.Compute 31.5^2=992.2531.5^2=992.2531.56^2: Let's compute 31.56^2.31 + 0.56(31 + 0.56)^2 = 31^2 + 2*31*0.56 + 0.56^2 = 961 + 34.72 + 0.3136 ≈961 +34.72=995.72 +0.3136≈996.0336Wow, that's very close to 996. So sqrt(996)≈31.56So, the critical point is at t=(30 +31.56)/12≈61.56/12≈5.13 days.So, t≈5.13 days.But to be precise, maybe we can write it as an exact value.From the quadratic equation:t = [30 ± sqrt(996)]/12sqrt(996) can be simplified:996=4*249, so sqrt(996)=2*sqrt(249)Thus,t=(30 ±2*sqrt(249))/12Simplify numerator and denominator:Divide numerator and denominator by 2:t=(15 ±sqrt(249))/6So, the critical points are t=(15 + sqrt(249))/6 and t=(15 - sqrt(249))/6Since sqrt(249)≈15.78, so t=(15 +15.78)/6≈30.78/6≈5.13, and t=(15 -15.78)/6≈-0.78/6≈-0.13, which is negative, so we discard.So, exact value is t=(15 + sqrt(249))/6But maybe we can rationalize or write it differently.Alternatively, we can leave it as t≈5.13 days.But perhaps the problem expects an exact value? Hmm, the question says \\"determine the time t\\", so maybe they want the exact value.So, t=(15 + sqrt(249))/6Alternatively, we can factor numerator:15 + sqrt(249) can't be simplified further, so that's the exact value.So, I think that's the answer for part 1.Moving on to part 2: When do the two plants have the same height? So, set h(t)=g(t).Given:h(t) = -2t^3 +15t^2 +4t +5g(t) = 3t^2 -12t +9Set them equal:-2t^3 +15t^2 +4t +5 = 3t^2 -12t +9Bring all terms to one side:-2t^3 +15t^2 +4t +5 -3t^2 +12t -9 =0Simplify:Combine like terms:-2t^3 + (15t^2 -3t^2) + (4t +12t) + (5 -9) =0So:-2t^3 +12t^2 +16t -4=0So, equation is:-2t^3 +12t^2 +16t -4=0We can multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:2t^3 -12t^2 -16t +4=0So, 2t^3 -12t^2 -16t +4=0This is a cubic equation. Let me see if I can factor this.First, factor out a 2:2(t^3 -6t^2 -8t +2)=0So, t^3 -6t^2 -8t +2=0Now, let's try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of constant term (2) over factors of leading coefficient (1). So possible roots: ±1, ±2.Test t=1:1 -6 -8 +2=1 -6= -5; -5 -8= -13; -13 +2= -11 ≠0t=-1:-1 -6 +8 +2= (-1 -6)= -7; (-7 +8)=1; 1 +2=3 ≠0t=2:8 -24 -16 +2= (8 -24)= -16; (-16 -16)= -32; (-32 +2)= -30 ≠0t=-2:-8 -24 +16 +2= (-8 -24)= -32; (-32 +16)= -16; (-16 +2)= -14 ≠0Hmm, none of the rational roots work. So, this cubic doesn't factor nicely with rational roots. Therefore, we might need to use methods for solving cubics, or perhaps use numerical methods.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check.Original equation:-2t^3 +15t^2 +4t +5 = 3t^2 -12t +9Subtracting right side:-2t^3 +15t^2 +4t +5 -3t^2 +12t -9=0Simplify:-2t^3 +12t^2 +16t -4=0Yes, that's correct.So, 2t^3 -12t^2 -16t +4=0Alternatively, divide both sides by 2:t^3 -6t^2 -8t +2=0So, same as before.Since rational roots didn't work, perhaps we can try factoring by grouping.Looking at t^3 -6t^2 -8t +2.Group first two and last two:(t^3 -6t^2) + (-8t +2)Factor:t^2(t -6) -2(4t -1)Hmm, doesn't seem helpful.Alternatively, maybe another grouping.Wait, perhaps rearrange terms:t^3 -8t -6t^2 +2Group as (t^3 -8t) + (-6t^2 +2)Factor:t(t^2 -8) -2(3t^2 -1)Still not helpful.Alternatively, maybe use synthetic division or try to find approximate roots.Alternatively, use the method of depressed cubic or Cardano's formula, but that might be too involved.Alternatively, graph the function or use numerical methods like Newton-Raphson.Alternatively, since it's a cubic, it must have at least one real root, and up to three real roots.Given the interval 0 ≤t ≤10, let's evaluate the function at several points to approximate the roots.Let me define f(t)=t^3 -6t^2 -8t +2Compute f(t) at t=0: 0 -0 -0 +2=2t=1:1 -6 -8 +2= -11t=2:8 -24 -16 +2= -30t=3:27 -54 -24 +2= -49t=4:64 -96 -32 +2= -62t=5:125 -150 -40 +2= -63t=6:216 -216 -48 +2= -46t=7:343 -294 -56 +2= -5t=8:512 -384 -64 +2=66t=9:729 -486 -72 +2=173t=10:1000 -600 -80 +2=322So, f(t) at t=0:2t=1:-11t=2:-30t=3:-49t=4:-62t=5:-63t=6:-46t=7:-5t=8:66t=9:173t=10:322So, f(t) crosses from positive to negative between t=0 and t=1, and then from negative to positive between t=7 and t=8.So, there are two real roots in the interval 0 ≤t ≤10: one between 0 and1, and another between7 and8.But the problem says \\"at what time t does the height of the first plant equal the height of the second plant within the interval 0 ≤t ≤10\\".So, potentially two times. But let's check the original functions.Wait, h(t) is a cubic, and g(t) is a quadratic. So, their difference is a cubic, which can have up to three real roots. But in our case, f(t)=h(t)-g(t)= -2t^3 +12t^2 +16t -4, which we set to zero.Wait, actually, when I set h(t)=g(t), I got f(t)= -2t^3 +12t^2 +16t -4=0, which is the same as 2t^3 -12t^2 -16t +4=0.But when I evaluated f(t)=t^3 -6t^2 -8t +2 at various points, I found sign changes between t=0 and t=1, and between t=7 and t=8. So, two real roots in 0≤t≤10.But let's check the behavior of h(t) and g(t):h(t) is a cubic with negative leading coefficient, so it goes from positive infinity to negative infinity.g(t) is a quadratic opening upwards (since coefficient of t^2 is positive). So, it has a minimum point.Therefore, h(t) starts at h(0)=5, increases to a maximum at t≈5.13, then decreases, crossing g(t) somewhere after t=5.13.But according to f(t)=h(t)-g(t), which is a cubic, it crosses zero at t≈0. something and t≈7.something.But let's think about the physical meaning. The first plant starts at 5 cm, grows to a maximum, then decreases. The second plant is a quadratic, which is a parabola opening upwards, so it has a minimum. Let me compute g(t) at t=0: g(0)=9 cm. So, at t=0, h(t)=5, g(t)=9, so h(t) < g(t). Then, h(t) grows faster initially, reaches a maximum, then decreases, while g(t) is a parabola, which will eventually overtake h(t) as t increases.But according to f(t)=h(t)-g(t), which is a cubic, it starts positive at t=0 (h(t)=5, g(t)=9, so f(t)=5 -9= -4? Wait, no, wait.Wait, hold on, earlier I had f(t)=h(t)-g(t)= -2t^3 +12t^2 +16t -4.Wait, but when I set h(t)=g(t), I had f(t)=0, which is -2t^3 +12t^2 +16t -4=0.But when I evaluated f(t)=t^3 -6t^2 -8t +2 at t=0, I got 2, but that was after dividing by 2. Wait, perhaps I confused the functions.Wait, let me clarify:Original equation:h(t) = g(t)So,-2t^3 +15t^2 +4t +5 = 3t^2 -12t +9Bring all terms to left:-2t^3 +15t^2 +4t +5 -3t^2 +12t -9=0Simplify:-2t^3 +12t^2 +16t -4=0Multiply both sides by -1:2t^3 -12t^2 -16t +4=0Divide both sides by 2:t^3 -6t^2 -8t +2=0So, f(t)=t^3 -6t^2 -8t +2So, f(0)=0 -0 -0 +2=2f(1)=1 -6 -8 +2=-11f(2)=8 -24 -16 +2=-30f(3)=27 -54 -24 +2=-49f(4)=64 -96 -32 +2=-62f(5)=125 -150 -40 +2=-63f(6)=216 -216 -48 +2=-46f(7)=343 -294 -56 +2=-5f(8)=512 -384 -64 +2=66f(9)=729 -486 -72 +2=173f(10)=1000 -600 -80 +2=322So, f(t) crosses zero between t=0 and t=1, and between t=7 and t=8.So, two solutions in the interval 0≤t≤10.But the question is \\"at what time t does the height of the first plant equal the height of the second plant\\". So, potentially two times. But let's think about the context.At t=0, h(t)=5, g(t)=9, so h(t) < g(t). Then, h(t) grows to a maximum at t≈5.13, where h(t)=≈150 cm, while g(t) at t=5.13 is:g(5.13)=3*(5.13)^2 -12*(5.13)+9Compute:5.13^2≈26.31693*26.3169≈78.950712*5.13≈61.56So, g(5.13)=78.9507 -61.56 +9≈78.9507 -61.56=17.3907 +9≈26.3907 cm.So, at t≈5.13, h(t)=≈150 cm, g(t)=≈26 cm. So, h(t) is way above g(t) at that point.Then, h(t) starts decreasing, while g(t) is a parabola opening upwards, so it will eventually increase beyond h(t). So, the two graphs will intersect once when h(t) is increasing (before t≈5.13) and once when h(t) is decreasing (after t≈5.13). But according to f(t), the crossings are between t=0-1 and t=7-8.Wait, but at t=0, h(t)=5, g(t)=9, so h(t) < g(t). Then, h(t) increases, crosses g(t) somewhere between t=0 and t=1, then continues to increase to t≈5.13, then decreases, crossing g(t) again between t=7 and t=8.So, there are two times when h(t)=g(t): one early on, and one later.But the problem says \\"at what time t does the height of the first plant equal the height of the second plant within the interval 0 ≤t ≤10\\".So, potentially two answers. But let me check the exact question:\\"2. At what time ( t ) does the height of the first plant equal the height of the second plant within the interval ( 0 leq t leq 10 ).\\"It says \\"at what time t\\", which might imply a single time, but since it's a cubic, there could be multiple. So, perhaps both solutions are needed.But let me check the functions again.Wait, at t=0, h(t)=5, g(t)=9.At t=1, h(t)= -2 +15 +4 +5=22 cm.g(1)=3 -12 +9=0 cm.So, h(1)=22, g(1)=0. So, h(t) > g(t) at t=1.So, between t=0 and t=1, h(t) goes from 5 to22, while g(t) goes from9 to0. So, they must cross somewhere between t=0 and t=1.Similarly, at t=7, h(t)= -2*(343) +15*(49) +4*7 +5= -686 +735 +28 +5= (-686 +735)=49 +28=77 +5=82 cm.g(7)=3*49 -12*7 +9=147 -84 +9=72 cm.So, h(7)=82, g(7)=72, so h(t) >g(t) at t=7.At t=8, h(t)= -2*(512) +15*(64) +4*8 +5= -1024 +960 +32 +5= (-1024 +960)= -64 +32= -32 +5= -27 cm.g(8)=3*64 -12*8 +9=192 -96 +9=105 cm.So, h(8)= -27, g(8)=105. So, h(t) <g(t) at t=8.Therefore, between t=7 and t=8, h(t) crosses from above to below g(t). So, that's the second crossing.So, in total, two crossing points: one between t=0 and t=1, another between t=7 and t=8.But the problem says \\"at what time t\\", so maybe both are needed. Let me see if the original problem specifies something else.Looking back: \\"2. At what time ( t ) does the height of the first plant equal the height of the second plant within the interval ( 0 leq t leq 10 ).\\"It doesn't specify how many times, so perhaps both solutions are required.So, we need to find both t where f(t)=0, i.e., t≈0.something and t≈7.something.But let's compute them more accurately.First, the root between t=0 and t=1.We have f(0)=2, f(1)=-11.So, using the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a root between t=0 and t=1.Let's use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate it.Let me pick an initial guess t0=0.5.Compute f(0.5)=0.125 -6*(0.25) -8*(0.5) +2=0.125 -1.5 -4 +2= (0.125 -1.5)= -1.375; (-1.375 -4)= -5.375; (-5.375 +2)= -3.375f(0.5)= -3.375f'(t)=3t^2 -12t -8f'(0.5)=3*(0.25) -12*(0.5) -8=0.75 -6 -8= -13.25Newton-Raphson update:t1 = t0 - f(t0)/f'(t0)=0.5 - (-3.375)/(-13.25)=0.5 - (3.375/13.25)=0.5 -0.2548≈0.2452Compute f(0.2452):t=0.2452t^3≈0.2452^3≈0.0146-6t^2≈-6*(0.06)= -0.36-8t≈-8*0.2452≈-1.9616+2So, f(t)=0.0146 -0.36 -1.9616 +2≈(0.0146 -0.36)= -0.3454; (-0.3454 -1.9616)= -2.307; (-2.307 +2)= -0.307f(t)=≈-0.307f'(t)=3*(0.2452)^2 -12*(0.2452) -8≈3*(0.06) -2.9424 -8≈0.18 -2.9424 -8≈-10.7624Next iteration:t2 = t1 - f(t1)/f'(t1)=0.2452 - (-0.307)/(-10.7624)=0.2452 - (0.307/10.7624)≈0.2452 -0.0285≈0.2167Compute f(0.2167):t≈0.2167t^3≈0.0102-6t^2≈-6*(0.047)= -0.282-8t≈-8*(0.2167)= -1.7336+2So, f(t)=0.0102 -0.282 -1.7336 +2≈(0.0102 -0.282)= -0.2718; (-0.2718 -1.7336)= -2.0054; (-2.0054 +2)= -0.0054Almost zero.f'(t)=3*(0.2167)^2 -12*(0.2167) -8≈3*(0.047) -2.6004 -8≈0.141 -2.6004 -8≈-10.4594Next iteration:t3 = t2 - f(t2)/f'(t2)=0.2167 - (-0.0054)/(-10.4594)=0.2167 - (0.0054/10.4594)≈0.2167 -0.0005≈0.2162Compute f(0.2162):t≈0.2162t^3≈0.0101-6t^2≈-6*(0.0467)= -0.2802-8t≈-8*(0.2162)= -1.7296+2f(t)=0.0101 -0.2802 -1.7296 +2≈(0.0101 -0.2802)= -0.2701; (-0.2701 -1.7296)= -2.0; (-2.0 +2)=0So, f(t)=0 at t≈0.2162So, first root is approximately t≈0.216 days.Now, the second root between t=7 and t=8.Compute f(7)= -5, f(8)=66So, root between t=7 and t=8.Let's use Newton-Raphson starting at t0=7.5Compute f(7.5):t=7.5t^3=421.875-6t^2= -6*(56.25)= -337.5-8t= -60+2So, f(t)=421.875 -337.5 -60 +2≈(421.875 -337.5)=84.375; (84.375 -60)=24.375; (24.375 +2)=26.375f(7.5)=26.375f'(t)=3t^2 -12t -8f'(7.5)=3*(56.25) -12*(7.5) -8=168.75 -90 -8=70.75Newton-Raphson update:t1 = t0 - f(t0)/f'(t0)=7.5 -26.375/70.75≈7.5 -0.372≈7.128Compute f(7.128):t≈7.128t^3≈7.128^3≈7.128*7.128=50.81*7.128≈50.81*7 +50.81*0.128≈355.67 +6.49≈362.16-6t^2≈-6*(50.81)= -304.86-8t≈-8*7.128≈-57.024+2So, f(t)=362.16 -304.86 -57.024 +2≈(362.16 -304.86)=57.3; (57.3 -57.024)=0.276; (0.276 +2)=2.276f(t)=≈2.276f'(t)=3*(7.128)^2 -12*(7.128) -8≈3*(50.81) -85.536 -8≈152.43 -85.536 -8≈58.894Next iteration:t2 = t1 - f(t1)/f'(t1)=7.128 -2.276/58.894≈7.128 -0.0386≈7.0894Compute f(7.0894):t≈7.0894t^3≈7.0894^3≈7.0894*7.0894≈50.26*7.0894≈50.26*7 +50.26*0.0894≈351.82 +4.49≈356.31-6t^2≈-6*(50.26)= -301.56-8t≈-8*7.0894≈-56.715+2f(t)=356.31 -301.56 -56.715 +2≈(356.31 -301.56)=54.75; (54.75 -56.715)= -1.965; (-1.965 +2)=0.035Almost zero.f'(t)=3*(7.0894)^2 -12*(7.0894) -8≈3*(50.26) -85.07 -8≈150.78 -85.07 -8≈57.71Next iteration:t3 = t2 - f(t2)/f'(t2)=7.0894 -0.035/57.71≈7.0894 -0.0006≈7.0888Compute f(7.0888):t≈7.0888t^3≈7.0888^3≈7.0888*7.0888≈50.25*7.0888≈50.25*7 +50.25*0.0888≈351.75 +4.45≈356.2-6t^2≈-6*(50.25)= -301.5-8t≈-8*7.0888≈-56.71+2f(t)=356.2 -301.5 -56.71 +2≈(356.2 -301.5)=54.7; (54.7 -56.71)= -2.01; (-2.01 +2)= -0.01Almost zero.f'(t)=3*(7.0888)^2 -12*(7.0888) -8≈3*(50.25) -85.066 -8≈150.75 -85.066 -8≈57.684Next iteration:t4 = t3 - f(t3)/f'(t3)=7.0888 - (-0.01)/57.684≈7.0888 +0.00017≈7.08897Compute f(7.08897):t≈7.08897t^3≈7.08897^3≈7.08897*7.08897≈50.25*7.08897≈50.25*7 +50.25*0.08897≈351.75 +4.46≈356.21-6t^2≈-6*(50.25)= -301.5-8t≈-8*7.08897≈-56.7118+2f(t)=356.21 -301.5 -56.7118 +2≈(356.21 -301.5)=54.71; (54.71 -56.7118)= -2.0018; (-2.0018 +2)= -0.0018Almost zero.f'(t)=≈57.684Next iteration:t5 = t4 - f(t4)/f'(t4)=7.08897 - (-0.0018)/57.684≈7.08897 +0.000031≈7.0890So, the root is approximately t≈7.089 days.Therefore, the two times when h(t)=g(t) are approximately t≈0.216 days and t≈7.089 days.But let me check if these are within the interval 0≤t≤10. Yes, both are.So, the answers are t≈0.216 and t≈7.089.But let me see if the problem expects exact forms or decimal approximations.Given that the cubic doesn't factor nicely, exact forms would involve cube roots, which are messy. So, probably decimal approximations are acceptable.So, rounding to three decimal places:t≈0.216 and t≈7.089.Alternatively, maybe to two decimal places: t≈0.22 and t≈7.09.But let me check the exactness.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only one solution, but according to the analysis, there are two.But let me check the original functions again.Wait, at t=0, h(t)=5, g(t)=9. So, h(t) starts below g(t). Then, h(t) increases, crosses g(t) at t≈0.216, then continues to grow to its maximum at t≈5.13, then decreases, crossing g(t) again at t≈7.089.So, two crossing points.Therefore, the answer is t≈0.216 and t≈7.089.But the problem says \\"at what time t\\", which might imply both, but perhaps the question is expecting both answers.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.Wait, let me re-express the equation:h(t)=g(t)-2t^3 +15t^2 +4t +5 =3t^2 -12t +9Bring all terms to left:-2t^3 +12t^2 +16t -4=0Multiply by -1:2t^3 -12t^2 -16t +4=0Divide by 2:t^3 -6t^2 -8t +2=0Yes, that's correct.So, the equation is correct, and we have two real roots in the interval.Therefore, the answer is two times: approximately 0.216 and 7.089 days.But let me check if the problem expects both. The question is \\"at what time t\\", which could be interpreted as all times, so both.Therefore, the answers are t≈0.216 and t≈7.089.But to be precise, let me write them as fractions or exact decimals.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the exact form, but it's complicated.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only the later time, but according to the analysis, there are two.But let me see, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative earlier.Wait, in part 1, we found the maximum at t≈5.13, which is correct.In part 2, the two crossing points are correct.Therefore, the answers are:1. t=(15 + sqrt(249))/6 ≈5.13 days2. t≈0.216 and t≈7.089 daysBut let me check if the problem expects multiple answers for part 2.Looking back at the problem statement:\\"2. At what time ( t ) does the height of the first plant equal the height of the second plant within the interval ( 0 leq t leq 10 ).\\"It says \\"at what time t\\", which is singular, but the equation has two solutions. So, perhaps both are needed.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects only the later time, but according to the analysis, there are two.Therefore, I think the correct approach is to provide both times.So, summarizing:1. The plant reaches maximum height at t=(15 + sqrt(249))/6 days, approximately 5.13 days.2. The heights are equal at t≈0.216 days and t≈7.089 days.But let me check the exactness.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the exact forms.For part 1, t=(15 + sqrt(249))/6For part 2, the roots of t^3 -6t^2 -8t +2=0, which are t≈0.216 and t≈7.089.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answers in fractions or something, but given the roots are irrational, decimal approximations are acceptable.Therefore, final answers:1. t=(15 + sqrt(249))/6 ≈5.13 days2. t≈0.216 and t≈7.089 daysBut let me check if the problem expects both times for part 2.Yes, because the equation has two solutions in the interval.Therefore, the answers are:1. boxed{dfrac{15 + sqrt{249}}{6}} days2. boxed{0.216} days and boxed{7.089} daysBut since the problem asks for \\"at what time t\\", and it's within 0≤t≤10, both times are valid.Alternatively, if the problem expects a single answer, maybe only the later time, but according to the analysis, both are correct.But to be thorough, I think both should be reported.Therefore, the final answers are:1. The maximum height occurs at t=(15 + sqrt(249))/6 days, which is approximately 5.13 days.2. The heights are equal at approximately t=0.216 days and t=7.089 days.So, in boxed form:1. boxed{dfrac{15 + sqrt{249}}{6}}2. boxed{0.216} and boxed{7.089}But since the problem might expect both answers in one box for part 2, perhaps as a list.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the exact forms for part 2, but since they are roots of a cubic, it's complicated.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only the later time, but according to the analysis, both are correct.Therefore, I think the correct approach is to provide both times.So, final answers:1. boxed{dfrac{15 + sqrt{249}}{6}}2. boxed{0.216} and boxed{7.089}But to be precise, let me check the exact decimal places.For part 1, t=(15 + sqrt(249))/6sqrt(249)=15.78 approximately, so 15 +15.78=30.78, divided by 6≈5.13.So, t≈5.13.For part 2, t≈0.216 and t≈7.089.Alternatively, to three decimal places, t≈0.216 and t≈7.089.Alternatively, maybe to two decimal places: t≈0.22 and t≈7.09.But let me see, in the Newton-Raphson, we got t≈0.2162 and t≈7.089.So, to three decimal places, 0.216 and 7.089.Therefore, the final answers are:1. boxed{dfrac{15 + sqrt{249}}{6}} (approximately 5.13 days)2. boxed{0.216} and boxed{7.089} days"},{"question":"A social media influencer is collaborating with a grassroots organizer to raise awareness about an environmental campaign.

The influencer has ( x ) followers, and when they post about the campaign, 5% of these followers share the post.

Not integer.So, no luck with a=2, c=2 either.Hmm, maybe it doesn't factor nicely, so I might need to use numerical methods.Alternatively, maybe I can graph the function P(t) and see where it crosses 100.Alternatively, use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the root.Let me try that.The equation is 4t³ -9t² +6t -85=0.Let me denote f(t)=4t³ -9t² +6t -85.Compute f(3)=4*27 -9*9 +6*3 -85=108 -81 +18 -85= -40.f(4)=4*64 -9*16 +24 -85=256 -144 +24 -85=51.So between t=3 and t=4, f(t) goes from -40 to 51, so there's a root between 3 and 4.Compute f(3.5)=4*(42.875) -9*(12.25) +6*(3.5) -85.4*42.875=171.5, 9*12.25=110.25, 6*3.5=21.So 171.5 -110.25=61.25, +21=82.25, -85= -2.75.So f(3.5)= -2.75.So between t=3.5 and t=4, f(t) goes from -2.75 to 51.Compute f(3.75)=4*(52.734375) -9*(14.0625) +6*(3.75) -85.4*52.734375=210.9375, 9*14.0625=126.5625, 6*3.75=22.5.So 210.9375 -126.5625=84.375, +22.5=106.875, -85=21.875.So f(3.75)=21.875.So the root is between 3.5 and 3.75.Compute f(3.6)=4*(46.656) -9*(12.96) +6*(3.6) -85.4*46.656=186.624, 9*12.96=116.64, 6*3.6=21.6.So 186.624 -116.64=69.984, +21.6=91.584, -85=6.584.f(3.6)=6.584.So between 3.5 and 3.6, f(t) goes from -2.75 to 6.584.Compute f(3.55)=4*(44.918) -9*(12.6025) +6*(3.55) -85.Wait, maybe better to compute step by step.t=3.55:t³=3.55³≈44.918, t²≈12.6025.So 4*44.918≈179.672, 9*12.6025≈113.4225, 6*3.55≈21.3.So f(t)=179.672 -113.4225 +21.3 -85.179.672 -113.4225≈66.2495, +21.3≈87.5495, -85≈2.5495.So f(3.55)≈2.55.So between 3.5 and 3.55, f(t) goes from -2.75 to 2.55.Compute f(3.525)=?t=3.525.t²≈12.4256, t³≈43.854.So 4*43.854≈175.416, 9*12.4256≈111.8304, 6*3.525≈21.15.So f(t)=175.416 -111.8304 +21.15 -85.175.416 -111.8304≈63.5856, +21.15≈84.7356, -85≈-0.2644.So f(3.525)≈-0.2644.So between 3.525 and 3.55, f(t) goes from -0.2644 to 2.55.Compute f(3.5375)=?t=3.5375.t²≈12.513, t³≈44.207.4*44.207≈176.828, 9*12.513≈112.617, 6*3.5375≈21.225.f(t)=176.828 -112.617 +21.225 -85.176.828 -112.617≈64.211, +21.225≈85.436, -85≈0.436.So f(3.5375)≈0.436.So between 3.525 and 3.5375, f(t) goes from -0.2644 to 0.436.Compute f(3.53125)=?t=3.53125.t²≈12.467, t³≈44.035.4*44.035≈176.14, 9*12.467≈112.203, 6*3.53125≈21.1875.f(t)=176.14 -112.203 +21.1875 -85.176.14 -112.203≈63.937, +21.1875≈85.1245, -85≈0.1245.f(3.53125)≈0.1245.Between 3.525 and 3.53125, f(t) goes from -0.2644 to 0.1245.Compute f(3.528125)=?t=3.528125.t²≈12.445, t³≈44.003.4*44.003≈176.012, 9*12.445≈112.005, 6*3.528125≈21.16875.f(t)=176.012 -112.005 +21.16875 -85.176.012 -112.005≈64.007, +21.16875≈85.17575, -85≈0.17575.Wait, that can't be right because at 3.525, f(t) was -0.2644, and at 3.53125, it was 0.1245. So maybe I made a mistake in calculation.Wait, let me recalculate f(3.528125).t=3.528125.Compute t²: 3.528125².3.528125 * 3.528125.Let me compute 3.5²=12.25.0.028125²≈0.000791.Cross terms: 2*3.5*0.028125≈0.196875.So total t²≈12.25 +0.196875 +0.000791≈12.447666.t³= t²*t≈12.447666 *3.528125.Compute 12 *3.528125=42.3375.0.447666*3.528125≈1.577.So t³≈42.3375 +1.577≈43.9145.So 4t³≈4*43.9145≈175.658.9t²≈9*12.447666≈112.029.6t≈6*3.528125≈21.16875.So f(t)=175.658 -112.029 +21.16875 -85.175.658 -112.029≈63.629, +21.16875≈84.79775, -85≈-0.20225.So f(3.528125)≈-0.20225.Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. Maybe my approximation was off.Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for more accurate results, but since I'm doing this manually, let me try a different approach.Alternatively, use linear approximation between t=3.525 and t=3.53125.At t=3.525, f(t)≈-0.2644.At t=3.53125, f(t)≈0.1245.The difference in t is 0.00625, and the difference in f(t) is 0.1245 - (-0.2644)=0.3889.We want to find t where f(t)=0.So from t=3.525, need to cover 0.2644 to reach 0.So fraction=0.2644 /0.3889≈0.68.So t≈3.525 +0.68*0.00625≈3.525 +0.00425≈3.52925.So approximate root at t≈3.52925.Check f(3.52925):Compute t=3.52925.t²≈(3.52925)^2≈12.449.t³≈3.52925*12.449≈43.94.4t³≈175.76.9t²≈112.041.6t≈21.1755.So f(t)=175.76 -112.041 +21.1755 -85≈175.76 -112.041=63.719 +21.1755=84.8945 -85≈-0.1055.Hmm, still negative. So maybe the root is a bit higher.Alternatively, maybe I need more accurate calculations.Alternatively, perhaps use the Newton-Raphson method.Let me pick t₀=3.5.f(3.5)= -2.75.f’(t)=12t² -18t +6.At t=3.5, f’(3.5)=12*(12.25) -18*(3.5) +6=147 -63 +6=90.So next approximation: t₁= t₀ - f(t₀)/f’(t₀)=3.5 - (-2.75)/90≈3.5 +0.03055≈3.53055.Compute f(3.53055):t=3.53055.t²≈12.464.t³≈3.53055*12.464≈43.93.4t³≈175.72.9t²≈112.176.6t≈21.1833.f(t)=175.72 -112.176 +21.1833 -85≈175.72 -112.176=63.544 +21.1833=84.7273 -85≈-0.2727.Wait, that's worse. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.Wait, f(t)=4t³ -9t² +6t -85.At t=3.53055:Compute t³: 3.53055³.First, 3.5³=42.875.0.03055³≈0.000028.Cross terms: 3*(3.5)^2*0.03055≈3*12.25*0.03055≈1.123.So t³≈42.875 +1.123 +0.000028≈43.998.So 4t³≈175.992.9t²: t²=3.53055²≈12.464.9*12.464≈112.176.6t≈6*3.53055≈21.1833.So f(t)=175.992 -112.176 +21.1833 -85≈175.992 -112.176=63.816 +21.1833=85.0 -85=0.Wait, that's exactly zero? Hmm, maybe my approximation was too rough.Wait, actually, 175.992 -112.176=63.816, +21.1833=85.0, -85=0.So f(3.53055)=0.So the root is approximately t≈3.53055 years.So approximately 3.53 years.But since the question asks for the time t when processing power reaches exactly 100, and since it's a cubic, there might be only one real root, so t≈3.53 years.But let me check if there are other roots.Since it's a cubic, it can have up to three real roots, but given the behavior of the function, as t approaches infinity, P(t) approaches infinity, and as t approaches negative infinity, P(t) approaches negative infinity. So it must cross the x-axis at least once. But since we found one real root around 3.53, and the others might be complex or negative.But since time t is in years since inception, t must be positive. So the only relevant root is around 3.53 years.So the answer to part 1 is approximately t≈3.53 years.Now, moving on to part 2.We have E(t)=P(t)/(2t +3). So E(t)= (4t³ -9t² +6t +15)/(2t +3).We need to simplify this expression and find when it's undefined.First, to simplify, let's perform polynomial long division of P(t) by (2t +3).Divide 4t³ -9t² +6t +15 by 2t +3.Set it up:Divide 4t³ -9t² +6t +15 by 2t +3.First term: 4t³ /2t=2t².Multiply (2t +3) by 2t²: 4t³ +6t².Subtract from P(t):(4t³ -9t² +6t +15) - (4t³ +6t²)= (-15t² +6t +15).Next term: -15t² /2t= -7.5t. Hmm, but we prefer integer coefficients, so maybe factor out a 3.Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.Wait, let me try synthetic division.Alternatively, let me see if (2t +3) is a factor of P(t). If so, then E(t) would be a polynomial.Let me check P(-3/2):P(-3/2)=4*(-3/2)^3 -9*(-3/2)^2 +6*(-3/2)+15.Compute each term:4*(-27/8)= -108/8= -13.5.-9*(9/4)= -81/4= -20.25.6*(-3/2)= -9.So total: -13.5 -20.25 -9 +15= (-13.5 -20.25)= -33.75, -9= -42.75, +15= -27.75≠0.So (2t +3) is not a factor, so E(t) cannot be simplified to a polynomial, but we can perform the division to express it as a polynomial plus a remainder over (2t +3).Let me proceed with the division.Divide 4t³ -9t² +6t +15 by 2t +3.First term: 4t³ /2t=2t².Multiply (2t +3) by 2t²: 4t³ +6t².Subtract: (4t³ -9t² +6t +15) - (4t³ +6t²)= (-15t² +6t +15).Next term: -15t² /2t= -7.5t. Hmm, fractional coefficient. Maybe factor out a 3.Alternatively, let me write it as -15t² /2t= -15/2 t.Multiply (2t +3) by -15/2 t: -15t² - (45/2)t.Subtract: (-15t² +6t +15) - (-15t² -22.5t)= (0t² +28.5t +15).Next term: 28.5t /2t=14.25.Multiply (2t +3) by 14.25: 28.5t +42.75.Subtract: (28.5t +15) - (28.5t +42.75)= (0t -27.75).So the division gives:2t² - (15/2)t +14.25 + (-27.75)/(2t +3).But we can write this as:2t² - (15/2)t +57/4 - (111/4)/(2t +3).Wait, let me check:Wait, 14.25 is 57/4, and -27.75 is -111/4.So E(t)= (4t³ -9t² +6t +15)/(2t +3)=2t² - (15/2)t +57/4 - (111/4)/(2t +3).Alternatively, to write it as a polynomial plus a proper fraction:E(t)=2t² - (15/2)t +57/4 - (111/4)/(2t +3).But maybe we can write it as:E(t)=2t² - (15/2)t +57/4 - (111)/(4(2t +3)).Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.But since (2t +3) is not a factor, the expression is already simplified as much as possible.Now, E(t) is undefined when the denominator is zero, i.e., when 2t +3=0 => t= -3/2.But since t represents time in years since inception, t must be ≥0. So in the context of the problem, E(t) is undefined at t= -1.5, which is not in the domain of t≥0. So for t≥0, E(t) is defined everywhere.But the question asks for the values of t for which E(t) is undefined, regardless of context. So t= -3/2.So to summarize:1. The time t when P(t)=100 is approximately 3.53 years.2. E(t) simplifies to 2t² - (15/2)t +57/4 - (111)/(4(2t +3)), and it's undefined at t= -3/2.But let me check the division again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.Wait, when I did the division earlier, I had:After first term: 2t².Multiply (2t +3) by 2t²: 4t³ +6t².Subtract: (4t³ -9t² +6t +15) - (4t³ +6t²)= -15t² +6t +15.Next term: -15t² /2t= -7.5t.Multiply (2t +3) by -7.5t: -15t² -22.5t.Subtract: (-15t² +6t +15) - (-15t² -22.5t)= 28.5t +15.Next term: 28.5t /2t=14.25.Multiply (2t +3) by14.25:28.5t +42.75.Subtract: (28.5t +15) - (28.5t +42.75)= -27.75.So the division is correct.So E(t)=2t² -7.5t +14.25 -27.75/(2t +3).Alternatively, to write it with fractions:2t² - (15/2)t +57/4 - (111/4)/(2t +3).Yes, that's correct.So the simplified form is 2t² - (15/2)t +57/4 - (111)/(4(2t +3)).And E(t) is undefined when 2t +3=0 => t= -3/2.So that's the answer."},{"question":"Alex is organizing a networking event designed to connect people from different professional backgrounds.

To achieve this, the expert uses a combination of speakers, each contributing to different frequency ranges.

The expert is using a polynomial function to model the output power, P(x) = 2x³ - 5x² + 4x - 3, where x is the input voltage in volts. There are two parts to the problem: first, finding the voltage levels that result in zero power output, which means finding the real roots of the equation 2x³ - 5x² + 4x - 3 = 0. Second, determining the range of voltage levels that ensure the power output is at least 12 watts, so solving the inequality 2x³ - 5x² + 4x - 3 ≥ 12.Starting with the first part: finding the real roots of the polynomial equation. I remember that for polynomials, especially cubic ones, there are a few methods to find roots, like factoring, using the Rational Root Theorem, synthetic division, or maybe even graphing. Since it's a cubic, there should be at least one real root, and up to three real roots.First, I'll try the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient. The constant term here is -3, and the leading coefficient is 2. So possible rational roots are ±1, ±3, ±1/2, ±3/2.Let me test these one by one by plugging them into the polynomial.Testing x = 1: P(1) = 2(1)³ - 5(1)² + 4(1) - 3 = 2 - 5 + 4 - 3 = -2. Not zero.Testing x = -1: P(-1) = 2(-1)³ - 5(-1)² + 4(-1) - 3 = -2 - 5 - 4 - 3 = -14. Not zero.Testing x = 3: P(3) = 2(27) - 5(9) + 4(3) - 3 = 54 - 45 + 12 - 3 = 18. Not zero.Testing x = -3: P(-3) = 2(-27) - 5(9) + 4(-3) - 3 = -54 - 45 - 12 - 3 = -114. Not zero.Testing x = 1/2: P(1/2) = 2*(1/8) - 5*(1/4) + 4*(1/2) - 3 = 0.25 - 1.25 + 2 - 3 = (0.25 - 1.25) + (2 - 3) = (-1) + (-1) = -2. Not zero.Testing x = -1/2: P(-1/2) = 2*(-1/8) - 5*(1/4) + 4*(-1/2) - 3 = -0.25 - 1.25 - 2 - 3 = (-0.25 - 1.25) + (-2 - 3) = (-1.5) + (-5) = -6.5. Not zero.Testing x = 3/2: P(3/2) = 2*(27/8) - 5*(9/4) + 4*(3/2) - 3. Let's compute each term:2*(27/8) = 54/8 = 6.75-5*(9/4) = -45/4 = -11.254*(3/2) = 12/2 = 6-3 remains as is.Adding them up: 6.75 - 11.25 + 6 - 3 = (6.75 - 11.25) + (6 - 3) = (-4.5) + 3 = -1.5. Not zero.Testing x = -3/2: P(-3/2) = 2*(-27/8) - 5*(9/4) + 4*(-3/2) - 3.2*(-27/8) = -54/8 = -6.75-5*(9/4) = -45/4 = -11.254*(-3/2) = -12/2 = -6-3 remains.Adding them up: -6.75 - 11.25 - 6 - 3 = (-6.75 - 11.25) + (-6 - 3) = (-18) + (-9) = -27. Not zero.Hmm, none of the rational roots worked. That means this polynomial doesn't have any rational roots, so I can't factor it easily using the Rational Root Theorem. Maybe I need to use another method, like factoring by grouping or using the cubic formula. Alternatively, I can try to find approximate roots using methods like the Newton-Raphson method or graphing.Alternatively, since it's a cubic, I can try to see if it can be factored into a product of a linear term and a quadratic, but since I can't find a rational root, maybe I need to use synthetic division or something else. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations? Let me double-check one of them.Let me test x = 1 again: 2(1) - 5(1) + 4(1) - 3 = 2 - 5 + 4 - 3 = (2 - 5) + (4 - 3) = (-3) + (1) = -2. Correct.x = 3: 2(27) - 5(9) + 4(3) - 3 = 54 - 45 + 12 - 3 = (54 - 45) + (12 - 3) = 9 + 9 = 18. Correct.x = 1/2: 2*(1/8) = 0.25; -5*(1/4) = -1.25; 4*(1/2) = 2; -3. So 0.25 -1.25 + 2 -3 = (-1) + (-1) = -2. Correct.Hmm, so no rational roots. Maybe I need to use the cubic formula or numerical methods. Alternatively, I can try to factor it as a product of a linear and quadratic term, but since I don't know the root, it's tricky.Alternatively, maybe I can graph the function to estimate the roots. Let me think about the behavior of the cubic function.As x approaches positive infinity, the leading term 2x³ dominates, so P(x) tends to positive infinity. As x approaches negative infinity, 2x³ tends to negative infinity, so P(x) tends to negative infinity. Therefore, since it's a continuous function, it must cross the x-axis at least once.Let me evaluate P(x) at some points to see where it crosses zero.We already saw that P(1) = -2, P(2): let's compute P(2) = 2*(8) -5*(4) +4*(2) -3 = 16 -20 +8 -3 = (16 -20) + (8 -3) = (-4) +5 = 1. So P(2) = 1.So between x=1 and x=2, P(x) goes from -2 to 1, so by Intermediate Value Theorem, there's a root between 1 and 2.Similarly, let's check P(0): 0 -0 +0 -3 = -3.P(1) = -2, P(2)=1.So between 1 and 2, it crosses from negative to positive.What about P(3)=18, which is positive. So only one real root? Or maybe more.Wait, let's check P(-1) = -14, which is negative. P(0) = -3, still negative. P(1)=-2, still negative. P(2)=1, positive. So only one real root between 1 and 2? Or maybe more.Wait, let's check P(1.5): x=1.5.P(1.5) = 2*(3.375) -5*(2.25) +4*(1.5) -3 = 6.75 -11.25 +6 -3 = (6.75 -11.25) + (6 -3) = (-4.5) +3 = -1.5.So P(1.5) = -1.5.So between x=1.5 and x=2, P(x) goes from -1.5 to 1, so another root there.Wait, but we already had a root between 1 and 2. Wait, no, actually, between 1 and 2, P(x) goes from -2 to 1, so only one crossing. But P(1.5) is -1.5, so it's still negative. So the root is between 1.5 and 2.Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute P(1.75):x=1.75.P(1.75) = 2*(1.75)^3 -5*(1.75)^2 +4*(1.75) -3.Compute each term:1.75³ = 1.75*1.75=3.0625; 3.0625*1.75=5.359375.So 2*5.359375=10.71875.1.75²=3.0625. So -5*3.0625= -15.3125.4*1.75=7.So adding up: 10.71875 -15.3125 +7 -3.Compute step by step:10.71875 -15.3125 = -4.59375-4.59375 +7 = 2.406252.40625 -3 = -0.59375.So P(1.75) ≈ -0.59375.Still negative.Next, x=1.8:1.8³=5.832; 2*5.832=11.6641.8²=3.24; -5*3.24=-16.24*1.8=7.2So total: 11.664 -16.2 +7.2 -3.11.664 -16.2 = -4.536-4.536 +7.2 = 2.6642.664 -3 = -0.336.Still negative.x=1.85:1.85³ ≈ 1.85*1.85=3.4225; 3.4225*1.85≈6.3391252*6.339125≈12.678251.85²≈3.4225; -5*3.4225≈-17.11254*1.85=7.4So total: 12.67825 -17.1125 +7.4 -3.12.67825 -17.1125 ≈ -4.43425-4.43425 +7.4 ≈ 2.965752.96575 -3 ≈ -0.03425.Almost zero. So P(1.85)≈-0.03425.x=1.86:1.86³≈1.86*1.86=3.4596; 3.4596*1.86≈6.43032*6.4303≈12.86061.86²≈3.4596; -5*3.4596≈-17.2984*1.86≈7.44Total: 12.8606 -17.298 +7.44 -3.12.8606 -17.298≈-4.4374-4.4374 +7.44≈3.00263.0026 -3≈0.0026.So P(1.86)≈0.0026, which is just above zero.So the root is between 1.85 and 1.86. Using linear approximation:Between x=1.85, P=-0.03425x=1.86, P=0.0026The difference in x is 0.01, and the difference in P is 0.0026 - (-0.03425)=0.03685.We need to find x where P=0. So from x=1.85, need to cover 0.03425 to reach zero.Fraction: 0.03425 / 0.03685 ≈0.929.So x≈1.85 + 0.929*0.01≈1.85 +0.00929≈1.8593.So approximately 1.8593 volts.Is that the only real root? Let's check the behavior for x >2.P(2)=1, P(3)=18, so it's increasing. What about for x <1?P(0)=-3, P(1)=-2. So it's increasing from x=0 to x=1, but still negative.Wait, maybe there's another root somewhere else.Wait, let's check x= -1: P(-1)=-14, which is negative.x= -2: P(-2)=2*(-8) -5*(4) +4*(-2) -3= -16 -20 -8 -3= -47. Negative.So the function is negative at x=-2, x=-1, x=0, x=1, and then becomes positive at x=2. So only one real root between 1.85 and 1.86.Wait, but cubic functions can have up to three real roots. Maybe there are two more complex roots, but since the polynomial has real coefficients, complex roots come in pairs. So if there's one real root, the other two are complex conjugates.Therefore, the only real root is approximately 1.8593 volts.Wait, but let me confirm. Maybe I missed something.Alternatively, maybe I can factor the polynomial as (x - a)(quadratic). Since I have one real root, I can perform polynomial division.Let me use synthetic division with the root x≈1.8593, but that's messy. Alternatively, maybe I can use the depressed cubic formula.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the derivative to check for turning points.Compute P'(x)=6x² -10x +4.Set P'(x)=0: 6x² -10x +4=0.Using quadratic formula: x=(10±sqrt(100 - 96))/12=(10±2)/12.So x=(10+2)/12=12/12=1, and x=(10-2)/12=8/12=2/3≈0.6667.So critical points at x=1 and x≈0.6667.So the function has a local maximum at x≈0.6667 and a local minimum at x=1.Compute P(0.6667): Let's compute P(2/3).P(2/3)=2*(8/27) -5*(4/9) +4*(2/3) -3.Compute each term:2*(8/27)=16/27≈0.5926-5*(4/9)= -20/9≈-2.22224*(2/3)=8/3≈2.6667-3.Adding up: 0.5926 -2.2222 +2.6667 -3 ≈ (0.5926 -2.2222) + (2.6667 -3) ≈ (-1.6296) + (-0.3333)≈-1.9629.So P(2/3)≈-1.9629.And P(1)= -2.So the function decreases from x=0 to x≈0.6667, reaching a local maximum at x≈0.6667, then decreases to a local minimum at x=1, then increases beyond x=1.So since P(1)= -2, and P(2)=1, the function crosses zero once between x=1 and x=2.Therefore, only one real root, approximately 1.8593 volts.So for part 1, the voltage level that results in zero power output is approximately 1.859 volts.Now, moving on to part 2: determining the range of voltage levels where the power output is at least 12 watts. So solving 2x³ -5x² +4x -3 ≥12.First, let's rewrite the inequality:2x³ -5x² +4x -3 -12 ≥0Simplify: 2x³ -5x² +4x -15 ≥0.So we need to solve 2x³ -5x² +4x -15 ≥0.Again, this is a cubic equation. Let's denote Q(x)=2x³ -5x² +4x -15.We need to find the values of x where Q(x) ≥0.First, let's find the real roots of Q(x)=0, because the sign of Q(x) can change at its roots.Again, trying Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 15 over factors of 2: ±1, ±3, ±5, ±15, ±1/2, ±3/2, ±5/2, ±15/2.Testing x=1: Q(1)=2 -5 +4 -15= -14. Not zero.x=3: Q(3)=54 -45 +12 -15=6. Not zero.x=5: Q(5)=250 -125 +20 -15=130. Not zero.x=1/2: Q(1/2)=2*(1/8) -5*(1/4) +4*(1/2) -15=0.25 -1.25 +2 -15= (-1) + (-13)= -14. Not zero.x=3/2: Q(3/2)=2*(27/8) -5*(9/4) +4*(3/2) -15=54/8 -45/4 +6 -15.Convert to eighths:54/8 -90/8 +48/8 -120/8= (54 -90 +48 -120)/8=(54+48)-(90+120)=102-210= -108/8= -13.5. Not zero.x=5/2: Q(5/2)=2*(125/8) -5*(25/4) +4*(5/2) -15=250/8 -125/4 +10 -15.Convert to eighths:250/8 -250/8 +80/8 -120/8= (250 -250 +80 -120)/8= (-40)/8= -5. Not zero.x= -1: Q(-1)= -2 -5 -4 -15= -26. Not zero.x= -3: Q(-3)= -54 -45 -12 -15= -126. Not zero.x=15/2: That's 7.5. Q(7.5)=2*(421.875) -5*(56.25) +4*(7.5) -15=843.75 -281.25 +30 -15= (843.75 -281.25)=562.5; 562.5 +30=592.5; 592.5 -15=577.5. Not zero.Hmm, none of the rational roots work. So again, we might need to use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.Alternatively, let's analyze the behavior of Q(x).As x approaches positive infinity, Q(x) tends to positive infinity. As x approaches negative infinity, Q(x) tends to negative infinity. So it must cross the x-axis at least once.Let's evaluate Q(x) at some points.Q(2)=16 -20 +8 -15= -11.Q(3)=54 -45 +12 -15=6.So between x=2 and x=3, Q(x) goes from -11 to 6, so crosses zero somewhere there.Q(2.5)=2*(15.625) -5*(6.25) +4*(2.5) -15=31.25 -31.25 +10 -15= (31.25 -31.25) + (10 -15)=0 -5= -5.So Q(2.5)= -5.Q(2.75)=2*(20.796875) -5*(7.5625) +4*(2.75) -15≈41.59375 -37.8125 +11 -15.Compute step by step:41.59375 -37.8125=3.781253.78125 +11=14.7812514.78125 -15≈-0.21875.So Q(2.75)≈-0.21875.Q(2.8)=2*(21.952) -5*(7.84) +4*(2.8) -15≈43.904 -39.2 +11.2 -15.Compute:43.904 -39.2=4.7044.704 +11.2=15.90415.904 -15=0.904.So Q(2.8)≈0.904.Therefore, between x=2.75 and x=2.8, Q(x) crosses from negative to positive. So the real root is between 2.75 and 2.8.Using linear approximation:At x=2.75, Q≈-0.21875At x=2.8, Q≈0.904Difference in x: 0.05Difference in Q: 0.904 - (-0.21875)=1.12275We need to find x where Q=0.Fraction: 0.21875 /1.12275≈0.1948.So x≈2.75 +0.1948*0.05≈2.75 +0.00974≈2.7597.So approximately 2.7597 volts.Is there another real root? Let's check.Compute Q(1)= -14, Q(2)= -11, Q(3)=6.So between x=2 and x=3, only one crossing.What about for x <2?Q(0)= -15.Q(1)= -14.Q(2)= -11.So Q(x) is negative from x=0 to x=2, then crosses zero at x≈2.7597, and then becomes positive.Wait, but let's check Q(x) for x <0.Q(-1)= -26, Q(-2)= -54 -20 -8 -15= -97.So it's negative for x negative.Therefore, Q(x)=0 has only one real root at x≈2.7597.Therefore, the inequality Q(x) ≥0 is satisfied when x ≥2.7597.But wait, let's check the behavior beyond x=2.7597.Since it's a cubic with positive leading coefficient, after the root at x≈2.7597, Q(x) increases to infinity. So for x ≥2.7597, Q(x) ≥0.But wait, let's check Q(4)=2*64 -5*16 +4*4 -15=128 -80 +16 -15= (128 -80)=48; 48 +16=64; 64 -15=49>0.Yes, so for x ≥≈2.7597, Q(x) ≥0.But wait, let's also check if there are any other roots. Since it's a cubic, it can have up to three real roots. But we only found one. So maybe the other two are complex.Therefore, the inequality 2x³ -5x² +4x -15 ≥0 is satisfied for x ≥ approximately 2.7597 volts.But let me confirm by testing a value just above 2.7597, say x=2.8: Q(2.8)=0.904>0.And a value just below, say x=2.75: Q(2.75)= -0.21875<0.So yes, the inequality holds for x ≥≈2.7597.But wait, let's also check if there's a local maximum or minimum that might cause Q(x) to dip below zero again.Compute Q'(x)=6x² -10x +4.Set to zero: 6x² -10x +4=0.Solutions: x=(10±sqrt(100-96))/12=(10±2)/12=1 or 2/3≈0.6667.So critical points at x=1 and x≈0.6667.Compute Q(1)= -14, Q(0.6667)= let's compute Q(2/3):Q(2/3)=2*(8/27) -5*(4/9) +4*(2/3) -15≈0.5926 -2.2222 +2.6667 -15≈-14. So Q(x) has a local maximum at x≈0.6667, but it's still negative, and a local minimum at x=1, which is also negative.Therefore, the function Q(x) is increasing from x=1 onwards, crossing zero at x≈2.7597, and then increasing to infinity.Therefore, the solution to Q(x) ≥0 is x ≥≈2.7597 volts.But let me check if there's a possibility of another root beyond x=2.7597. Since it's a cubic, after the root, it goes to infinity, so no other roots.Therefore, the range of voltage levels that satisfy P(x) ≥12 watts is x ≥ approximately 2.7597 volts.But let me express this more accurately. Since we approximated the root as 2.7597, but perhaps we can find a better approximation.Using Newton-Raphson method on Q(x)=2x³ -5x² +4x -15.Let me take x₀=2.7597.Compute Q(x₀)=2*(2.7597)^3 -5*(2.7597)^2 +4*(2.7597) -15.First, compute 2.7597³≈2.7597*2.7597≈7.614; 7.614*2.7597≈20.99.So 2*20.99≈41.98.2.7597²≈7.614.-5*7.614≈-38.07.4*2.7597≈11.0388.So total: 41.98 -38.07 +11.0388 -15≈(41.98 -38.07)=3.91; 3.91 +11.0388≈14.9488; 14.9488 -15≈-0.0512.So Q(x₀)=≈-0.0512.Compute Q'(x)=6x² -10x +4.At x=2.7597, Q'(x)=6*(7.614) -10*(2.7597) +4≈45.684 -27.597 +4≈22.087.So next approximation: x₁=x₀ - Q(x₀)/Q'(x₀)=2.7597 - (-0.0512)/22.087≈2.7597 +0.0023≈2.762.Compute Q(2.762):2*(2.762)^3 -5*(2.762)^2 +4*(2.762) -15.Compute 2.762³≈2.762*2.762≈7.627; 7.627*2.762≈21.04.2*21.04≈42.08.2.762²≈7.627.-5*7.627≈-38.135.4*2.762≈11.048.Total: 42.08 -38.135 +11.048 -15≈(42.08 -38.135)=3.945; 3.945 +11.048≈14.993; 14.993 -15≈-0.007.So Q(2.762)=≈-0.007.Compute Q'(2.762)=6*(7.627) -10*(2.762) +4≈45.762 -27.62 +4≈22.142.Next iteration: x₂=2.762 - (-0.007)/22.142≈2.762 +0.000316≈2.7623.Compute Q(2.7623):2*(2.7623)^3 -5*(2.7623)^2 +4*(2.7623) -15.Approximate:2.7623³≈2.7623*2.7623≈7.629; 7.629*2.7623≈21.05.2*21.05≈42.10.2.7623²≈7.629.-5*7.629≈-38.145.4*2.7623≈11.049.Total: 42.10 -38.145 +11.049 -15≈(42.10 -38.145)=3.955; 3.955 +11.049≈15.004; 15.004 -15≈0.004.So Q(2.7623)=≈0.004.So now, between x=2.762 and x=2.7623, Q(x) crosses from -0.007 to +0.004.Using linear approximation:From x=2.762 (Q=-0.007) to x=2.7623 (Q=0.004). The difference in x is 0.0003, and the difference in Q is 0.011.We need to find x where Q=0.Fraction: 0.007 /0.011≈0.636.So x≈2.762 +0.636*0.0003≈2.762 +0.00019≈2.76219.So approximately 2.7622 volts.Therefore, the real root is approximately 2.7622 volts.Thus, the inequality 2x³ -5x² +4x -15 ≥0 is satisfied for x ≥≈2.7622 volts.So, summarizing:1. The voltage level that results in zero power output is approximately 1.859 volts.2. The range of voltage levels that ensure the power output is at least 12 watts is x ≥≈2.762 volts.But let me check if there's a possibility of another root beyond x=2.7622. Since the cubic tends to infinity, and we've found only one real root, there are no other real roots. Therefore, the inequality holds for x ≥≈2.7622.So, to present the answers:1. The real root is approximately 1.859 volts.2. The voltage levels must be at least approximately 2.762 volts.But let me check if the problem expects exact values or if it's okay with approximate decimal values.Since the polynomial doesn't factor nicely, and the roots are irrational, approximate decimal values are acceptable.Therefore, the answers are:1. x ≈1.859 volts.2. x ≥≈2.762 volts.But to express them more precisely, maybe to three decimal places.So, 1.859 and 2.762.Alternatively, if more precision is needed, but probably three decimal places are sufficient.So, final answers:1. The voltage level is approximately 1.859 volts.2. The voltage levels must be at least approximately 2.762 volts.**Final Answer**1. The voltage level resulting in zero power output is boxed{1.86} volts.2. The range of voltage levels for at least 12 watts is boxed{[2.76, infty)} volts."},{"question":"A curriculum director is planning the budget allocation for two new educational programs, A and B, to improve qualitative-focused learning outcomes. The total budget available is 150,000.1. Program A requires twice the amount of funding as Program B. If the total cost of both programs is equal to the available budget, set up and solve a system of linear equations to determine how much funding each program receives.2. In addition, the director wants to invest in digital resources to support both programs. The cost of these resources is represented by a quadratic expression ( C(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 20 ), where ( x ) is the number of resource units purchased. To stay within the budget, the director can only spend up to 10,000 on digital resources. Determine the range of resource units ( x ) that can be purchased by solving the inequality ( C(x) leq 10,000 ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a curriculum director is planning the budget for two programs, A and B. The total budget is 150,000. First, I need to figure out how much each program gets. The problem says that Program A requires twice the amount of funding as Program B. So, if I let the amount for Program B be some variable, say, B, then Program A would be 2B. So, the total cost of both programs is equal to the available budget, which is 150,000. That means A + B = 150,000. But since A is twice B, I can substitute that in. So, 2B + B = 150,000. That simplifies to 3B = 150,000. To find B, I divide both sides by 3. So, B = 150,000 / 3. Let me calculate that: 150,000 divided by 3 is 50,000. So, Program B gets 50,000. Then, Program A, being twice that, would be 2 * 50,000 = 100,000. Wait, let me double-check that. If A is 100,000 and B is 50,000, together they add up to 150,000, which matches the total budget. Okay, that seems right.Now, moving on to the second part. The director wants to invest in digital resources, and the cost is given by the quadratic expression C(x) = 3x² - 12x + 20, where x is the number of resource units. The director can only spend up to 10,000 on these resources. So, I need to solve the inequality 3x² - 12x + 20 ≤ 10,000.First, let me rewrite the inequality to make it easier to solve. Subtract 10,000 from both sides to get 3x² - 12x + 20 - 10,000 ≤ 0. That simplifies to 3x² - 12x - 9,980 ≤ 0.Hmm, that's a quadratic inequality. To solve this, I should first find the roots of the equation 3x² - 12x - 9,980 = 0. Then, I can determine the intervals where the quadratic expression is less than or equal to zero.Let me use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). In this equation, a = 3, b = -12, and c = -9,980.Calculating the discriminant first: b² - 4ac = (-12)² - 4 * 3 * (-9,980). That's 144 - 4 * 3 * (-9,980). Wait, 4 * 3 is 12, and 12 * (-9,980) is -119,760. So, the discriminant is 144 - (-119,760) which is 144 + 119,760 = 119,904.Now, taking the square root of 119,904. Let me see, 346 squared is 119,716 because 300² is 90,000, 40² is 1,600, 6² is 36, and cross terms would add up. Wait, 346² is 346*346. Let me calculate that:346 * 346:First, 300 * 300 = 90,000300 * 46 = 13,80046 * 300 = 13,80046 * 46 = 2,116So, adding them up: 90,000 + 13,800 + 13,800 + 2,116 = 90,000 + 27,600 + 2,116 = 119,716.But the discriminant is 119,904, which is 119,904 - 119,716 = 188 more. So, sqrt(119,904) is 346 + sqrt(188)/something? Wait, maybe I miscalculated.Alternatively, maybe I can factor it differently. Let me see, 119,904 divided by 16 is 7,494. Hmm, 7,494 divided by 4 is 1,873.5, which isn't an integer. Maybe 119,904 is 346.2 squared? Let me check 346.2²:346² is 119,716, as above. 0.2² is 0.04, and 2*346*0.2 is 138.4. So, 346.2² = 119,716 + 138.4 + 0.04 = 119,854.44. Still less than 119,904.Wait, maybe I should use a calculator here, but since I don't have one, perhaps I can note that 346.5² is (346 + 0.5)² = 346² + 2*346*0.5 + 0.25 = 119,716 + 346 + 0.25 = 120,062.25. That's higher than 119,904.So, sqrt(119,904) is between 346.2 and 346.5. Let me approximate it as 346.3. Let's see, 346.3² = ?346² = 119,7162*346*0.3 = 207.60.3² = 0.09So, 346.3² = 119,716 + 207.6 + 0.09 = 119,923.69. Hmm, that's still higher than 119,904. Wait, 346.2² was 119,854.44, and 346.3² is 119,923.69. So, 119,904 is between those. Let me compute 346.25²:346.25² = (346 + 0.25)² = 346² + 2*346*0.25 + 0.25² = 119,716 + 173 + 0.0625 = 119,889.0625.Still less than 119,904. Next, 346.3² is 119,923.69, which is higher. So, the square root is between 346.25 and 346.3.Compute 346.25 + (119,904 - 119,889.0625)/(119,923.69 - 119,889.0625). Difference between 119,904 and 119,889.0625 is 14.9375.Difference between 119,923.69 and 119,889.0625 is 34.6275.So, the fraction is 14.9375 / 34.6275 ≈ 0.431.So, sqrt(119,904) ≈ 346.25 + 0.431*(0.05) ≈ 346.25 + 0.02155 ≈ 346.27155.So, approximately 346.27.So, going back to the quadratic formula:x = [12 ± 346.27] / (2*3) = [12 ± 346.27]/6.Calculating both roots:First root: (12 + 346.27)/6 ≈ 358.27 / 6 ≈ 59.71.Second root: (12 - 346.27)/6 ≈ (-334.27)/6 ≈ -55.71.So, the roots are approximately x ≈ 59.71 and x ≈ -55.71.Since x represents the number of resource units, it can't be negative. So, we only consider the positive root, which is approximately 59.71.Now, the quadratic expression 3x² - 12x - 9,980 is a parabola opening upwards because the coefficient of x² is positive. Therefore, the expression is ≤ 0 between the two roots. But since one root is negative and the other is positive, the expression is ≤ 0 for x between -55.71 and 59.71.But since x can't be negative, the valid range is from 0 to approximately 59.71. Since x has to be an integer (you can't purchase a fraction of a resource unit), the maximum number of units is 59.Wait, but let me check if x=59 satisfies the inequality. Let me plug x=59 into C(x):C(59) = 3*(59)^2 - 12*(59) + 20.Calculate 59 squared: 59*59 is 3,481.Multiply by 3: 3*3,481 = 10,443.Then, 12*59 = 708.So, C(59) = 10,443 - 708 + 20 = 10,443 - 708 is 9,735; 9,735 + 20 is 9,755.Which is less than 10,000. So, 59 units cost 9,755.What about x=60? Let's compute C(60):60 squared is 3,600.3*3,600 = 10,800.12*60 = 720.C(60) = 10,800 - 720 + 20 = 10,800 - 720 is 10,080; 10,080 + 20 is 10,100.Which is more than 10,000. So, x=60 is too much.Therefore, the maximum integer value of x is 59. So, the range of x is from 0 to 59.But the problem says \\"the range of resource units x that can be purchased.\\" So, x can be any integer from 0 up to 59, inclusive.Wait, but the quadratic inequality was 3x² - 12x - 9,980 ≤ 0, which we found to be true for x between approximately -55.71 and 59.71. Since x must be a non-negative integer, x can be 0,1,2,...,59.So, the range is 0 ≤ x ≤ 59.But just to make sure, let me check x=59 and x=60 again.At x=59: C(59)=9,755 ≤10,000: yes.At x=60: C(60)=10,100 >10,000: no.So, x can be up to 59.So, summarizing:1. Program A gets 100,000 and Program B gets 50,000.2. The number of resource units that can be purchased is from 0 to 59.**Final Answer**1. Program A receives boxed{100000} dollars and Program B receives boxed{50000} dollars.2. The range of resource units ( x ) that can be purchased is boxed{[0, 59]}."},{"question":"As an experienced ceramicist, you are designing a new ceramic piece that incorporates a digital display. The ceramic piece is shaped like a paraboloid, which can be represented by the quadratic equation ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ), where ( z ) is the height in centimeters, and ( x ) and ( y ) are the horizontal and vertical dimensions, respectively. 1. If the ceramic piece needs to have a maximum height of 25 cm when ( x = 3 ) cm and ( y = 2 ) cm, determine the values of ( a ) and ( b ) given that the relationship between ( a ) and ( b ) is ( a = 2b ).2. You are planning to include a digital display at the top of the ceramic piece, which has a circular base. If the diameter of the circular base must be 10 cm, calculate the range of possible values for ( x ) and ( y ) that satisfy the equation of the paraboloid at this height.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about designing a ceramic piece shaped like a paraboloid. It's represented by the equation ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ). The first part asks me to find the values of ( a ) and ( b ) given that the maximum height is 25 cm when ( x = 3 ) cm and ( y = 2 ) cm, and also that ( a = 2b ). Okay, let's break this down. The maximum height occurs at a specific point, which is given as ( x = 3 ) and ( y = 2 ). So plugging those values into the equation should give me ( z = 25 ). So substituting, I get:[ 25 = a(3)^2 + b(2)^2 ]Simplifying that:[ 25 = 9a + 4b ]But I also know that ( a = 2b ). So I can substitute ( 2b ) in place of ( a ) in the equation:[ 25 = 9(2b) + 4b ]Calculating that:[ 25 = 18b + 4b ][ 25 = 22b ]So, solving for ( b ):[ b = frac{25}{22} ]Which is approximately 1.136 cm⁻¹. Then, since ( a = 2b ), plugging that in:[ a = 2 times frac{25}{22} = frac{50}{22} = frac{25}{11} ]Which is approximately 2.273 cm⁻¹. Wait, let me double-check that. If ( a = 2b ), and ( b = 25/22 ), then ( a = 50/22 ), which simplifies to 25/11. Yeah, that seems right. So, part 1 is done. I think I got ( a = frac{25}{11} ) and ( b = frac{25}{22} ). Moving on to part 2. I need to include a digital display at the top, which has a circular base with a diameter of 10 cm. So, the radius is 5 cm. I need to find the range of possible values for ( x ) and ( y ) that satisfy the paraboloid equation at this height. Wait, the circular base is at the top, which is the maximum height, right? So the height ( z ) is 25 cm. So, I need to find all ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( z = 25 ). But since the display is circular, it's symmetric around the center. So, I think the display will have a radius of 5 cm, meaning that the distance from the center (which is at ( x = 0 ), ( y = 0 )) to the edge is 5 cm. But wait, in the equation ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ), the shape is a paraboloid, so at height ( z = 25 ), the cross-section is an ellipse, not necessarily a circle. But the display is a circle, so maybe I need to adjust the equation or consider the intersection. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.Wait, the display is a circular base with diameter 10 cm, so radius 5 cm. So, the display is a circle in the plane ( z = 25 ). But the ceramic piece is a paraboloid, so the intersection of the paraboloid with the plane ( z = 25 ) is the point ( (3, 2, 25) ). Wait, no, that's just the maximum point. Actually, the paraboloid is defined such that ( z ) is maximum at ( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ). So, the paraboloid is not symmetric around the origin, which complicates things.Wait, hold on. The equation is ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ). If ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, then as ( x ) and ( y ) increase, ( z ) increases. But in this case, the maximum height is at ( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ). That suggests that the paraboloid is opening upwards, but with a vertex at ( (0, 0, 0) ). Wait, no, actually, the maximum height is at ( (3, 2, 25) ), which would mean that the paraboloid is actually opening downward? Because otherwise, as ( x ) and ( y ) increase, ( z ) would increase without bound.Wait, hold on, maybe I misunderstood the equation. If ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ), and ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, then ( z ) increases as ( x ) and ( y ) move away from the origin. So, the vertex is at the origin, and it opens upwards. So, the maximum height would be at some point away from the origin. But in this case, the maximum height is given at ( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ). So, that must mean that the paraboloid is actually a downward opening one, but that would require ( a ) and ( b ) to be negative. But in part 1, we found ( a ) and ( b ) positive. Hmm, that seems contradictory.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in part 1. Let me think again. If ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ), and ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, then as ( x ) and ( y ) increase, ( z ) increases. So, the maximum height would be at the farthest point from the origin, but in our case, the maximum is at ( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ). So, that suggests that perhaps the paraboloid is not symmetric around the origin, but shifted. Wait, but the equation is ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ), which is symmetric around the origin. So, unless the origin is not the vertex.Wait, maybe the vertex is at ( (3, 2, 25) ). So, the equation should be ( z = a(x - 3)^2 + b(y - 2)^2 + 25 ). But in the problem statement, it's given as ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ). So, that suggests that the vertex is at the origin. So, perhaps the maximum height is at ( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ), which is the farthest point from the origin? But then, if ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, as ( x ) and ( y ) increase, ( z ) increases. So, the maximum height would be at the point where ( x ) and ( y ) are maximum. But in this case, the maximum is given at ( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ). So, perhaps the piece is only defined for ( x ) up to 3 and ( y ) up to 2? Or maybe it's a finite piece.Wait, maybe I need to consider that the paraboloid is only defined up to ( x = 3 ) and ( y = 2 ), beyond which it's not part of the ceramic piece. So, the maximum height is at ( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ), which is 25 cm. So, the equation is ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ), with ( a = 2b ), and when ( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ), ( z = 25 ). So, as I did before, substituting, I get ( a = 25/11 ) and ( b = 25/22 ). So, that's correct.But then, for part 2, the digital display is at the top, which is at ( z = 25 ). So, the display is a circle with diameter 10 cm, so radius 5 cm. So, the display is a circle in the plane ( z = 25 ), centered at ( (3, 2, 25) ), with radius 5 cm. So, I need to find all points ( (x, y) ) such that the distance from ( (x, y) ) to ( (3, 2) ) is less than or equal to 5 cm, and also ( z = 25 ).But wait, the paraboloid equation is ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ). So, at ( z = 25 ), the equation becomes ( 25 = ax^2 + by^2 ). But we also have the display as a circle centered at ( (3, 2) ) with radius 5. So, the intersection of the paraboloid with the plane ( z = 25 ) is just the single point ( (3, 2, 25) ), because that's where the maximum occurs. So, how can the display be a circle? It seems like the display is separate from the paraboloid.Wait, maybe the display is placed on top of the paraboloid, but not necessarily following the paraboloid's shape. So, the display is a flat circular base with diameter 10 cm, placed at the top point ( (3, 2, 25) ). So, the display is a circle in the plane ( z = 25 ), centered at ( (3, 2, 25) ), with radius 5 cm. So, the range of ( x ) and ( y ) for the display would be all points ( (x, y) ) such that ( (x - 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 leq 25 ). But the question says \\"calculate the range of possible values for ( x ) and ( y ) that satisfy the equation of the paraboloid at this height.\\" So, at ( z = 25 ), the paraboloid equation is ( 25 = ax^2 + by^2 ). But we already know that ( a = 25/11 ) and ( b = 25/22 ). So, substituting those in:[ 25 = frac{25}{11}x^2 + frac{25}{22}y^2 ]Divide both sides by 25:[ 1 = frac{1}{11}x^2 + frac{1}{22}y^2 ]Multiply both sides by 22 to eliminate denominators:[ 22 = 2x^2 + y^2 ]So, the equation at ( z = 25 ) is ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ). This is an ellipse in the ( xy )-plane. But the display is a circle with radius 5 cm. So, the intersection of the display with the paraboloid is only at the point ( (3, 2, 25) ), because the ellipse ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ) is much smaller than the circle ( (x - 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 25 ). Wait, so maybe the question is asking for the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at height ( z = 25 ), which is just the single point ( (3, 2) ). But that doesn't make sense because the display is a circle. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.Alternatively, perhaps the display is placed such that its circular base lies on the paraboloid. So, the display is a circle that is part of the paraboloid. But since the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ) is just a single point, that can't be. So, maybe the display is placed at a slightly lower height, but the problem says it's at the top, which is 25 cm.Wait, maybe the display is not part of the paraboloid but is attached to it. So, the display is a separate circular base with diameter 10 cm, placed at the top point ( (3, 2, 25) ). So, the display's base is a circle in the plane ( z = 25 ), centered at ( (3, 2, 25) ), with radius 5 cm. Therefore, the range of ( x ) and ( y ) for the display is all points ( (x, y) ) such that ( (x - 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 leq 25 ). But the question says \\"calculate the range of possible values for ( x ) and ( y ) that satisfy the equation of the paraboloid at this height.\\" So, at ( z = 25 ), the paraboloid equation is ( 25 = ax^2 + by^2 ), which we found to be ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ). So, the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ) is just the single point ( (3, 2) ). But that contradicts the display being a circle.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in part 1. Let me check again. Given ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ), with ( a = 2b ), and at ( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ), ( z = 25 ). So:[ 25 = a(9) + b(4) ][ 25 = 9a + 4b ]But ( a = 2b ), so:[ 25 = 9(2b) + 4b ][ 25 = 18b + 4b ][ 25 = 22b ][ b = 25/22 ][ a = 50/22 = 25/11 ]That seems correct. So, at ( z = 25 ), the equation is ( 25 = (25/11)x^2 + (25/22)y^2 ). Dividing both sides by 25:[ 1 = (1/11)x^2 + (1/22)y^2 ]Multiply by 22:[ 22 = 2x^2 + y^2 ]So, the equation is ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ). This is an ellipse centered at the origin, with semi-major axis along the y-axis. The ellipse has vertices at ( x = sqrt{11} ) and ( y = sqrt{22} ). So, approximately, ( x ) ranges from -3.316 to 3.316, and ( y ) ranges from -4.690 to 4.690. But the display is a circle with radius 5 cm, centered at ( (3, 2) ). So, the display is a circle in the plane ( z = 25 ), but the paraboloid only intersects that plane at the single point ( (3, 2, 25) ). Therefore, the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ) is just ( x = 3 ), ( y = 2 ). But the question says \\"calculate the range of possible values for ( x ) and ( y ) that satisfy the equation of the paraboloid at this height.\\" So, maybe it's asking for the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at the height where the display is placed, which is ( z = 25 ). But as we saw, at ( z = 25 ), the paraboloid only has the point ( (3, 2) ). So, the range is just that single point.But that seems odd because the display is a circle. Maybe the display is placed on the paraboloid, but not at the very top. Maybe it's placed at a slightly lower height, so that the intersection is a circle. But the problem says it's at the top, which is 25 cm. Alternatively, perhaps the paraboloid is such that at ( z = 25 ), it's a circle. But from the equation ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ), it's an ellipse, not a circle. So, unless we adjust the equation, it won't be a circle. Wait, maybe I need to consider that the display is a circle, so the intersection of the paraboloid with the plane ( z = 25 ) must be a circle. But since the paraboloid is given by ( z = ax^2 + by^2 ), the intersection with ( z = 25 ) is ( ax^2 + by^2 = 25 ). For this to be a circle, ( a ) must equal ( b ). But in our case, ( a = 2b ), so it's an ellipse, not a circle. Therefore, the intersection is an ellipse, not a circle. So, perhaps the display is placed such that it's a circle, but it's not part of the paraboloid. So, the display is a separate circle with diameter 10 cm, placed at the top of the paraboloid, which is at ( (3, 2, 25) ). Therefore, the range of ( x ) and ( y ) for the display is all points ( (x, y) ) such that ( (x - 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 leq 25 ). But the question specifically says \\"that satisfy the equation of the paraboloid at this height.\\" So, it's asking for the ( x ) and ( y ) values on the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ). As we saw, that's just the single point ( (3, 2) ). So, maybe the range is just ( x = 3 ) and ( y = 2 ). But that seems too restrictive. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. \\"You are planning to include a digital display at the top of the ceramic piece, which has a circular base. If the diameter of the circular base must be 10 cm, calculate the range of possible values for ( x ) and ( y ) that satisfy the equation of the paraboloid at this height.\\"So, the display has a circular base, which is 10 cm in diameter. The display is at the top, which is 25 cm. So, the base of the display is a circle in the plane ( z = 25 ), with radius 5 cm. But the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ) is just a single point. Therefore, the display is placed at the top, but it's a separate structure, not part of the paraboloid. So, the range of ( x ) and ( y ) for the display is the circle centered at ( (3, 2) ) with radius 5 cm. But the question is asking for the range of ( x ) and ( y ) that satisfy the paraboloid equation at this height. So, at ( z = 25 ), the paraboloid equation is ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ). So, the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ) is the ellipse defined by ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ). But the display is a circle, so maybe the question is asking for the intersection of the display's base with the paraboloid. But since the paraboloid only has the point ( (3, 2, 25) ) at ( z = 25 ), the intersection is just that single point. Alternatively, maybe the display is placed such that its base lies on the paraboloid, but that would require the paraboloid to have a circular cross-section at some height, which it doesn't because ( a neq b ). Wait, perhaps the display is placed on the paraboloid, but it's a flat circular base. So, the base is a circle, but it's not part of the paraboloid. So, the range of ( x ) and ( y ) for the display is the circle ( (x - 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 leq 25 ). But the question is specifically about the paraboloid. So, maybe it's asking for the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ), which is the ellipse ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ). So, the range of ( x ) is from ( -sqrt{11} ) to ( sqrt{11} ), and the range of ( y ) is from ( -sqrt{22} ) to ( sqrt{22} ). But the display is a circle with radius 5, so the range of ( x ) and ( y ) for the display is from ( 3 - 5 ) to ( 3 + 5 ) for ( x ), and ( 2 - 5 ) to ( 2 + 5 ) for ( y ). So, ( x ) ranges from -2 to 8, and ( y ) ranges from -3 to 7. But the question is about the paraboloid at this height, not the display. So, I think the answer is the ellipse ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ), which gives the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ). But the problem says \\"calculate the range of possible values for ( x ) and ( y ) that satisfy the equation of the paraboloid at this height.\\" So, it's asking for the ( x ) and ( y ) values that satisfy ( z = 25 ) in the paraboloid equation. As we found, that's the ellipse ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ). So, the range of ( x ) is ( -sqrt{11} leq x leq sqrt{11} ), and the range of ( y ) is ( -sqrt{22} leq y leq sqrt{22} ). But wait, the display is a circle with diameter 10 cm, so radius 5 cm. So, the display is a circle in the plane ( z = 25 ), centered at ( (3, 2) ). So, the display's ( x ) ranges from ( 3 - 5 = -2 ) to ( 3 + 5 = 8 ), and ( y ) ranges from ( 2 - 5 = -3 ) to ( 2 + 5 = 7 ). But the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ) is the ellipse ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ). So, the intersection of the display and the paraboloid is only at the point ( (3, 2) ), because the ellipse is much smaller. So, maybe the question is asking for the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ), which is the ellipse, but also considering the display's circle. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the display is placed such that its base is part of the paraboloid, meaning that the paraboloid must have a circular cross-section at ( z = 25 ). But since ( a neq b ), the cross-section is an ellipse, not a circle. Therefore, to have a circular base, we need ( a = b ). But in our case, ( a = 2b ), so it's an ellipse. Therefore, the display cannot be a perfect circle if it's part of the paraboloid. So, maybe the display is a separate structure, not part of the paraboloid, placed at the top. Therefore, the range of ( x ) and ( y ) for the display is the circle ( (x - 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 leq 25 ). But the question is about the paraboloid. So, I think the answer is the ellipse ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ), which gives the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ). So, summarizing:1. ( a = frac{25}{11} ) and ( b = frac{25}{22} ).2. The range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ) is the ellipse ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ), so ( x ) ranges from ( -sqrt{11} ) to ( sqrt{11} ) and ( y ) ranges from ( -sqrt{22} ) to ( sqrt{22} ). But wait, the problem says \\"calculate the range of possible values for ( x ) and ( y ) that satisfy the equation of the paraboloid at this height.\\" So, it's asking for the ( x ) and ( y ) values that satisfy ( z = 25 ) in the paraboloid equation, which is the ellipse. So, the range is all ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ). But the display is a circle with diameter 10 cm, so radius 5 cm. So, the display is a circle in the plane ( z = 25 ), centered at ( (3, 2) ). So, the display's ( x ) and ( y ) range from ( 3 - 5 ) to ( 3 + 5 ) and ( 2 - 5 ) to ( 2 + 5 ), respectively. But the question is about the paraboloid, not the display. So, the answer is the ellipse ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ), which gives the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ). Therefore, the range of ( x ) is ( -sqrt{11} leq x leq sqrt{11} ) and the range of ( y ) is ( -sqrt{22} leq y leq sqrt{22} ). But let me check the values. ( sqrt{11} ) is approximately 3.316, and ( sqrt{22} ) is approximately 4.690. So, the ranges are:( x in [-3.316, 3.316] ) cm( y in [-4.690, 4.690] ) cmBut the display is a circle with radius 5 cm, so its ( x ) ranges from -2 to 8 and ( y ) from -3 to 7. Wait, but the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ) is only the ellipse, so the display is a separate structure. Therefore, the range of ( x ) and ( y ) for the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ) is the ellipse, and the display is another structure. So, I think the answer is that the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at ( z = 25 ) is the ellipse ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ), so ( x ) is between ( -sqrt{11} ) and ( sqrt{11} ), and ( y ) is between ( -sqrt{22} ) and ( sqrt{22} ). But the problem mentions the display's circular base, so maybe it's asking for the intersection of the display's base with the paraboloid. But since the paraboloid only has the point ( (3, 2, 25) ) at ( z = 25 ), the intersection is just that single point. Alternatively, maybe the display is placed such that its base is on the paraboloid, but that would require the paraboloid to have a circular cross-section at some height, which it doesn't. I think I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking for the range of ( x ) and ( y ) on the paraboloid at the height where the display is placed, which is 25 cm. So, the range is the ellipse ( 2x^2 + y^2 = 22 ), giving the ranges for ( x ) and ( y ). Therefore, the final answers are:1. ( a = frac{25}{11} ) cm⁻¹ and ( b = frac{25}{22} ) cm⁻¹.2. The range of ( x ) is ( -sqrt{11} ) cm to ( sqrt{11} ) cm, and the range of ( y ) is ( -sqrt{22} ) cm to ( sqrt{22} ) cm.But let me write them in exact form:( x in [- sqrt{11}, sqrt{11}] ) cm( y in [- sqrt{22}, sqrt{22}] ) cmAlternatively, if they want it in terms of the display's circle, but I think it's about the paraboloid.So, I think that's the answer."},{"question":"A community member, Alex, is helping a local farmer with the harvest and distribution of apples. The farmer's orchard is divided into two sections, A and B. Section A produces apples according to the polynomial function ( f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 ), where ( x ) represents the number of weeks since the beginning of the harvest season. Section B produces apples based on the quadratic function ( g(x) = -x^2 + 6x + 2 ).1. Determine when the production in Section A exceeds the production in Section B by solving the inequality ( f(x) > g(x) ).2. After deciding to distribute the apples, Alex wants to ensure that the combined production from both sections is at least 100 kilograms. Solve the inequality ( f(x) + g(x) geq 100 ) to find the range of weeks when this condition is met.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about Alex helping a farmer with apple production. There are two sections, A and B, each with their own functions. I need to figure out two things: when Section A's production exceeds Section B's, and when the combined production is at least 100 kilograms. Let me break this down step by step.First, let's tackle the first part: determining when production in Section A exceeds that in Section B. That means I need to solve the inequality ( f(x) > g(x) ). Given that ( f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 ) and ( g(x) = -x^2 + 6x + 2 ), I can set up the inequality as:( 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 > -x^2 + 6x + 2 )Hmm, okay, so I should bring all the terms to one side to make it easier to solve. Let me subtract ( g(x) ) from both sides:( 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 - (-x^2 + 6x + 2) > 0 )Simplifying that, I distribute the negative sign:( 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 + x^2 - 6x - 2 > 0 )Now, combine like terms:- The ( x^3 ) term is just ( 2x^3 ).- For ( x^2 ): ( -3x^2 + x^2 = -2x^2 ).- For ( x ): ( 4x - 6x = -2x ).- Constants: ( -5 - 2 = -7 ).So the inequality becomes:( 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 7 > 0 )Alright, now I have a cubic inequality. Solving cubic inequalities can be tricky, but I remember that one method is to find the roots of the corresponding equation ( 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 7 = 0 ) and then test intervals between the roots to see where the expression is positive.Let me try to find the roots. Maybe I can factor this cubic equation or use the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient. So possible roots are ( pm1, pm7, pmfrac{1}{2}, pmfrac{7}{2} ).Let me test ( x = 1 ):( 2(1)^3 - 2(1)^2 - 2(1) - 7 = 2 - 2 - 2 - 7 = -9 ) which is not zero.Testing ( x = 2 ):( 2(8) - 2(4) - 2(2) - 7 = 16 - 8 - 4 - 7 = -3 ) still not zero.Testing ( x = 3 ):( 2(27) - 2(9) - 2(3) - 7 = 54 - 18 - 6 - 7 = 23 ) which is positive.Hmm, so between 2 and 3, the function goes from -3 to 23, so by Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a root between 2 and 3.Testing ( x = 1.5 ):( 2(3.375) - 2(2.25) - 2(1.5) - 7 = 6.75 - 4.5 - 3 - 7 = -7.75 ) which is negative.So between 1.5 and 3, the function crosses from negative to positive. Let me try ( x = 2.5 ):( 2(15.625) - 2(6.25) - 2(2.5) - 7 = 31.25 - 12.5 - 5 - 7 = 6.75 ) which is positive.So between 1.5 and 2.5, the function crosses zero. Let me try ( x = 2 ):Wait, I already did ( x = 2 ), it was -3. So between 2 and 2.5, it goes from -3 to 6.75. Let me try ( x = 2.25 ):( 2(11.390625) - 2(5.0625) - 2(2.25) - 7 )= 22.78125 - 10.125 - 4.5 - 7= 22.78125 - 21.625= 1.15625 which is positive.So between 2 and 2.25, it goes from -3 to positive. Let me try ( x = 2.1 ):( 2(9.261) - 2(4.41) - 2(2.1) - 7 )= 18.522 - 8.82 - 4.2 - 7= 18.522 - 20.02= -1.498 which is still negative.So between 2.1 and 2.25, the function crosses zero. Let me try ( x = 2.15 ):( 2(2.15)^3 - 2(2.15)^2 - 2(2.15) - 7 )First, calculate ( 2.15^3 ):2.15 * 2.15 = 4.62254.6225 * 2.15 ≈ 9.938125So 2 * 9.938125 ≈ 19.87625Next, ( 2.15^2 = 4.6225 ), so 2 * 4.6225 = 9.245Then, 2 * 2.15 = 4.3So putting it all together:19.87625 - 9.245 - 4.3 - 7 ≈ 19.87625 - 20.545 ≈ -0.66875Still negative. Let's try ( x = 2.18 ):Calculate ( 2.18^3 ):2.18 * 2.18 = 4.75244.7524 * 2.18 ≈ 10.3322 * 10.332 ≈ 20.664( 2.18^2 = 4.7524 ), so 2 * 4.7524 ≈ 9.50482 * 2.18 = 4.36Putting it all together:20.664 - 9.5048 - 4.36 - 7 ≈ 20.664 - 20.8648 ≈ -0.2008Still negative, but getting closer. Let's try ( x = 2.19 ):( 2.19^3 ):2.19 * 2.19 = 4.79614.7961 * 2.19 ≈ 10.4852 * 10.485 ≈ 20.97( 2.19^2 = 4.7961 ), so 2 * 4.7961 ≈ 9.59222 * 2.19 = 4.38Putting it all together:20.97 - 9.5922 - 4.38 - 7 ≈ 20.97 - 20.9722 ≈ -0.0022Almost zero, but still slightly negative. Let's try ( x = 2.191 ):( 2.191^3 ):First, 2.191 * 2.191 ≈ 4.800481Then, 4.800481 * 2.191 ≈ 10.5122 * 10.512 ≈ 21.024( 2.191^2 ≈ 4.800481 ), so 2 * 4.800481 ≈ 9.6009622 * 2.191 ≈ 4.382Putting it all together:21.024 - 9.600962 - 4.382 - 7 ≈ 21.024 - 20.982962 ≈ 0.041038Positive now. So the root is between 2.19 and 2.191. For practical purposes, let's approximate it as 2.19.So, the equation ( 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 7 = 0 ) has a real root at approximately x ≈ 2.19. Since it's a cubic, there might be other roots, but let's check.Looking at the behavior of the cubic function as x approaches positive and negative infinity. As x approaches positive infinity, ( 2x^3 ) dominates, so the function goes to positive infinity. As x approaches negative infinity, ( 2x^3 ) dominates and goes to negative infinity. Since we found one real root around 2.19, there might be other real roots.Let me test for negative x. Let's try x = -1:( 2(-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 - 2(-1) - 7 = -2 - 2 + 2 - 7 = -9 )x = -2:( 2(-8) - 2(4) - 2(-2) - 7 = -16 - 8 + 4 - 7 = -27 )So it's negative at x = -1 and x = -2. Let me check x = 0:( 0 - 0 - 0 - 7 = -7 )Still negative. So maybe only one real root? Let me check the derivative to see if there are multiple turning points.The derivative of ( 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 7 ) is ( 6x^2 - 4x - 2 ). Setting this equal to zero:( 6x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0 )Using quadratic formula:( x = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 48)] / 12 = [4 ± sqrt(64)] / 12 = [4 ± 8] / 12 )So x = (12)/12 = 1 or x = (-4)/12 = -1/3.So the function has critical points at x = 1 and x = -1/3. Let's evaluate the function at these points to see if there are any other roots.At x = 1:( 2(1)^3 - 2(1)^2 - 2(1) - 7 = 2 - 2 - 2 - 7 = -9 )At x = -1/3:( 2(-1/3)^3 - 2(-1/3)^2 - 2(-1/3) - 7 )= 2(-1/27) - 2(1/9) + 2/3 - 7= -2/27 - 2/9 + 2/3 - 7Convert to common denominator 27:= -2/27 - 6/27 + 18/27 - 189/27= (-2 - 6 + 18 - 189)/27= (-179)/27 ≈ -6.63So both critical points are below zero. That suggests that the function only crosses the x-axis once, around x ≈ 2.19. Therefore, the inequality ( 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x - 7 > 0 ) is satisfied for x > approximately 2.19.But since x represents weeks since the beginning of the harvest season, it must be a positive integer. So, the production in Section A exceeds Section B starting from week 3 onwards.Wait, but let me verify. Since the root is at approximately 2.19 weeks, which is between week 2 and week 3. So, for x > 2.19, which would be week 3 and beyond, the inequality holds.Therefore, the answer to part 1 is x > approximately 2.19 weeks, so in practical terms, starting from week 3.Now, moving on to part 2: solving the inequality ( f(x) + g(x) geq 100 ). Let's compute ( f(x) + g(x) ):( f(x) + g(x) = (2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5) + (-x^2 + 6x + 2) )Combine like terms:- ( 2x^3 )- ( -3x^2 - x^2 = -4x^2 )- ( 4x + 6x = 10x )- ( -5 + 2 = -3 )So, ( f(x) + g(x) = 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x - 3 )We need to solve ( 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x - 3 geq 100 )Subtract 100 from both sides:( 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x - 103 geq 0 )So, we need to solve ( 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x - 103 geq 0 )Again, this is a cubic inequality. Let's find the roots of the equation ( 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x - 103 = 0 ).Trying possible rational roots: factors of 103 over factors of 2. 103 is a prime number, so possible roots are ( pm1, pm103, pmfrac{1}{2}, pmfrac{103}{2} ).Testing x = 1:( 2 - 4 + 10 - 103 = -95 ) not zero.x = 2:( 16 - 16 + 20 - 103 = -83 ) not zero.x = 3:( 54 - 36 + 30 - 103 = -55 ) not zero.x = 4:( 128 - 64 + 40 - 103 = 1 ) which is close to zero.So at x = 4, the function is 1, which is just above zero. Let me check x = 3.9:Calculate ( 2(3.9)^3 - 4(3.9)^2 + 10(3.9) - 103 )First, ( 3.9^3 = 3.9 * 3.9 * 3.9 = 15.21 * 3.9 ≈ 59.319 )So 2 * 59.319 ≈ 118.638Next, ( 3.9^2 = 15.21 ), so 4 * 15.21 = 60.8410 * 3.9 = 39Putting it all together:118.638 - 60.84 + 39 - 103 ≈ 118.638 - 60.84 = 57.798; 57.798 + 39 = 96.798; 96.798 - 103 ≈ -6.202Negative. So between x = 3.9 and x = 4, the function goes from -6.202 to 1. So the root is between 3.9 and 4.Let me try x = 3.95:( 2(3.95)^3 - 4(3.95)^2 + 10(3.95) - 103 )Calculate ( 3.95^3 ):3.95 * 3.95 = 15.602515.6025 * 3.95 ≈ 61.59962 * 61.5996 ≈ 123.1992( 3.95^2 = 15.6025 ), so 4 * 15.6025 ≈ 62.4110 * 3.95 = 39.5Putting it all together:123.1992 - 62.41 + 39.5 - 103 ≈ 123.1992 - 62.41 = 60.7892; 60.7892 + 39.5 = 100.2892; 100.2892 - 103 ≈ -2.7108Still negative. Let's try x = 3.98:( 3.98^3 ≈ 3.98 * 3.98 * 3.98 )First, 3.98 * 3.98 ≈ 15.840415.8404 * 3.98 ≈ 62.95362 * 62.9536 ≈ 125.9072( 3.98^2 ≈ 15.8404 ), so 4 * 15.8404 ≈ 63.361610 * 3.98 = 39.8Putting it all together:125.9072 - 63.3616 + 39.8 - 103 ≈ 125.9072 - 63.3616 = 62.5456; 62.5456 + 39.8 = 102.3456; 102.3456 - 103 ≈ -0.6544Still negative. Let's try x = 3.99:( 3.99^3 ≈ 3.99 * 3.99 * 3.99 )3.99 * 3.99 ≈ 15.920115.9201 * 3.99 ≈ 63.52122 * 63.5212 ≈ 127.0424( 3.99^2 ≈ 15.9201 ), so 4 * 15.9201 ≈ 63.680410 * 3.99 = 39.9Putting it all together:127.0424 - 63.6804 + 39.9 - 103 ≈ 127.0424 - 63.6804 = 63.362; 63.362 + 39.9 = 103.262; 103.262 - 103 ≈ 0.262Positive now. So the root is between 3.98 and 3.99. Let's approximate it as x ≈ 3.985.So the equation ( 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x - 103 = 0 ) has a real root around x ≈ 3.985. Since it's a cubic, let's check for other roots.Testing x = 5:( 2(125) - 4(25) + 10(5) - 103 = 250 - 100 + 50 - 103 = 97 ) which is positive.Testing x = 0:( 0 - 0 + 0 - 103 = -103 ) negative.So the function goes from negative at x=0 to positive at x=4, crossing zero once around x≈3.985. Let's check the derivative to see if there are multiple turning points.Derivative of ( 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x - 103 ) is ( 6x^2 - 8x + 10 ). Setting this equal to zero:( 6x^2 - 8x + 10 = 0 )Discriminant: ( 64 - 240 = -176 ) which is negative, so no real roots. That means the function is always increasing or always decreasing? Wait, the derivative is a quadratic with a positive leading coefficient and no real roots, so it's always positive. Therefore, the function is strictly increasing.So, since it's strictly increasing, there's only one real root at x ≈ 3.985. Therefore, the inequality ( 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x - 103 geq 0 ) is satisfied for x ≥ approximately 3.985.Since x represents weeks, and it's a continuous variable, but in reality, weeks are integers. So, starting from week 4, the combined production is at least 100 kilograms.Wait, let me verify at x = 4:( f(4) + g(4) = (2*64 - 3*16 + 4*4 -5) + (-16 + 24 + 2) )= (128 - 48 + 16 -5) + (10)= (91) + (10) = 101 kg, which is above 100.At x = 3:( f(3) + g(3) = (54 - 27 + 12 -5) + (-9 + 18 + 2) )= (34) + (11) = 45 kg, which is below 100.So, starting from week 4, the combined production meets or exceeds 100 kg.Therefore, the answer to part 2 is x ≥ 4 weeks.Wait, but the root was at approximately 3.985, so technically, at x ≈ 3.985 weeks, the production reaches 100 kg. So, in terms of weeks, since we can't have a fraction of a week in practical terms, we'd say starting from week 4.But if we consider x as a continuous variable, the inequality holds for x ≥ approximately 3.985. But since the question is about weeks, which are discrete, we round up to the next whole week, which is week 4.So, summarizing:1. Section A's production exceeds Section B's starting from week 3 onwards.2. The combined production is at least 100 kg starting from week 4.I think that's it. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.For part 1, the cubic equation was correctly simplified, and the root was found around 2.19, so x > 2.19, which is week 3.For part 2, the combined function was correctly summed, and the root was around 3.985, so x ≥ 4 weeks.Yes, that seems correct."},{"question":"A computer science student, inspired by the unwavering work ethic and determination of a linebacker, decides to tackle an ambitious coding project.

Use the vertex form of a quadratic equation to determine the horizontal distance at which the football reaches its maximum height.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a football pass trajectory modeled by a quadratic equation. The equation given is ( y = -2x^2 + 8x + 10 ), where ( y ) is the height in feet and ( x ) is the horizontal distance in yards from the quarterback. There are two parts to this problem. First, I need to find the horizontal distance(s) where the football is at a height of exactly 12 feet. That means I have to solve for ( x ) when ( y = 12 ). Okay, so let me write that equation down:( 12 = -2x^2 + 8x + 10 )Hmm, this is a quadratic equation, so I can rearrange it to standard form and then solve for ( x ). Let me subtract 12 from both sides to set it equal to zero:( -2x^2 + 8x + 10 - 12 = 0 )Simplifying that:( -2x^2 + 8x - 2 = 0 )Hmm, I can factor out a common factor first. All the coefficients are even, so let me factor out a -2 to make it simpler:( -2(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 0 )Wait, actually, if I factor out a -2, the signs inside the parentheses will change. Let me double-check:( -2x^2 + 8x - 2 = -2(x^2 - 4x + 1) )Yes, that's correct. So, now I have:( -2(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 0 )Since -2 isn't zero, I can divide both sides by -2 to get:( x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 )Now, this is a quadratic equation in the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), where ( a = 1 ), ( b = -4 ), and ( c = 1 ). I can use the quadratic formula to solve for ( x ):( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Plugging in the values:( x = frac{-(-4) pm sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} )Simplify step by step:First, the numerator:( -(-4) = 4 )Under the square root:( (-4)^2 = 16 )( 4ac = 4*1*1 = 4 )So, the discriminant is:( 16 - 4 = 12 )So, plugging back in:( x = frac{4 pm sqrt{12}}{2} )Simplify ( sqrt{12} ). Since 12 is 4*3, ( sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3} ). So:( x = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{3}}{2} )I can factor out a 2 in the numerator:( x = frac{2(2 pm sqrt{3})}{2} )Cancel out the 2:( x = 2 pm sqrt{3} )So, the solutions are:( x = 2 + sqrt{3} ) and ( x = 2 - sqrt{3} )Since ( x ) represents horizontal distance in yards, it can't be negative. Let me check the values:( sqrt{3} ) is approximately 1.732, so:( 2 + 1.732 = 3.732 ) yards( 2 - 1.732 = 0.268 ) yardsBoth are positive, so both solutions are valid. Therefore, the football is at 12 feet at approximately 0.268 yards and 3.732 yards from the quarterback.Wait, but let me think about this. The football is thrown from the quarterback, so the initial point is at x=0. The equation is ( y = -2x^2 + 8x + 10 ). So, when x=0, y=10, which is the initial height. Then, as x increases, the football goes up, reaches a peak, and comes back down.So, the two points where y=12 are on either side of the peak. That makes sense because the parabola opens downward (since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is negative), so it will cross y=12 twice: once going up and once coming down.So, the two distances are approximately 0.268 yards and 3.732 yards. But the question asks for the horizontal distance(s), so I should present both solutions.Now, moving on to the second part. The student wants to calculate when the football will reach the peak of its trajectory. They suggest using the vertex form of a quadratic equation.I remember that the vertex form of a quadratic is ( y = a(x - h)^2 + k ), where (h, k) is the vertex. Since the parabola opens downward, the vertex will be the maximum point, which is the peak.Alternatively, I can use the formula for the vertex. For a quadratic in standard form ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ), the x-coordinate of the vertex is at ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ).Given the equation ( y = -2x^2 + 8x + 10 ), so ( a = -2 ), ( b = 8 ).So, plugging into the formula:( x = -frac{8}{2*(-2)} = -frac{8}{-4} = 2 )So, the horizontal distance at which the football reaches its maximum height is 2 yards.Let me verify this by converting the equation to vertex form.Starting with ( y = -2x^2 + 8x + 10 )Factor out the coefficient of ( x^2 ) from the first two terms:( y = -2(x^2 - 4x) + 10 )Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses. The coefficient of x is -4, so half of that is -2, and squaring it gives 4.So, add and subtract 4 inside the parentheses:( y = -2[(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4)] + 10 )Wait, actually, since I factored out a -2, I need to be careful with the signs.Let me write it step by step.Original equation:( y = -2x^2 + 8x + 10 )Factor out -2 from the first two terms:( y = -2(x^2 - 4x) + 10 )Now, inside the parentheses: ( x^2 - 4x ). To complete the square, take half of -4, which is -2, square it to get 4.So, add and subtract 4 inside the parentheses:( y = -2[(x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4] + 10 )Simplify:( y = -2[(x - 2)^2 - 4] + 10 )Distribute the -2:( y = -2(x - 2)^2 + 8 + 10 )Combine constants:( y = -2(x - 2)^2 + 18 )So, the vertex form is ( y = -2(x - 2)^2 + 18 ), which confirms that the vertex is at (2, 18). So, the maximum height is 18 feet at x=2 yards.Therefore, the football reaches its peak at 2 yards from the quarterback.Wait, just to make sure, let me plug x=2 back into the original equation:( y = -2(2)^2 + 8(2) + 10 = -8 + 16 + 10 = 18 ). Yep, that's correct.So, summarizing:1. The football is at 12 feet at approximately 0.268 yards and 3.732 yards from the quarterback.2. The peak of the trajectory is at 2 yards from the quarterback.I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, but let me just double-check the quadratic solution.Original equation: ( -2x^2 + 8x + 10 = 12 )Subtract 12: ( -2x^2 + 8x - 2 = 0 )Divide by -2: ( x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 )Quadratic formula: ( x = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 4)] / 2 = [4 ± sqrt(12)] / 2 = 2 ± sqrt(3) ). Yep, that's correct.So, the two x-values are indeed 2 + sqrt(3) and 2 - sqrt(3), which are approximately 3.732 and 0.268 yards.All right, I think I've got it.**Final Answer**1. The football is at 12 feet at horizontal distances of boxed{2 + sqrt{3}} yards and boxed{2 - sqrt{3}} yards from the quarterback.2. The football reaches its maximum height at a horizontal distance of boxed{2} yards from the quarterback."},{"question":"A children's book author is writing a story about a magical garden, where each type of fruit has a special power that helps kids stay healthy.

Additionally, the total number of trees (both apple and orange) is 35.1. Let ( x ) represent the number of orange trees. Write an equation to represent the total number of trees and solve for ( x ), the number of orange trees.2. Once you have found the number of orange trees, determine how many apple trees there are in the magical garden.","answer":"First, I'll define the variables. Let ( x ) represent the number of orange trees. According to the problem, the number of apple trees is 5 more than twice the number of orange trees, so the number of apple trees can be expressed as ( 2x + 5 ).Next, I'll set up the equation for the total number of trees. The total is the sum of orange trees and apple trees, which gives me:[x + (2x + 5) = 35]Simplifying the equation, I combine like terms:[3x + 5 = 35]To solve for ( x ), I'll subtract 5 from both sides:[3x = 30]Then, divide both sides by 3:[x = 10]So, there are 10 orange trees. To find the number of apple trees, I'll substitute ( x = 10 ) back into the expression for apple trees:[2(10) + 5 = 25]Therefore, there are 25 apple trees in the magical garden."},{"question":"A mathematician collaborating with a physicist is working on a mathematical model involving the interference of two wave functions.

( y_2(t) = t^2 - 4t + 5 )To understand the points of constructive interference, where the amplitudes of both waves are equal, the mathematician must find the values of ( t ) such that ( y_1(t) = y_2(t) ).a) Solve the equation ( -2t^2 + 8t - 3 = t^2 - 4t + 5 ) to find the points in time ( t ) where the wave amplitudes are equal.b) Once the values of ( t ) are determined, verify one of the solutions by substituting it back into both wave functions to ensure that the amplitudes are indeed equal at that time.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the times ( t ) when two wave functions have equal amplitudes. The wave functions are given by quadratic equations:1. ( y_1(t) = -2t^2 + 8t - 3 )2. ( y_2(t) = t^2 - 4t + 5 )The question is asking me to solve the equation ( y_1(t) = y_2(t) ) to find the points of constructive interference. Then, I need to verify one of the solutions by plugging it back into both equations.Alright, let me start by setting the two equations equal to each other. That means:( -2t^2 + 8t - 3 = t^2 - 4t + 5 )Hmm, okay. So, to solve for ( t ), I should bring all the terms to one side so that I can have a standard quadratic equation. Let me subtract ( t^2 - 4t + 5 ) from both sides to get everything on the left.So, subtracting ( t^2 ) from the left side gives me ( -2t^2 - t^2 ), which is ( -3t^2 ). Then, subtracting ( -4t ) is like adding ( 4t ), so ( 8t + 4t = 12t ). Finally, subtracting 5 from -3 gives me ( -3 - 5 = -8 ).Putting it all together, the equation becomes:( -3t^2 + 12t - 8 = 0 )Hmm, that looks manageable. Now, I have a quadratic equation in the form ( at^2 + bt + c = 0 ), where ( a = -3 ), ( b = 12 ), and ( c = -8 ).I can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is:( t = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Plugging in the values:( t = frac{-12 pm sqrt{(12)^2 - 4*(-3)*(-8)}}{2*(-3)} )Let me compute the discriminant first, which is ( b^2 - 4ac ):( 12^2 = 144 )( 4ac = 4*(-3)*(-8) = 4*24 = 96 )So, the discriminant is ( 144 - 96 = 48 ). Wait, that's positive, so there are two real solutions. Good, that makes sense because two quadratics can intersect at two points.Now, plugging back into the formula:( t = frac{-12 pm sqrt{48}}{-6} )Simplify ( sqrt{48} ). Since 48 is 16*3, ( sqrt{48} = 4sqrt{3} ). So, we have:( t = frac{-12 pm 4sqrt{3}}{-6} )Hmm, let's simplify this. I can factor out a -6 from the denominator, but let me see:First, let me split the numerator:( t = frac{-12}{-6} pm frac{4sqrt{3}}{-6} )Simplify each term:( frac{-12}{-6} = 2 )( frac{4sqrt{3}}{-6} = -frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )So, putting it together:( t = 2 pm left(-frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}right) )Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.Alternatively, I can factor out a common factor in the numerator and denominator. Let's see:( t = frac{-12 pm 4sqrt{3}}{-6} )I can factor out a -4 from the numerator:( t = frac{-4(3 mp sqrt{3})}{-6} )Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, factor out a 2 from numerator and denominator:Numerator: -12 ± 4√3 = -4(3 ∓ √3)Denominator: -6 = -6So, ( t = frac{-4(3 ∓ √3)}{-6} )Simplify the negatives:( t = frac{4(3 ∓ √3)}{6} )Which simplifies to:( t = frac{2(3 ∓ √3)}{3} )So, that's ( t = frac{6 ∓ 2sqrt{3}}{3} )Which can be written as:( t = 2 ∓ frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )Alternatively, factor out a 2/3:( t = frac{2}{3}(3 ∓ sqrt{3}) )But perhaps the simplest way is:( t = 2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ) and ( t = 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )Wait, let me check my steps again because I might have made a sign error.Original equation after moving everything to the left:( -3t^2 + 12t - 8 = 0 )Quadratic formula:( t = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Here, ( a = -3 ), ( b = 12 ), ( c = -8 )So, substituting:( t = frac{-12 pm sqrt{144 - 4*(-3)*(-8)}}{2*(-3)} )Compute discriminant:144 - 4*3*8 = 144 - 96 = 48So, sqrt(48) = 4√3Thus,( t = frac{-12 pm 4sqrt{3}}{-6} )Now, let's divide numerator and denominator by -6:( t = frac{-12}{-6} pm frac{4sqrt{3}}{-6} )Which is:( t = 2 mp frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )Ah, so the two solutions are:( t = 2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ) and ( t = 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )Wait, that makes sense because when you divide both terms by -6, the first term becomes positive, and the second term flips the sign.So, yes, the solutions are ( t = 2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ) and ( t = 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).Alternatively, we can write these as:( t = frac{6 - 2sqrt{3}}{3} ) and ( t = frac{6 + 2sqrt{3}}{3} ), which simplifies to ( t = 2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ) and ( t = 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).I think that's correct. Let me just verify the calculations once more.Starting from:( -2t^2 + 8t - 3 = t^2 - 4t + 5 )Bring all terms to left:( -2t^2 - t^2 + 8t + 4t - 3 - 5 = 0 )Which is:( -3t^2 + 12t - 8 = 0 )Yes, that's correct.Quadratic formula:( t = frac{-12 pm sqrt{144 - 96}}{-6} )Which is:( t = frac{-12 pm sqrt{48}}{-6} )Simplify sqrt(48) as 4√3:( t = frac{-12 pm 4sqrt{3}}{-6} )Divide numerator and denominator by -6:( t = frac{12 mp 4sqrt{3}}{6} )Simplify:( t = 2 mp frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )Yes, that's consistent.So, the two times when the amplitudes are equal are ( t = 2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ) and ( t = 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).Now, for part b), I need to verify one of these solutions by plugging it back into both wave functions.Let me choose ( t = 2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ) because it might be simpler.First, compute ( y_1(t) = -2t^2 + 8t - 3 )Let me compute ( t^2 ):( t = 2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )So, ( t^2 = left(2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}right)^2 )Expanding this:( (2)^2 + left(frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}right)^2 - 2*2*frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} )Which is:( 4 + frac{4*3}{9} - frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} )Simplify:( 4 + frac{12}{9} - frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} )( 4 + frac{4}{3} - frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} )Convert 4 to thirds: ( 4 = frac{12}{3} )So, ( frac{12}{3} + frac{4}{3} = frac{16}{3} )Thus, ( t^2 = frac{16}{3} - frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} )Now, compute ( y_1(t) = -2t^2 + 8t - 3 )Plug in ( t^2 ):( -2*left(frac{16}{3} - frac{8sqrt{3}}{3}right) + 8*left(2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}right) - 3 )Compute each term:First term: ( -2*frac{16}{3} = -frac{32}{3} )Second term: ( -2*(-frac{8sqrt{3}}{3}) = +frac{16sqrt{3}}{3} )Third term: ( 8*2 = 16 )Fourth term: ( 8*(-frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) = -frac{16sqrt{3}}{3} )Fifth term: -3So, putting it all together:( -frac{32}{3} + frac{16sqrt{3}}{3} + 16 - frac{16sqrt{3}}{3} - 3 )Simplify term by term:The ( frac{16sqrt{3}}{3} ) and ( -frac{16sqrt{3}}{3} ) cancel each other out.Now, the constants:( -frac{32}{3} + 16 - 3 )Convert 16 and 3 to thirds:16 = ( frac{48}{3} )3 = ( frac{9}{3} )So:( -frac{32}{3} + frac{48}{3} - frac{9}{3} = frac{-32 + 48 - 9}{3} = frac{7}{3} )So, ( y_1(t) = frac{7}{3} )Now, compute ( y_2(t) = t^2 - 4t + 5 )We already have ( t^2 = frac{16}{3} - frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} )Compute ( -4t ):( -4*(2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}) = -8 + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} )So, putting it all together:( y_2(t) = left(frac{16}{3} - frac{8sqrt{3}}{3}right) + left(-8 + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3}right) + 5 )Simplify term by term:( frac{16}{3} - frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} - 8 + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} + 5 )Again, the ( -frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} ) and ( +frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} ) cancel each other.Now, the constants:( frac{16}{3} - 8 + 5 )Convert 8 and 5 to thirds:8 = ( frac{24}{3} )5 = ( frac{15}{3} )So:( frac{16}{3} - frac{24}{3} + frac{15}{3} = frac{16 - 24 + 15}{3} = frac{7}{3} )So, ( y_2(t) = frac{7}{3} ) as well.Therefore, both ( y_1(t) ) and ( y_2(t) ) equal ( frac{7}{3} ) at ( t = 2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ), which confirms that this is indeed a point of constructive interference.I think that's thorough enough. I could also verify the other solution ( t = 2 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ) in the same way, but since the process is similar and the algebra worked out correctly for one solution, I feel confident that the other solution is also valid.**Final Answer**a) The times when the wave amplitudes are equal are ( boxed{2 - dfrac{2sqrt{3}}{3}} ) and ( boxed{2 + dfrac{2sqrt{3}}{3}} ).b) Verification for ( t = 2 - dfrac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ) shows that both ( y_1(t) ) and ( y_2(t) ) equal ( dfrac{7}{3} ), confirming the solution."},{"question":"A retired ballerina has been tracking the career of Kapustina, a famous ballerina, who has performed in various cities over the years.

Calculate the total resistance ( T ) when the resistance ( R ) is at the value found in sub-problem 1.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where an electrical engineer and a PhD candidate are working on optimizing electrical circuits. They've come up with a quadratic model to minimize power loss, and there's also a part about combining resistors in parallel. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, problem 1 is about finding the value of R that minimizes the power loss given by the equation P(R) = 2R² - 12R + 18. Hmm, quadratic equations. I remember that quadratics have a parabola shape when graphed, and since the coefficient of R² is positive (which is 2 here), the parabola opens upwards. That means the vertex of the parabola is the minimum point. So, the R value at the vertex will give me the minimum power loss.How do I find the vertex of a quadratic equation? The standard form of a quadratic is ax² + bx + c, and the vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a). Let me apply that here. In this case, a is 2 and b is -12. So plugging into the formula, R = -(-12)/(2*2) = 12/4 = 3. So R is 3 ohms. That should be the resistance that minimizes power loss.Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can use calculus instead? If I take the derivative of P(R) with respect to R, set it equal to zero, and solve for R, that should give me the critical point, which in this case should be the minimum.So, P(R) = 2R² - 12R + 18. The derivative, P'(R), is 4R - 12. Setting that equal to zero: 4R - 12 = 0. Adding 12 to both sides: 4R = 12. Dividing both sides by 4: R = 3. Yep, same result. So that seems solid.Alright, so the first part is done. The resistance that minimizes power loss is 3 ohms.Moving on to problem 2. The engineer proposes a linear model for total resistance when combining components in parallel. The formula given is 1/T = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃. They've given R₁ = 6 ohms, R₂ = 9 ohms, and R₃ = R. So, since we found R in part 1, which is 3 ohms, we can plug that in to find T.Let me write that out:1/T = 1/6 + 1/9 + 1/3.I need to compute the sum of these reciprocals and then take the reciprocal of that sum to get T.First, let's compute each term:1/6 is approximately 0.1667, 1/9 is approximately 0.1111, and 1/3 is approximately 0.3333. Adding them together: 0.1667 + 0.1111 = 0.2778, plus 0.3333 is about 0.6111.So, 1/T ≈ 0.6111, which means T ≈ 1 / 0.6111 ≈ 1.6364 ohms. But let me do this more accurately without approximating.To add the fractions exactly, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 6, 9, and 3. The least common multiple of 6, 9, and 3 is 18. So, let's convert each fraction:1/6 = 3/18,1/9 = 2/18,1/3 = 6/18.Adding these together: 3/18 + 2/18 + 6/18 = (3 + 2 + 6)/18 = 11/18.So, 1/T = 11/18, which means T = 18/11 ohms. Let me compute that as a decimal: 18 divided by 11 is approximately 1.6364 ohms, which matches my earlier approximation.So, the total resistance T is 18/11 ohms, or approximately 1.6364 ohms.Wait, let me just verify that step again. The reciprocals add up to 11/18, so T is 18/11. Yes, that's correct because if 1/T = 11/18, then T = 18/11. That makes sense.So, summarizing:1. The resistance R that minimizes power loss is 3 ohms.2. When R is 3 ohms, the total resistance T in parallel with 6 ohms and 9 ohms is 18/11 ohms.I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. I used two methods for part 1—vertex formula and calculus—both gave me the same answer, so that's reassuring. For part 2, I converted the fractions to a common denominator and added them exactly, which gives me an exact value for T. So, I think I'm confident with these results.**Final Answer**1. The value of ( R ) that minimizes the power loss is boxed{3} ohms.2. The total resistance ( T ) is boxed{dfrac{18}{11}} ohms."},{"question":"As an independent author delving into the depths of quantum physics and existential queries, you find yourself pondering the mysterious relationship between reality and perception.

The function is given by:[ P(x) = -2x^2 + 4x + 3 ]Sub-problem 1: Determine the critical points where the event's probability reaches a maximum, and interpret what these points signify in terms of the author's exploration of perception and reality.Sub-problem 2: Suppose the author believes that the probability of the event should never fall below a certain existential threshold, say 2. Set up and solve an inequality to find the range of values for ( x ) where the probability ( P(x) geq 2 ), and discuss how this range might influence the author's narrative on the balance between certainty and existential uncertainty.","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the probability function P(x) = -2x² + 4x + 3. It's a quadratic function, which I remember has a parabola shape when graphed. Since the coefficient of x² is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward, meaning it has a maximum point at its vertex. Starting with Sub-problem 1: I need to find the critical points where the probability reaches a maximum. I think critical points in calculus are where the derivative is zero or undefined, but since this is a quadratic, it's a simple function, so maybe I can find the vertex directly. Wait, the vertex of a parabola given by ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). So here, a is -2 and b is 4. Plugging in, x = -4/(2*(-2)) = -4/(-4) = 1. So the x-coordinate of the vertex is 1. To find the maximum probability, I plug x=1 back into P(x): P(1) = -2(1)² + 4(1) + 3 = -2 + 4 + 3 = 5. So the maximum probability is 5 at x=1.Interpreting this in terms of perception and reality: Maybe the author is suggesting that there's a peak point where the quantum event's probability is highest, symbolizing a moment of clarity or maximum perception. It could imply that beyond this point, the probability decreases, representing how our perception might distort reality as we move away from this peak.Moving on to Sub-problem 2: The author wants the probability to never fall below 2. So I need to solve the inequality P(x) ≥ 2. That translates to -2x² + 4x + 3 ≥ 2. Let me subtract 2 from both sides to get -2x² + 4x + 1 ≥ 0.This is a quadratic inequality. To solve it, I can find the roots of the equation -2x² + 4x + 1 = 0 and then determine the intervals where the quadratic is non-negative. Let me use the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a = -2, b = 4, c = 1.Calculating the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 16 - 4*(-2)(1) = 16 + 8 = 24. So the roots are x = [-4 ± sqrt(24)]/(2*(-2)). Simplify sqrt(24) to 2*sqrt(6), so x = [-4 ± 2sqrt(6)]/(-4). Wait, that can be simplified further. Let's factor out a 2 in the numerator: x = [2*(-2 ± sqrt(6))]/(-4) = (-2 ± sqrt(6))/(-2). Multiplying numerator and denominator by -1, we get (2 ∓ sqrt(6))/2. So the roots are x = (2 - sqrt(6))/2 and x = (2 + sqrt(6))/2. Simplifying further: x = 1 - (sqrt(6)/2) and x = 1 + (sqrt(6)/2). Since sqrt(6) is approximately 2.45, so sqrt(6)/2 is about 1.225. Therefore, the roots are approximately 1 - 1.225 = -0.225 and 1 + 1.225 = 2.225.Since the quadratic opens downward (because a = -2), the graph is above zero between the roots. So the solution to the inequality -2x² + 4x + 1 ≥ 0 is x between -0.225 and 2.225. In terms of the author's narrative, this range might suggest that within this interval, the probability remains above the existential threshold of 2, representing a stable or certain perception of reality. Outside this range, the probability drops below 2, indicating existential uncertainty or a breakdown in perception. The author might be exploring how our perception of reality is only certain within specific boundaries, beyond which it becomes uncertain or distorted.I should double-check my calculations. For the vertex, x = -b/(2a) = -4/(2*(-2)) = 1, correct. P(1) = 5, correct. For the inequality, solving -2x² +4x +3 ≥ 2 gives -2x² +4x +1 ≥0. Quadratic formula: x = [-4 ± sqrt(16 + 8)]/(-4) = [-4 ± sqrt(24)]/(-4). Which simplifies to (4 ∓ sqrt(24))/4 = (4 ∓ 2sqrt(6))/4 = (2 ∓ sqrt(6))/2, which is the same as 1 ∓ sqrt(6)/2. So yes, approximately -0.225 and 2.225. Since the parabola opens downward, the inequality holds between the roots. So the range is from approximately -0.225 to 2.225.I think that's all correct. So summarizing:Sub-problem 1: The maximum probability is 5 at x=1.Sub-problem 2: The probability is ≥2 when x is between approximately -0.225 and 2.225.**Final Answer**Sub-problem 1: The maximum probability occurs at ( x = boxed{1} ).Sub-problem 2: The range of ( x ) where ( P(x) geq 2 ) is ( boxed{left[1 - frac{sqrt{6}}{2}, 1 + frac{sqrt{6}}{2}right]} )."},{"question":"A producer, known for his passion for opera and extensive experience in studio recordings, is planning to record a new opera album. The album consists of several arias, each requiring a different amount of studio time. Let ( x ) represent the number of hours spent recording each aria. The producer has a total of 100 studio hours available for recording.1. The producer notices that the time ( x ) spent recording each aria follows a quadratic pattern given by the equation ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ). Solve this equation to find the possible values of ( x ).2. If one of the roots of the equation in part 1 is chosen as the recording time for each aria, and the producer decides to record 5 arias, determine if the total recording time for these arias will fit within the available 100 studio hours.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a producer recording an opera album. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, part 1 says that the time spent recording each aria follows a quadratic equation: ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ). I need to solve this equation to find the possible values of ( x ). Hmm, quadratic equations. I remember they can be solved by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me see if this one factors nicely.Looking at ( x^2 - 6x + 8 ), I need two numbers that multiply to 8 and add up to -6. Let me think: factors of 8 are 1 and 8, 2 and 4. 2 and 4 add up to 6. But since the middle term is -6x, both numbers should be negative. So, -2 and -4 multiply to 8 and add up to -6. Perfect!So, factoring the quadratic, it becomes:( (x - 2)(x - 4) = 0 )Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:( x - 2 = 0 ) => ( x = 2 )( x - 4 = 0 ) => ( x = 4 )So, the possible values of ( x ) are 2 and 4 hours per aria.Moving on to part 2. It says that if one of the roots is chosen as the recording time for each aria, and the producer decides to record 5 arias, we need to determine if the total recording time will fit within the available 100 studio hours.Okay, so first, the roots are 2 and 4. The producer can choose either 2 or 4 hours per aria. If he chooses 2 hours per aria, then for 5 arias, the total time would be ( 5 times 2 = 10 ) hours. If he chooses 4 hours per aria, then the total time would be ( 5 times 4 = 20 ) hours.Wait, but the total studio hours available are 100. So, 10 or 20 hours are both way below 100. That seems too easy. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.Let me read it again: \\"If one of the roots of the equation in part 1 is chosen as the recording time for each aria, and the producer decides to record 5 arias, determine if the total recording time for these arias will fit within the available 100 studio hours.\\"Hmm, so if each aria takes either 2 or 4 hours, and he records 5 arias, each taking the same amount of time. So, 5 times 2 is 10, 5 times 4 is 20. Both are much less than 100. So, yes, it will fit.But wait, maybe the quadratic equation is modeling something else. The equation is ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ), which gives x=2 and x=4. But is x representing the time per aria, or is it something else?Wait, the problem says: \\"the time ( x ) spent recording each aria follows a quadratic pattern given by the equation ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ).\\" So, x is the time per aria, and the equation is satisfied by x=2 and x=4. So, each aria can take either 2 or 4 hours. So, if he chooses one of the roots, meaning he picks either 2 or 4 as the time per aria, and then records 5 arias, each taking that time.So, as I calculated before, 5 arias at 2 hours each is 10 hours total, which is way under 100. Similarly, 5 arias at 4 hours each is 20 hours, still under 100. So, in both cases, the total time is well within the 100-hour limit.But wait, maybe the equation is not giving possible times per aria, but rather the total time? Let me check the wording again: \\"the time ( x ) spent recording each aria follows a quadratic pattern given by the equation ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ).\\" So, x is per aria, so each aria's time satisfies that equation. So, each aria takes either 2 or 4 hours.Alternatively, maybe the equation is modeling the total time? But that seems less likely because it says \\"the time ( x ) spent recording each aria.\\" So, each aria's time is a solution to that equation, so each aria is either 2 or 4 hours. So, if he records 5 arias, each taking 2 or 4 hours, the total time is either 10 or 20 hours, both of which are less than 100.Wait, but maybe the equation is for the total time? Let me think. If x is the total time, then ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ) would give total times of 2 or 4 hours, but that doesn't make sense because the total time is 100 hours. So, no, that can't be.Alternatively, maybe the equation is for the number of arias? But the problem says \\"the time ( x ) spent recording each aria,\\" so x is per aria.Wait, another thought: maybe the quadratic equation is modeling the relationship between the number of arias and the time? But the equation is in terms of x, which is the time per aria. So, each aria's time is either 2 or 4 hours.So, if he records 5 arias, each taking 2 hours, total is 10. Each taking 4 hours, total is 20. Both are under 100. So, yes, it will fit.But maybe the problem is more complex. Maybe the quadratic equation is not just giving possible times, but the time per aria is a function of something else? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify. It just says the time x follows that quadratic equation. So, I think the straightforward interpretation is that each aria's time is either 2 or 4 hours.Therefore, for 5 arias, total time is either 10 or 20 hours, both less than 100. So, it will fit.Wait, but maybe the producer is choosing a different root for each aria? But the problem says \\"one of the roots of the equation in part 1 is chosen as the recording time for each aria.\\" So, he picks one root, either 2 or 4, and uses that for all 5 arias. So, either all 5 arias take 2 hours each, or all 5 take 4 hours each.So, total time is either 10 or 20, both under 100. So, yes, it fits.But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the equation is modeling something else. Let me think again.The equation is ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ), where x is the time per aria. So, each aria's time is a solution to this equation, which are 2 and 4. So, each aria is either 2 or 4 hours. So, if he records 5 arias, each taking 2 or 4 hours, but he can choose either 2 or 4 for each aria? Or does he have to choose one time for all arias?The problem says: \\"If one of the roots of the equation in part 1 is chosen as the recording time for each aria...\\" So, he chooses one root, either 2 or 4, and uses that as the time for each aria. So, all 5 arias take the same amount of time, either 2 or 4 hours.Therefore, total time is 5*2=10 or 5*4=20, both less than 100. So, yes, it fits.But wait, maybe the equation is modeling the total time? Let me check again.Wait, the equation is ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ), where x is the time per aria. So, each aria's time is a solution to this equation, meaning each aria is either 2 or 4 hours. So, if he records 5 arias, each taking 2 or 4 hours, but he can choose either 2 or 4 for each aria. But the problem says \\"one of the roots is chosen as the recording time for each aria,\\" which implies that he picks one root and uses it for all arias. So, all arias are either 2 or 4 hours.Therefore, total time is 10 or 20, both under 100. So, yes, it fits.Wait, but maybe the quadratic equation is not about per aria time, but about something else. Let me read the problem again.\\"A producer, known for his passion for opera and extensive experience in studio recordings, is planning to record a new opera album. The album consists of several arias, each requiring a different amount of studio time. Let ( x ) represent the number of hours spent recording each aria.

The producer notices that the time ( x ) spent recording each aria follows a quadratic pattern given by the equation ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ). Solve this equation to find the possible values of ( x ).2. If one of the roots of the equation in part 1 is chosen as the recording time for each aria, and the producer decides to record 5 arias, determine if the total recording time for these arias will fit within the available 100 studio hours.\\"So, x is the time per aria, each aria's time is a solution to the quadratic equation, which are 2 and 4. So, each aria is either 2 or 4 hours. Then, for 5 arias, if he chooses one root, say 2, then total time is 10. If he chooses 4, total is 20. Both are under 100.Therefore, the answer is yes, it will fit.But wait, maybe the equation is not per aria, but total? Let me think. If x is the total time, then the equation would be ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ), giving x=2 or x=4. But the total time is 100, so that doesn't make sense. So, no, x must be per aria.Alternatively, maybe the equation is modeling the number of arias? But the problem says x is the time per aria, so that's not it.So, I think the answer is yes, the total time will fit within 100 hours.But wait, maybe the equation is for the number of arias? Let me check.Wait, the equation is ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ), where x is the time per aria. So, each aria's time is 2 or 4 hours. So, if he records 5 arias, each taking 2 or 4 hours, but he can choose either 2 or 4 for each aria.

So, all arias are either 2 or 4 hours.Therefore, total time is 10 or 20, both under 100. So, yes, it fits.Wait, but maybe the equation is modeling the total time? Let me think again.If x is the total time, then the equation would be ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ), giving x=2 or x=4. But the total time is 100, so that can't be. So, x must be per aria.Therefore, the answer is yes, the total time will fit within 100 hours.But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just go with the straightforward interpretation.So, part 1: solve ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ). Factored as (x-2)(x-4)=0, so x=2 or x=4.Part 2: if one root is chosen as the time per aria, and he records 5 arias, total time is 5*2=10 or 5*4=20, both less than 100. So, yes, it fits.Therefore, the answers are:1. x=2 and x=4.2. Yes, the total time will fit.But wait, the problem says \\"each aria requiring a different amount of studio time.\\" Wait, does that mean each aria has a different time? So, maybe not all arias take the same time. But the equation gives two possible times, 2 and 4. So, maybe some arias take 2, some take 4.But the problem says \\"one of the roots is chosen as the recording time for each aria,\\" which could mean that each aria is assigned one of the roots, so some arias take 2, others take 4. But the problem says \\"one of the roots is chosen as the recording time for each aria,\\" which might mean that for each aria, you choose one root, but you can choose different roots for different arias.Wait, but the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \\"If one of the roots of the equation in part 1 is chosen as the recording time for each aria, and the producer decides to record 5 arias, determine if the total recording time for these arias will fit within the available 100 studio hours.\\"So, \\"one of the roots is chosen as the recording time for each aria.\\" So, for each aria, you choose one root, but you can choose different roots for different arias. So, for example, some arias could be 2 hours, others 4 hours.But the problem doesn't specify how many of each. So, the total time could vary depending on how many arias are 2 hours and how many are 4 hours.Wait, but the problem says \\"the producer decides to record 5 arias.\\" It doesn't specify how many of each time. So, the total time could be anywhere from 5*2=10 to 5*4=20 hours. So, regardless of the combination, the total time is between 10 and 20, both well under 100.Therefore, yes, it will fit.But wait, maybe the problem is implying that all arias take the same time, as in, he picks one root and uses it for all arias. So, either all 5 arias take 2 hours, or all take 4 hours. So, total time is 10 or 20, both under 100.Either way, the total time is under 100.So, the answer is yes.But wait, another thought: maybe the quadratic equation is modeling the total time for all arias. So, if x is the total time, then ( x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 ) would give x=2 or x=4. But the total time available is 100, so that can't be. So, x must be per aria.Therefore, the conclusion is that each aria takes either 2 or 4 hours, and for 5 arias, the total time is between 10 and 20 hours, both under 100. So, it fits.Therefore, the answers are:1. The possible values of x are 2 and 4 hours.2. Yes, the total recording time will fit within the available 100 studio hours."},{"question":"A warehouse worker named Alex suffered a serious injury due to inadequate safety measures. Before the injury, Alex was responsible for operating a forklift to load and unload crates. The injury required Alex to undergo rehabilitation, which took him out of work for several weeks. The warehouse management wants to determine the cost of this incident and improve safety measures to prevent future occurrences.1. After the injury, the warehouse had to hire temporary workers to cover Alex's shifts. If the cost of hiring a temporary worker is 150 per day, and the temporary worker worked 'x' days, express the total cost in terms of 'x'. Then, find the number of days, 'x', that the temporary worker worked if the total cost for hiring them was 4,500.2. To improve safety measures, the warehouse decides to invest in safety equipment and training. If the total budget for safety improvement is 10,000 and the cost can be represented by the quadratic equation (C(x) = 500x^2 - 3000x + 4000), where 'x' is the number of new safety protocols implemented, determine the range of 'x' that ensures the cost does not exceed the budget.","answer":"First, I need to determine the total cost of hiring temporary workers. The cost per day is 150, and the worker was hired for 'x' days. So, the total cost is simply 150 multiplied by x, which gives the equation C = 150x.Next, to find out how many days the temporary worker was employed when the total cost was 4,500, I'll set up the equation 150x = 4,500 and solve for x. Dividing both sides by 150 gives x = 30. Therefore, the temporary worker worked for 30 days.Moving on to the safety improvement budget, the total budget is 10,000, and the cost is represented by the quadratic equation C(x) = 500x² - 3000x + 4000. To ensure the cost does not exceed the budget, I need to solve the inequality 500x² - 3000x + 4000 ≤ 10,000.Subtracting 10,000 from both sides gives 500x² - 3000x - 6000 ≤ 0. Dividing the entire equation by 500 simplifies it to x² - 6x - 12 ≤ 0. To find the critical points, I'll solve the equation x² - 6x - 12 = 0 using the quadratic formula. The solutions are x = 3 + √21 and x = 3 - √21.Since the number of safety protocols implemented cannot be negative, I'll consider the positive solution, which is approximately x = 6.583. Therefore, the range of x that ensures the cost does not exceed the budget is from 0 to approximately 6.583."},{"question":"An elderly resident of Indiana, who loves sharing stories about the state's rich history, has a collection of old coins that he claims date back to various significant events in Indiana's past.

Determine the time when the attendance will be at its maximum and find the maximum expected attendance.","answer":"Alright, so I've got these two math problems to solve, and I need to figure them out step by step. Let me take them one at a time.Starting with the first problem: The mayor wants to produce flyers and buttons with a total budget of 1,500. Each flyer costs 0.50, and each button costs 1.25. She wants to produce twice as many flyers as buttons. I need to find out how many of each she can make without exceeding the budget.Okay, let's break this down. Let me denote the number of buttons as B. Since she wants twice as many flyers as buttons, the number of flyers would be 2B. That makes sense because if buttons are B, flyers are double that.Now, the cost for the buttons would be the number of buttons multiplied by the cost per button. So that's B * 1.25. Similarly, the cost for the flyers would be 2B * 0.50. The total cost should add up to 1,500.So, putting that into an equation: Cost of buttons + Cost of flyers = Total budgetWhich translates to:1.25B + 0.50*(2B) = 1500Let me compute that. First, simplify the equation:1.25B + 0.50*2B = 15000.50*2B is 1.00B, so:1.25B + 1.00B = 1500Adding those together:2.25B = 1500Now, to find B, I need to divide both sides by 2.25:B = 1500 / 2.25Hmm, let me calculate that. 1500 divided by 2.25. Well, 2.25 goes into 1500 how many times?Alternatively, I can think of 2.25 as 9/4, so dividing by 9/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/9.So, 1500 * (4/9) = ?1500 divided by 9 is 166.666..., and then multiplied by 4 is 666.666...Wait, that can't be right because 2.25 times 666.666 is 1500.But wait, 2.25 * 666.666 is indeed 1500 because 2.25 * 666 = 1500 - 2.25*0.666 ≈ 1500 - 1.5 = 1498.5, which is close but not exact. Maybe I should do it more accurately.Alternatively, 2.25B = 1500So, B = 1500 / 2.25Let me compute 1500 divided by 2.25.2.25 goes into 15 six times because 2.25*6=13.5. Wait, no, that's for 15 divided by 2.25. Wait, I'm getting confused.Wait, 2.25 * 100 = 225, so 2.25 * 600 = 1350, because 225*6=1350.Then, 1500 - 1350 = 150.So, 2.25 goes into 150 how many times?2.25*60=135, so 60 times with a remainder of 15.Wait, 150 - 135=15.So, 2.25 goes into 15 six times because 2.25*6=13.5, but wait, 15 is left, so 2.25*6=13.5, so 15-13.5=1.5.Wait, this is getting messy. Maybe a better way is to multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals.So, 1500 / 2.25 = (1500*100)/(2.25*100) = 150000 / 225Now, 225 goes into 150000 how many times?225 * 600 = 135,000Subtract that from 150,000: 150,000 - 135,000 = 15,000225 goes into 15,000 how many times?225 * 60 = 13,500Subtract: 15,000 - 13,500 = 1,500225 goes into 1,500 exactly 6 times because 225*6=1,350. Wait, no, 225*6=1,350, which is less than 1,500. Wait, 225*6=1,350, so 1,500 - 1,350=150.Wait, this is still not clean. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.Wait, 225*666=?Wait, 225*600=135,000225*60=13,500225*6=1,350So, 600+60+6=666, and 135,000+13,500+1,350=149,850So, 225*666=149,850Subtract that from 150,000: 150,000 - 149,850=150So, 225 goes into 150 two-thirds of a time because 225*(2/3)=150.So, total is 666 + 2/3 ≈ 666.666...So, B=666.666...But since we can't produce a fraction of a button, we need to round down to 666 buttons, but then check if that uses the entire budget.Wait, but 666 buttons would cost 666*1.25=832.50Flyers would be 2*666=1332 flyers, costing 1332*0.50=666.00Total cost: 832.50 + 666.00=1,498.50, which is 1.50 short of the budget.Hmm, so maybe we need to adjust. Alternatively, perhaps the exact number is 666.666..., which is 666 and 2/3 buttons, but since we can't have a fraction, maybe the problem expects us to use fractions or perhaps it's okay to have a decimal answer.Wait, the problem says \\"to use the entire budget,\\" so maybe it's expecting an exact number, which would be 666 and 2/3 buttons and 1333 and 1/3 flyers. But that might not make sense in real life because you can't produce a fraction of a button or flyer.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.Wait, let me double-check the setup.Number of buttons: BNumber of flyers: 2BCost of buttons: 1.25BCost of flyers: 0.50*2B=1.00BTotal cost: 1.25B + 1.00B=2.25B=1500So, B=1500/2.25=666.666...Yes, that's correct. So, the exact number is 666 and 2/3 buttons, but since we can't produce a fraction, perhaps the problem expects us to express it as a fraction or maybe it's okay to have a decimal.Alternatively, maybe I should present it as 666 buttons and 1332 flyers, which would cost 1,498.50, leaving a remainder of 1.50, but the problem says to use the entire budget, so perhaps we need to adjust.Wait, maybe I can produce 667 buttons and 1334 flyers.Let's check the cost:667 buttons: 667*1.25=833.751334 flyers: 1334*0.50=667.00Total: 833.75 + 667.00=1,500.75, which is over the budget by 0.75.Hmm, that's over. Alternatively, 666 buttons and 1333 flyers:666*1.25=832.501333*0.50=666.50Total: 832.50 + 666.50=1,499.00, which is 1.00 short.Hmm, so neither 666 nor 667 buttons will exactly use the budget. So, perhaps the problem expects us to use fractions, even though in reality you can't produce a fraction of a button or flyer. So, maybe the answer is 666 and 2/3 buttons and 1333 and 1/3 flyers.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.Wait, let me try another approach. Let me denote the number of buttons as B, and flyers as F.Given that F=2B.Total cost: 0.50F + 1.25B=1500Substitute F=2B:0.50*(2B) + 1.25B=1500Which simplifies to:1.00B + 1.25B=2.25B=1500So, B=1500/2.25=666.666...So, same result. So, perhaps the answer is 666 and 2/3 buttons and 1333 and 1/3 flyers.But since we can't produce fractions, maybe the problem expects us to express it as exact numbers, even if they are fractions.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use exact decimal numbers, so 666.67 buttons and 1333.33 flyers, but that's also not precise.Wait, maybe I should present it as 666 and 2/3 buttons and 1333 and 1/3 flyers, which is exact.So, in terms of the answer, perhaps we can write it as 666 2/3 buttons and 1333 1/3 flyers.But let me check if that's correct.666 2/3 buttons: 666 + 2/3=666.666...1.25*666.666...=833.333...1333 1/3 flyers: 1333.333...0.50*1333.333...=666.666...Total cost: 833.333... + 666.666...=1,500 exactly.Yes, that works. So, the exact number is 666 and 2/3 buttons and 1333 and 1/3 flyers.But in reality, you can't produce a fraction, so perhaps the problem expects us to use exact numbers, even if they are fractions, or maybe it's a trick question where the numbers work out perfectly.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check again.Wait, 2.25B=1500, so B=1500/2.25.Let me compute 1500 divided by 2.25.2.25 is equal to 9/4, so 1500 divided by 9/4 is 1500*(4/9)= (1500/9)*4.1500 divided by 9 is 166.666..., so 166.666...*4=666.666...Yes, same result.So, I think the answer is 666 and 2/3 buttons and 1333 and 1/3 flyers.But since the problem says \\"to use the entire budget,\\" perhaps it's acceptable to have fractional numbers, even though in reality you can't produce a fraction. So, I'll go with that.Now, moving on to the second problem.The mayor expects attendance to follow a quadratic trend modeled by A(t) = -2t² +24t +100, where A(t) is the expected attendance and t is the time in hours from the start of the rally. I need to find the time when attendance is at its maximum and the maximum expected attendance.Okay, so this is a quadratic function in the form of A(t) = at² + bt + c, where a=-2, b=24, c=100.Since the coefficient of t² is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.The time t at which the maximum occurs is given by the vertex formula: t = -b/(2a)So, plugging in the values:t = -24/(2*(-2)) = -24/(-4) = 6So, the maximum attendance occurs at t=6 hours.Now, to find the maximum attendance, plug t=6 into A(t):A(6) = -2*(6)² +24*(6) +100Compute each term:-2*(36) = -7224*6=144So, A(6)= -72 +144 +100Adding them up:-72 +144=7272 +100=172So, the maximum attendance is 172 people.Wait, let me double-check the calculation:A(6)= -2*(6)^2 +24*6 +100= -2*36 +144 +100= -72 +144 +100= (144-72) +100=72 +100=172Yes, that's correct.So, the maximum attendance is at t=6 hours, with 172 attendees.Wait, but let me think again. The function is A(t) = -2t² +24t +100. So, the vertex is at t=6, and A(6)=172.Yes, that seems right.Alternatively, I can complete the square to verify.Starting with A(t)= -2t² +24t +100Factor out -2 from the first two terms:A(t)= -2(t² -12t) +100Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses:Take half of -12, which is -6, square it: (-6)^2=36So, add and subtract 36 inside the parentheses:A(t)= -2[(t² -12t +36 -36)] +100= -2[(t-6)^2 -36] +100= -2(t-6)^2 +72 +100= -2(t-6)^2 +172So, the vertex form is A(t)= -2(t-6)^2 +172, which confirms that the maximum occurs at t=6, and the maximum attendance is 172.Yes, that's correct.So, to summarize:1. The mayor should produce 666 and 2/3 buttons and 1333 and 1/3 flyers to use the entire budget.2. The maximum attendance occurs at 6 hours after the start of the rally, with 172 attendees expected.Wait, but for the first problem, the numbers are fractional, which might not be practical. Maybe the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number, but then the budget wouldn't be exactly used. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.Wait, let me check the first problem again.If B=666.666..., then F=2B=1333.333...Total cost: 666.666...*1.25 +1333.333...*0.50Compute each:666.666...*1.25: 666.666...*1=666.666..., 666.666...*0.25=166.666..., so total is 666.666...+166.666...=833.333...1333.333...*0.50=666.666...Total cost:833.333...+666.666...=1,500 exactly.So, yes, the exact numbers are 666 2/3 buttons and 1333 1/3 flyers.But in reality, you can't produce a fraction, so perhaps the problem expects us to use exact numbers, even if they are fractions, or maybe it's a trick question where the numbers work out perfectly.Alternatively, perhaps I should present the answer as 666 buttons and 1333 flyers, which would be 1,498.50, leaving 1.50 unspent, but the problem says to use the entire budget, so that might not be acceptable.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use exact numbers, even if they are fractions, so I'll go with that.So, the answers are:1. 666 2/3 buttons and 1333 1/3 flyers.2. Maximum attendance at 6 hours with 172 attendees.I think that's it."},{"question":"A supportive mom is planning a reward system to encourage her child during potty training. She decides to use stickers as a positive reinforcement. She has a total of 60 stickers to distribute over the course of the training. She wants to use a polynomial equation to determine how many stickers to give based on the number of successful days.1. Let ( x ) represent the number of successful potty training days. The mom decides to create a polynomial function ( S(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), where ( S(x) ) is the number of stickers given after ( x ) successful days. She wants to ensure that after 5 successful days, the child receives 20 stickers, and after 10 successful days, the child receives 50 stickers. If the mom gives 2 stickers on the first successful day, find the values of ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ).2. Once the polynomial function is determined, the mom realizes she needs to ensure the child receives at least 5 stickers every day. Determine the range of successful days ( x ) for which the average number of stickers received per day, ( frac{S(x)}{x} ), is at least 5.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where a mom is using a polynomial function to determine how many stickers to give her child during potty training. The function is a quadratic, which is S(x) = ax² + bx + c. She has some conditions: after 5 successful days, the child gets 20 stickers; after 10 days, 50 stickers; and on the first day, 2 stickers. I need to find the coefficients a, b, and c.First, let's break down the information given:1. On day 1 (x=1), S(1) = 2.2. On day 5 (x=5), S(5) = 20.3. On day 10 (x=10), S(10) = 50.So, we have three points that the quadratic function must pass through: (1,2), (5,20), and (10,50). Since it's a quadratic, we can set up a system of equations using these points.Let's write out the equations:1. For x=1: a(1)² + b(1) + c = 2 => a + b + c = 2.2. For x=5: a(5)² + b(5) + c = 20 => 25a + 5b + c = 20.3. For x=10: a(10)² + b(10) + c = 50 => 100a + 10b + c = 50.Now, we have three equations:1. a + b + c = 2. (Equation 1)2. 25a + 5b + c = 20. (Equation 2)3. 100a + 10b + c = 50. (Equation 3)I need to solve this system of equations to find a, b, and c.Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate c:Equation 2 - Equation 1: (25a + 5b + c) - (a + b + c) = 20 - 2.Calculating that:25a - a = 24a5b - b = 4bc - c = 020 - 2 = 18So, 24a + 4b = 18. Let's simplify this by dividing both sides by 2:12a + 2b = 9. (Equation 4)Similarly, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:Equation 3 - Equation 2: (100a + 10b + c) - (25a + 5b + c) = 50 - 20.Calculating that:100a - 25a = 75a10b - 5b = 5bc - c = 050 - 20 = 30So, 75a + 5b = 30. Let's simplify this by dividing both sides by 5:15a + b = 6. (Equation 5)Now, we have Equation 4: 12a + 2b = 9And Equation 5: 15a + b = 6Let me solve Equation 5 for b:b = 6 - 15a.Now, substitute this into Equation 4:12a + 2*(6 - 15a) = 9Let's compute:12a + 12 - 30a = 9Combine like terms:(12a - 30a) + 12 = 9-18a + 12 = 9Subtract 12 from both sides:-18a = -3Divide both sides by -18:a = (-3)/(-18) = 1/6.So, a = 1/6.Now, substitute a back into Equation 5 to find b:15*(1/6) + b = 615/6 is 2.5, so:2.5 + b = 6Subtract 2.5 from both sides:b = 6 - 2.5 = 3.5So, b = 3.5, which is 7/2.Now, substitute a and b into Equation 1 to find c:(1/6) + (7/2) + c = 2First, let's convert to sixths to add them:1/6 + 21/6 + c = 222/6 + c = 2Simplify 22/6 to 11/3:11/3 + c = 2Subtract 11/3 from both sides:c = 2 - 11/3 = (6/3 - 11/3) = (-5/3)So, c = -5/3.Wait, let me double-check that:1/6 + 7/2 + c = 2Convert 1/6 and 7/2 to sixths:1/6 + 21/6 = 22/6 = 11/3.So, 11/3 + c = 2. 2 is 6/3, so 6/3 - 11/3 = -5/3. Yep, that's correct.So, the coefficients are:a = 1/6b = 7/2c = -5/3Let me write the function:S(x) = (1/6)x² + (7/2)x - 5/3.Let me check if this works for the given points.First, x=1:(1/6)(1) + (7/2)(1) - 5/3 = 1/6 + 7/2 - 5/3Convert to sixths:1/6 + 21/6 - 10/6 = (1 + 21 - 10)/6 = 12/6 = 2. Correct.x=5:(1/6)(25) + (7/2)(5) - 5/325/6 + 35/2 - 5/3Convert to sixths:25/6 + 105/6 - 10/6 = (25 + 105 - 10)/6 = 120/6 = 20. Correct.x=10:(1/6)(100) + (7/2)(10) - 5/3100/6 + 70/2 - 5/3Simplify:50/3 + 35 - 5/3Convert 35 to thirds: 35 = 105/3So, 50/3 + 105/3 - 5/3 = (50 + 105 - 5)/3 = 150/3 = 50. Correct.Alright, so the coefficients are correct.Now, moving on to part 2: The mom wants to ensure the child receives at least 5 stickers every day on average. That is, the average number of stickers per day, which is S(x)/x, should be at least 5.So, we need to find the range of x for which S(x)/x ≥ 5.Given that S(x) = (1/6)x² + (7/2)x - 5/3.So, S(x)/x = (1/6)x + 7/2 - 5/(3x).We need (1/6)x + 7/2 - 5/(3x) ≥ 5.Let me write that inequality:(1/6)x + 7/2 - 5/(3x) ≥ 5.Let me subtract 5 from both sides:(1/6)x + 7/2 - 5/(3x) - 5 ≥ 0.Simplify 7/2 - 5:7/2 - 10/2 = (-3)/2.So, the inequality becomes:(1/6)x - 3/2 - 5/(3x) ≥ 0.Let me write it as:(1/6)x - 3/2 - 5/(3x) ≥ 0.To make this easier, let's multiply both sides by 6x to eliminate denominators. However, we have to be careful about the sign of x. Since x represents the number of successful days, x must be a positive integer (1,2,3,...). So, multiplying by 6x won't change the inequality direction.Multiplying each term by 6x:6x*(1/6)x - 6x*(3/2) - 6x*(5/(3x)) ≥ 0.Simplify each term:6x*(1/6)x = x²6x*(3/2) = 9x6x*(5/(3x)) = 10So, the inequality becomes:x² - 9x - 10 ≥ 0.So, we have x² - 9x - 10 ≥ 0.Let me solve the quadratic inequality x² - 9x - 10 ≥ 0.First, find the roots of the quadratic equation x² - 9x - 10 = 0.Using the quadratic formula:x = [9 ± sqrt(81 + 40)] / 2 = [9 ± sqrt(121)] / 2 = [9 ± 11]/2.So, the roots are:(9 + 11)/2 = 20/2 = 10(9 - 11)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.So, the quadratic can be factored as (x - 10)(x + 1) ≥ 0.Now, the critical points are x = -1 and x = 10.We can analyze the sign of the quadratic in the intervals determined by these roots: (-∞, -1), (-1, 10), and (10, ∞).Since x represents the number of days, x must be positive. So, we only consider x > 0.In the interval (0,10), let's pick x=5:(5 - 10)(5 + 1) = (-5)(6) = -30 < 0.In the interval (10, ∞), let's pick x=11:(11 - 10)(11 + 1) = (1)(12) = 12 > 0.So, the inequality x² - 9x -10 ≥ 0 holds when x ≤ -1 or x ≥ 10. But since x is positive, we only consider x ≥ 10.But wait, let's think about this. The inequality is x² - 9x -10 ≥ 0, which is satisfied for x ≤ -1 or x ≥ 10. Since x is positive, the solution is x ≥ 10.But wait, let's verify with the original inequality.Wait, when x=10, S(10)/10 = 50/10 = 5, which is exactly 5. So, x=10 is included.What about x=11? Let's compute S(11)/11.First, compute S(11):S(11) = (1/6)(121) + (7/2)(11) - 5/3.Calculate each term:121/6 ≈ 20.166777/2 = 38.5-5/3 ≈ -1.6667Add them together:20.1667 + 38.5 - 1.6667 ≈ 57.So, S(11) ≈ 57.57/11 ≈ 5.18, which is greater than 5.Similarly, x=9:Compute S(9)/9.S(9) = (1/6)(81) + (7/2)(9) - 5/3.81/6 = 13.563/2 = 31.5-5/3 ≈ -1.6667Total: 13.5 + 31.5 - 1.6667 ≈ 43.333343.3333/9 ≈ 4.8148, which is less than 5.So, at x=9, the average is less than 5, and at x=10, it's exactly 5.Therefore, the range of x where S(x)/x ≥ 5 is x ≥ 10.But wait, let's check x=0, but x=0 is not applicable because the child hasn't had any successful days yet.So, the solution is x ≥ 10.But wait, let me double-check the inequality.We had:(1/6)x + 7/2 - 5/(3x) ≥ 5Which simplified to x² - 9x -10 ≥ 0.Which is true for x ≤ -1 or x ≥ 10.Since x is positive, x ≥ 10.So, the range is x ≥ 10.But let me think again: is the average number of stickers per day at least 5 starting from x=10?Yes, because at x=10, it's exactly 5, and beyond that, it increases.Wait, let me check the behavior of S(x)/x as x increases.Since S(x) is a quadratic function, S(x)/x is (1/6)x + 7/2 - 5/(3x). As x increases, the term (1/6)x dominates, so S(x)/x tends to infinity as x increases. Therefore, beyond x=10, the average keeps increasing.But what about for x between 1 and 10? For example, at x=1, S(1)/1=2, which is less than 5. At x=5, S(5)/5=4, still less than 5. At x=10, it's exactly 5.So, the average is only at least 5 when x is 10 or more.Therefore, the range of x is x ≥ 10.But wait, the problem says \\"the child receives at least 5 stickers every day.\\" Wait, does that mean the average per day is at least 5, or the total is at least 5? The problem says \\"the average number of stickers received per day, S(x)/x, is at least 5.\\" So, yes, it's the average.So, the answer is x ≥ 10.But let me think if there's any x less than 10 where the average is at least 5.We saw that at x=10, it's exactly 5. For x=9, it's about 4.81, which is less than 5. So, no, there's no x less than 10 where the average is at least 5.Therefore, the range is x ≥ 10.But wait, let me check x=10.5, just to see.Wait, x must be an integer because it's the number of successful days. So, x is a positive integer. Therefore, the range is x=10,11,12,...But the problem doesn't specify whether x must be an integer or not. It just says \\"the number of successful days,\\" which is typically an integer. So, perhaps the answer is x ≥ 10, where x is an integer.But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe we can consider x as a real number greater than or equal to 10.But in the context, x is the number of days, so it's discrete. However, the function S(x) is defined for real x, but the average is calculated for integer x.But the problem says \\"the range of successful days x,\\" so I think it's considering x as a real number, but in reality, x is an integer. Hmm.Wait, the problem says \\"the average number of stickers received per day, S(x)/x, is at least 5.\\" It doesn't specify whether x is an integer or not. So, perhaps we can consider x as a real number greater than or equal to 10.But in the context, x is the number of days, so it's a positive integer. So, the range is x=10,11,12,...But the problem might expect the answer in terms of real numbers, so x ≥10.I think, given the context, it's safer to say x ≥10, as the function is defined for real x, and the inequality holds for x ≥10.Therefore, the range is x ≥10.So, summarizing:1. The coefficients are a=1/6, b=7/2, c=-5/3.2. The range of x is x ≥10.**Final Answer**1. The values of ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are ( boxed{frac{1}{6}} ), ( boxed{frac{7}{2}} ), and ( boxed{-frac{5}{3}} ) respectively.2. The range of successful days ( x ) is ( boxed{[10, infty)} )."},{"question":"A history professor is planning a lecture to discuss the impact of war on individuals and communities.

The profit function is given by ( P(x) = -2x^2 + 12x - 16 ).

Solve the inequality ( C(x) leq 8000 ) to find the range of years since his last procedure that will keep the cost within his budget. Note: Assume ( x ) is a non-negative integer.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an actor considering a cosmetic surgery procedure, and the cost is modeled by the polynomial function ( C(x) = 5000 + 200x - 15x^2 ). There are two parts to this problem. Let me try to figure them out step by step.First, part 1 asks me to determine the number of years since the actor's last procedure that will minimize the cost of the surgery. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the value of ( x ) that minimizes ( C(x) ). Since ( C(x) ) is a quadratic function, it should have a parabola shape. The coefficient of ( x^2 ) is -15, which is negative, so the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola will be the maximum point, not the minimum. Wait, that seems contradictory because if the parabola opens downward, the vertex is the highest point, so the minimum would be at the ends of the domain. But hold on, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.Wait, actually, the problem says \\"minimize the cost.\\" If the parabola opens downward, the cost decreases as we move away from the vertex in both directions. But since ( x ) represents the number of years since the last procedure, it can't be negative. So, the domain of ( x ) is ( x geq 0 ). Therefore, the minimum cost would occur either at the vertex or at the boundary of the domain. But since the parabola opens downward, the vertex is the maximum point. So, does that mean the cost decreases as ( x ) increases beyond the vertex? Wait, that doesn't make sense because if you go too far, the cost might start increasing again? Hmm, maybe I need to double-check.Wait, let me think again. The function is ( C(x) = -15x^2 + 200x + 5000 ). So, it's a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, which means it opens downward. Therefore, it has a maximum at its vertex. So, the cost will increase as ( x ) moves away from the vertex in either direction. But since ( x ) can't be negative, the minimum cost would actually be at the smallest possible ( x ), which is 0. But that doesn't make sense because if he just had the procedure, the cost is 5000, but if he waits a year, the cost becomes ( 5000 + 200(1) -15(1)^2 = 5000 + 200 -15 = 5185 ). So, it's actually increasing as ( x ) increases from 0. Wait, but the vertex is a maximum, so the cost increases as ( x ) moves away from the vertex. So, the maximum cost is at the vertex, and the minimum cost is at the endpoints.But wait, as ( x ) increases beyond the vertex, the cost would start decreasing again? No, because the parabola opens downward, so after the vertex, the cost decreases as ( x ) increases. Wait, that can't be because the coefficient is negative. Let me plot the function mentally. At ( x = 0 ), ( C(0) = 5000 ). At ( x = 1 ), it's 5185. At ( x = 2 ), ( 5000 + 400 - 60 = 5340 ). At ( x = 3 ), ( 5000 + 600 - 135 = 5465 ). Wait, so it's increasing. Then, when does it start decreasing? Let me calculate the vertex.The vertex of a parabola ( ax^2 + bx + c ) is at ( x = -b/(2a) ). Here, ( a = -15 ), ( b = 200 ). So, ( x = -200/(2*(-15)) = -200/(-30) = 200/30 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667 ). So, the vertex is at approximately 6.6667 years. Since the parabola opens downward, this is the maximum point. So, the cost increases until ( x ≈ 6.6667 ) and then decreases after that.But wait, the problem is about minimizing the cost. So, if the cost increases until 6.6667 years and then decreases, the minimum cost would be either at ( x = 0 ) or as ( x ) approaches infinity. But as ( x ) increases beyond 6.6667, the cost decreases, but since ( x ) is the number of years since the last procedure, it can't be negative, but it can be any non-negative integer. So, theoretically, as ( x ) increases, the cost decreases beyond 6.6667. However, in reality, the cost can't be negative, so we need to find where the cost is minimized within the feasible domain.But wait, let's see. The function is ( C(x) = -15x^2 + 200x + 5000 ). As ( x ) increases, the quadratic term dominates, so the cost will eventually become negative, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, the cost function is only valid for a certain range of ( x ) where ( C(x) ) is positive. So, we need to find the range of ( x ) where ( C(x) ) is positive, and within that range, the minimum cost occurs either at the vertex or at the boundaries.But the question is to minimize the cost. So, if the cost decreases as ( x ) increases beyond 6.6667, the minimum cost would be as ( x ) approaches the point where ( C(x) ) becomes zero or negative, but since ( x ) is an integer, we need to find the integer ( x ) where ( C(x) ) is minimized.Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\"minimize the cost of the surgery.\\" So, if the cost function has a maximum at ( x ≈ 6.6667 ), then the cost is minimized at the endpoints. But since ( x ) can be any non-negative integer, the cost at ( x = 0 ) is 5000, and as ( x ) increases, the cost first increases to the vertex and then decreases. So, the minimum cost would be either at ( x = 0 ) or as ( x ) approaches infinity, but since ( x ) is an integer, we need to find the integer ( x ) where ( C(x) ) is minimized.But wait, let's calculate ( C(x) ) for some values beyond 6.6667 to see.At ( x = 6 ): ( C(6) = 5000 + 1200 - 15*36 = 5000 + 1200 - 540 = 5660 ).At ( x = 7 ): ( C(7) = 5000 + 1400 - 15*49 = 5000 + 1400 - 735 = 5665 ).Wait, that's higher than at ( x = 6 ). Hmm, that's strange. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, no. The vertex is at ( x ≈ 6.6667 ), so ( x = 6 ) is before the vertex, and ( x = 7 ) is after. But the cost at ( x = 6 ) is 5660, and at ( x = 7 ) it's 5665. So, actually, the cost is increasing as ( x ) increases beyond 6.6667. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Maybe I need to recalculate.Wait, let's compute ( C(6) ):( C(6) = 5000 + 200*6 -15*(6)^2 = 5000 + 1200 - 15*36 = 5000 + 1200 - 540 = 5660 ).( C(7) = 5000 + 200*7 -15*(7)^2 = 5000 + 1400 - 15*49 = 5000 + 1400 - 735 = 5665 ).Wait, so ( C(7) = 5665 ), which is higher than ( C(6) = 5660 ). So, that suggests that after the vertex, the cost is increasing, which contradicts the idea that the parabola opens downward. Wait, no, the parabola opens downward, so after the vertex, the function should decrease. But in reality, the function is increasing after ( x = 6.6667 ). That can't be right.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the vertex. Let me recalculate the vertex.The vertex is at ( x = -b/(2a) ). Here, ( a = -15 ), ( b = 200 ). So, ( x = -200/(2*(-15)) = -200/(-30) = 200/30 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667 ). So, that's correct.Wait, but then why is ( C(7) ) higher than ( C(6) )? Let me compute ( C(6.6667) ):( C(6.6667) = 5000 + 200*(20/3) -15*(20/3)^2 ).Compute each term:200*(20/3) = 4000/3 ≈ 1333.3333.15*(20/3)^2 = 15*(400/9) = 6000/9 ≈ 666.6667.So, ( C(6.6667) ≈ 5000 + 1333.3333 - 666.6667 ≈ 5000 + 666.6666 ≈ 5666.6666 ).So, at the vertex, the cost is approximately 5666.67.But when I calculated ( C(6) = 5660 ) and ( C(7) = 5665 ), both are close to 5666.67. So, actually, the cost is slightly lower at ( x = 6 ) and slightly higher at ( x = 7 ), which makes sense because the vertex is between 6 and 7.Therefore, the cost is maximized at ( x ≈ 6.6667 ), and as ( x ) moves away from this point, the cost decreases. But since ( x ) is an integer, the minimum cost occurs at the endpoints of the domain. However, as ( x ) increases beyond 6.6667, the cost decreases, but in our calculations, ( C(7) ) is higher than ( C(6) ). Wait, that seems contradictory.Wait, perhaps I need to check higher values of ( x ). Let's compute ( C(10) ):( C(10) = 5000 + 200*10 -15*100 = 5000 + 2000 - 1500 = 5500 ).So, at ( x = 10 ), the cost is 5500, which is lower than at ( x = 6 ) and ( x = 7 ). Hmm, so as ( x ) increases beyond 6.6667, the cost actually decreases. So, the cost is minimized as ( x ) approaches infinity, but since ( x ) is an integer, the cost will keep decreasing as ( x ) increases. But wait, the cost function is quadratic, so it will eventually become negative, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the cost function is only valid for a certain range of ( x ) where ( C(x) ) is positive.So, to find the range where ( C(x) ) is positive, we need to solve ( C(x) = 0 ):( -15x^2 + 200x + 5000 = 0 ).Multiply both sides by -1:( 15x^2 - 200x - 5000 = 0 ).Divide both sides by 5:( 3x^2 - 40x - 1000 = 0 ).Use quadratic formula:( x = [40 ± sqrt(1600 + 12000)] / 6 = [40 ± sqrt(13600)] / 6 ).Compute sqrt(13600):sqrt(13600) = sqrt(100*136) = 10*sqrt(136) ≈ 10*11.6619 ≈ 116.619.So, ( x = [40 + 116.619]/6 ≈ 156.619/6 ≈ 26.103 ).And ( x = [40 - 116.619]/6 ≈ negative value, which we can ignore since ( x ) is non-negative.So, the cost function is positive for ( x ) between 0 and approximately 26.103. Therefore, ( x ) can be from 0 to 26 years.Therefore, the cost function is valid for ( x = 0, 1, 2, ..., 26 ).Now, since the cost function has a maximum at ( x ≈ 6.6667 ), the cost increases from ( x = 0 ) to ( x ≈ 6.6667 ), and then decreases from ( x ≈ 6.6667 ) to ( x ≈ 26.103 ). Therefore, the minimum cost occurs at the endpoints, either at ( x = 0 ) or ( x = 26 ).But wait, at ( x = 0 ), the cost is 5000, and at ( x = 26 ), let's compute ( C(26) ):( C(26) = 5000 + 200*26 -15*(26)^2 ).Compute each term:200*26 = 5200.15*(26)^2 = 15*676 = 10140.So, ( C(26) = 5000 + 5200 - 10140 = 10200 - 10140 = 60 ).Wait, that's only 60 dollars? That seems extremely low. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.Wait, let's compute ( C(26) ):First, ( x = 26 ).( C(26) = 5000 + 200*26 -15*(26)^2 ).Compute 200*26: 200*20=4000, 200*6=1200, so total 5200.Compute 15*(26)^2: 26^2=676, 15*676=10140.So, ( C(26) = 5000 + 5200 - 10140 = 10200 - 10140 = 60 ).Yes, that's correct. So, at ( x = 26 ), the cost is 60 dollars. That's way lower than at ( x = 0 ). So, the minimum cost is 60 dollars at ( x = 26 ). But that seems unrealistic because the cost can't be that low. Maybe the model is only valid up to a certain point.But according to the model, ( C(x) ) is 60 at ( x = 26 ). So, if we consider the model as given, the minimum cost occurs at ( x = 26 ). But wait, the problem says \\"the number of years since the actor's last procedure that will minimize the cost.\\" So, is it 26 years? That seems like a long time, but according to the model, that's where the cost is minimized.But let me check ( x = 25 ):( C(25) = 5000 + 200*25 -15*(25)^2 ).Compute each term:200*25 = 5000.15*(25)^2 = 15*625 = 9375.So, ( C(25) = 5000 + 5000 - 9375 = 10000 - 9375 = 625 ).So, at ( x = 25 ), the cost is 625, which is higher than at ( x = 26 ). Similarly, at ( x = 27 ):Wait, but ( x = 27 ) is beyond the root we found earlier (26.103), so ( C(27) ) would be negative, which is invalid. So, the last valid ( x ) is 26, where the cost is 60.Therefore, according to the model, the minimum cost occurs at ( x = 26 ) years, with a cost of 60 dollars. But that seems unrealistic, but perhaps the model is just a mathematical function without considering real-world constraints.However, the problem says \\"the number of years since the actor's last procedure that will minimize the cost.\\" So, based on the model, it's 26 years. But wait, the vertex is at 6.6667, which is a maximum, so the cost is minimized at the endpoints. Since ( x = 0 ) gives 5000 and ( x = 26 ) gives 60, the minimum is at ( x = 26 ).But wait, another thought: maybe the model is only valid for a certain range, and beyond that, it's not applicable. But the problem doesn't specify any constraints on ( x ) other than being a non-negative integer. So, according to the given function, the minimum cost is at ( x = 26 ).But let me think again. The problem says \\"minimize the cost.\\" So, if the cost function is a downward opening parabola, the maximum is at the vertex, and the minimums are at the endpoints. Since ( x ) can be any non-negative integer, the cost can be made as low as possible by increasing ( x ) indefinitely, but in reality, the cost can't be negative. So, the model must have a point where ( C(x) = 0 ), which we found at ( x ≈ 26.103 ). Therefore, the minimum cost is 0 at ( x ≈ 26.103 ), but since ( x ) must be an integer, the minimum positive cost is at ( x = 26 ), which is 60.Therefore, the answer to part 1 is ( x = 26 ) years.Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. If the actor waits 26 years, the cost is only 60 dollars? That doesn't make sense in real life, but perhaps in the model, it's correct.Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the cost function is supposed to have a minimum, not a maximum. Let me check the function again: ( C(x) = 5000 + 200x -15x^2 ). So, it's a quadratic with a negative coefficient on ( x^2 ), so it's a maximum, not a minimum. Therefore, the cost is maximized at the vertex, and minimized at the endpoints.But in this case, as ( x ) increases, the cost decreases after the vertex. So, the minimum cost is at the maximum ( x ) where ( C(x) ) is positive, which is ( x = 26 ).Therefore, the answer to part 1 is 26 years.Wait, but let me check another value, say ( x = 20 ):( C(20) = 5000 + 200*20 -15*(20)^2 = 5000 + 4000 - 6000 = 3000 ).So, at ( x = 20 ), the cost is 3000, which is still higher than at ( x = 26 ). So, yes, the cost keeps decreasing as ( x ) approaches 26.Therefore, I think the answer is 26 years.Now, moving on to part 2: The actor has a budget of 8,000 for the surgery. Solve the inequality ( C(x) leq 8000 ) to find the range of years since his last procedure that will keep the cost within his budget.So, we need to solve ( 5000 + 200x -15x^2 leq 8000 ).Let me rewrite the inequality:( -15x^2 + 200x + 5000 leq 8000 ).Subtract 8000 from both sides:( -15x^2 + 200x + 5000 - 8000 leq 0 ).Simplify:( -15x^2 + 200x - 3000 leq 0 ).Multiply both sides by -1 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):( 15x^2 - 200x + 3000 geq 0 ).Now, let's solve the quadratic inequality ( 15x^2 - 200x + 3000 geq 0 ).First, find the roots of the quadratic equation ( 15x^2 - 200x + 3000 = 0 ).Use quadratic formula:( x = [200 ± sqrt(40000 - 4*15*3000)] / (2*15) ).Compute discriminant:( D = 40000 - 180000 = -140000 ).Wait, the discriminant is negative, which means there are no real roots. Therefore, the quadratic ( 15x^2 - 200x + 3000 ) is always positive because the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive. Therefore, the inequality ( 15x^2 - 200x + 3000 geq 0 ) is always true for all real ( x ).But that can't be right because when we plug in ( x = 0 ), ( C(0) = 5000 leq 8000 ), which is true. When ( x = 26 ), ( C(26) = 60 leq 8000 ), which is also true. But wait, if the inequality is always true, that would mean that for all ( x ), ( C(x) leq 8000 ). But that's not the case because at ( x = 6.6667 ), ( C(x) ≈ 5666.67 ), which is less than 8000, and as ( x ) increases beyond that, the cost decreases. Wait, but earlier, we saw that ( C(x) ) can be as low as 60, which is still less than 8000.Wait, but actually, the original inequality was ( C(x) leq 8000 ). Since ( C(x) ) is a downward opening parabola with a maximum at ( x ≈ 6.6667 ), the cost is always less than or equal to 5666.67, which is less than 8000. Therefore, the inequality ( C(x) leq 8000 ) is always true for all ( x ) in the domain where ( C(x) ) is defined (i.e., ( x ) from 0 to 26). Therefore, the actor can have the procedure any number of years since his last procedure, from 0 to 26 years, and the cost will always be within his 8,000 budget.But wait, let me verify this. Let's check ( x = 0 ): 5000 ≤ 8000, true.( x = 6 ): 5660 ≤ 8000, true.( x = 26 ): 60 ≤ 8000, true.And since the maximum cost is 5666.67, which is less than 8000, the inequality holds for all ( x ) in the domain. Therefore, the range of ( x ) is all non-negative integers from 0 to 26.But wait, the problem says \\"solve the inequality ( C(x) leq 8000 ) to find the range of years.\\" So, the solution is all integers ( x ) such that ( 0 leq x leq 26 ).Therefore, the range is ( x in {0, 1, 2, ..., 26} ).But let me make sure. If the quadratic inequality ( 15x^2 - 200x + 3000 geq 0 ) is always true, then ( C(x) leq 8000 ) is always true. So, the actor can wait any number of years from 0 to 26, and the cost will always be within his budget.Therefore, the answer to part 2 is all integers ( x ) from 0 to 26 inclusive.But let me double-check by plugging in a value beyond 26, say ( x = 27 ):( C(27) = 5000 + 200*27 -15*(27)^2 = 5000 + 5400 - 15*729 = 10400 - 10935 = -535 ).Which is negative, so it's invalid. Therefore, ( x ) can't be 27. So, the maximum ( x ) is 26.Therefore, the range is ( 0 leq x leq 26 ).So, summarizing:1. The number of years that minimizes the cost is 26.2. The range of years that keeps the cost within 8,000 is from 0 to 26 years.But wait, part 1 says \\"minimize the cost,\\" and according to the model, the cost is minimized at 26 years with a cost of 60. But in reality, the actor might not want to wait 26 years for a cheaper procedure. Maybe the model is intended to have a minimum, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the function.Wait, another thought: maybe the function is supposed to have a minimum, but it's written as a maximum. Let me check the function again: ( C(x) = 5000 + 200x -15x^2 ). So, it's a quadratic with a negative coefficient on ( x^2 ), which means it's a maximum, not a minimum. Therefore, the cost is maximized at the vertex, and minimized at the endpoints.But if the actor wants to minimize the cost, he should choose the endpoint with the lowest cost, which is at ( x = 26 ). So, the answer is 26 years.But let me think again: if the cost function is a maximum at ( x ≈ 6.6667 ), then the cost is highest there, and lower elsewhere. So, to minimize the cost, the actor should either have the procedure immediately (x=0) or wait until x=26. But at x=0, the cost is 5000, and at x=26, it's 60. So, 60 is much lower than 5000. Therefore, the minimum cost is at x=26.Therefore, the answers are:1. 26 years.2. All integers from 0 to 26 inclusive.But let me check the calculations again to make sure.For part 1:Vertex at x ≈ 6.6667, which is a maximum. Therefore, the cost is minimized at the endpoints. Since x=0 gives 5000, and x=26 gives 60, the minimum is at x=26.For part 2:The inequality ( C(x) leq 8000 ) is always true because the maximum cost is ~5666.67, which is less than 8000. Therefore, all x from 0 to 26 satisfy the inequality.Therefore, the final answers are:1. 26 years.2. 0 ≤ x ≤ 26.But since x is a non-negative integer, the range is x = 0,1,2,...,26.So, I think that's it."},{"question":"In triangle PQR, angle Q = 30^circ, angle R = 105^circ, and PR = 4 sqrt{2}.  Find QR.","answer":"Alright, so I have this triangle PQR. Let me try to visualize it first. They've given me two angles: angle Q is 30 degrees, and angle R is 105 degrees. Also, the length of side PR is 4 times the square root of 2. I need to find the length of side QR. Hmm, okay.First, I remember that in any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees. So, if I know two angles, I can find the third one. Let me calculate angle P. So, angle P would be 180 minus angle Q minus angle R. That would be 180 - 30 - 105. Let me do the math: 180 - 30 is 150, and 150 - 105 is 45 degrees. So, angle P is 45 degrees.Now, I need to figure out which sides correspond to which angles. In triangle PQR, side opposite angle P is QR, side opposite angle Q is PR, and side opposite angle R is PQ. Wait, let me make sure: in triangle notation, side opposite angle A is a, so in this case, side opposite angle P is QR, which is side p; side opposite angle Q is PR, which is side q; and side opposite angle R is PQ, which is side r.Wait, hold on, maybe I should clarify the notation. In triangle PQR, the vertices are P, Q, R. So, side PQ is opposite angle R, side QR is opposite angle P, and side PR is opposite angle Q. So, yeah, that's correct. So, side PR is opposite angle Q, which is 30 degrees, and its length is given as 4√2. So, side PR is 4√2, opposite 30 degrees. I need to find QR, which is opposite angle P, which is 45 degrees.So, since I have two angles and a side, I can use the Law of Sines to find the other sides. The Law of Sines says that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant. So, that is, (a/sin A) = (b/sin B) = (c/sin C).So, in this case, I can write that PR / sin Q = QR / sin P. Plugging in the known values, that would be 4√2 / sin 30° = QR / sin 45°.Let me compute sin 30° and sin 45°. Sin 30° is 0.5, and sin 45° is √2 / 2, which is approximately 0.7071, but I'll keep it as √2 / 2 for exactness.So, substituting those in, the equation becomes:4√2 / 0.5 = QR / (√2 / 2)Simplify the left side: 4√2 divided by 0.5 is the same as 4√2 multiplied by 2, which is 8√2.So, 8√2 = QR / (√2 / 2)To solve for QR, I can multiply both sides by (√2 / 2):QR = 8√2 * (√2 / 2)Let me compute that. First, √2 times √2 is 2. So, 8√2 * √2 is 8 * 2, which is 16. Then, 16 divided by 2 is 8. So, QR is 8.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Calculated angle P: 180 - 30 - 105 = 45 degrees. That seems right.2. Identified sides: PR is opposite angle Q (30°), QR is opposite angle P (45°). Correct.3. Applied Law of Sines: (PR)/sin Q = (QR)/sin P. Plugged in the values: 4√2 / 0.5 = QR / (√2 / 2). Simplified left side to 8√2. Then, QR = 8√2 * (√2 / 2). Calculated that as 8.Wait, let me verify the multiplication step:8√2 * (√2 / 2) = (8 * √2 * √2) / 2 = (8 * 2) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8. Yep, that's correct.So, QR is 8 units long.Alternatively, just to make sure, maybe I can use the Law of Cosines as another method to verify. Let's see.Law of Cosines states that c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C. But in this case, I don't know two sides, so maybe it's not as straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can compute another side and then use Law of Cosines.Wait, but since I have two angles and a side, Law of Sines is the more direct approach. So, I think my initial method is correct.Just to recap:- Calculated the third angle: 45°.- Applied Law of Sines: 4√2 / sin 30° = QR / sin 45°.- Solved for QR, got 8.I think that's solid. So, the length of QR is 8.**Final Answer**The length of QR is boxed{8}."},{"question":"A contemporary Filipino painter is planning an exhibition inspired by the nation's history and tropical beauty.

Use (pi approx 3.14).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a Filipino painter creating a mural with two pieces. The first piece is a rectangular canvas depicting historical events, and the second is a circular canvas inspired by tropical beauty. I need to find the dimensions of the rectangle and then figure out the diameter of the circle based on the perimeter of the rectangle. Let me tackle each part step by step.Starting with the first problem: the rectangular canvas. It says the length is 3 meters longer than twice its width. Let me denote the width as ( w ) meters. Then, the length would be ( 2w + 3 ) meters. Got that down. The area of the rectangle is given as 54 square meters. I remember that the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, so I can set up an equation:( text{Area} = text{length} times text{width} )( 54 = (2w + 3) times w )Expanding that, it becomes:( 54 = 2w^2 + 3w )Hmm, this is a quadratic equation. To solve for ( w ), I should rearrange it into standard quadratic form:( 2w^2 + 3w - 54 = 0 )Now, I can try to solve this quadratic equation. Let me see if it factors nicely. I need two numbers that multiply to ( 2 times (-54) = -108 ) and add up to 3. Let me think... 12 and -9? Because 12 * (-9) = -108 and 12 + (-9) = 3. Yes, that works.So, I can factor the quadratic as:( 2w^2 + 12w - 9w - 54 = 0 )Grouping the terms:( (2w^2 + 12w) + (-9w - 54) = 0 )Factor out common terms from each group:( 2w(w + 6) - 9(w + 6) = 0 )Now, factor out the common binomial:( (2w - 9)(w + 6) = 0 )Setting each factor equal to zero:1. ( 2w - 9 = 0 ) → ( 2w = 9 ) → ( w = frac{9}{2} = 4.5 ) meters2. ( w + 6 = 0 ) → ( w = -6 ) metersSince width can't be negative, we discard ( w = -6 ). So, the width is 4.5 meters. Then, the length is ( 2w + 3 = 2(4.5) + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12 ) meters.Let me double-check the area: 4.5 * 12 = 54, which matches the given area. Good.Moving on to the second problem: the circular canvas. The circumference of this circle is equal to the perimeter of the rectangular piece. First, I need to find the perimeter of the rectangle.Perimeter of a rectangle is ( 2 times (text{length} + text{width}) ). Plugging in the values:Perimeter ( P = 2(12 + 4.5) = 2(16.5) = 33 ) meters.So, the circumference of the circle is also 33 meters. The formula for circumference is ( C = pi d ), where ( d ) is the diameter. Given ( pi approx 3.14 ), we can write:( 3.14d = 33 )To solve for ( d ), divide both sides by 3.14:( d = frac{33}{3.14} )Calculating that, let me do 33 divided by 3.14. Let me approximate:3.14 goes into 33 about 10 times because 3.14 * 10 = 31.4. Subtract 31.4 from 33, we get 1.6. Bring down a zero, making it 16.0.3.14 goes into 16.0 about 5 times because 3.14 * 5 = 15.7. Subtract 15.7 from 16.0, we get 0.3. Bring down another zero, making it 3.0.3.14 goes into 3.0 about 0.95 times. So, putting it all together, we have approximately 10.5095. Rounding to two decimal places, that's about 10.51 meters.Wait, let me verify that division again. Maybe I should use a calculator approach:33 divided by 3.14:3.14 * 10 = 31.433 - 31.4 = 1.6Bring down a zero: 16.03.14 * 5 = 15.716.0 - 15.7 = 0.3Bring down another zero: 3.03.14 * 0.95 ≈ 2.983So, 0.95 gives us approximately 2.983, which is close to 3.0. So, 0.95 is about 0.95.So, total is 10 + 5 + 0.95 = 15.95? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I think I messed up the decimal places.Wait, no. Let me think again. 3.14 goes into 33 ten times with a remainder, then into 16 five times with a remainder, then into 3 approximately 0.95 times. So, the total is 10 + 5 + 0.95 = 15.95? Wait, that can't be because 3.14 * 10 is 31.4, which is less than 33. So, 10 + 5 + 0.95 is 15.95, but that would mean 3.14 * 15.95 ≈ 33? Wait, no, that's not correct because 3.14 * 10 is 31.4, and 3.14 * 15.95 is way more than 33.Wait, I think I confused myself. Let me write it as a division:33 ÷ 3.14We can write this as 3300 ÷ 314 to eliminate decimals.314 goes into 3300 how many times?314 * 10 = 3140Subtract 3140 from 3300: 160Bring down a zero: 1600314 goes into 1600 five times (5*314=1570)Subtract 1570 from 1600: 30Bring down another zero: 300314 goes into 300 zero times. Bring down another zero: 3000314 goes into 3000 nine times (9*314=2826)Subtract 2826 from 3000: 174Bring down another zero: 1740314 goes into 1740 five times (5*314=1570)Subtract 1570 from 1740: 170Bring down another zero: 1700314 goes into 1700 five times (5*314=1570)Subtract 1570 from 1700: 130Bring down another zero: 1300314 goes into 1300 four times (4*314=1256)Subtract 1256 from 1300: 44Bring down another zero: 440314 goes into 440 once (1*314=314)Subtract 314 from 440: 126Bring down another zero: 1260314 goes into 1260 four times (4*314=1256)Subtract 1256 from 1260: 4So, putting it all together, we have:10.5095... approximately.So, 10.5095 meters. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 10.51 meters.Wait, but earlier when I thought 3.14 * 10.51, let me check:3.14 * 10 = 31.43.14 * 0.5 = 1.573.14 * 0.01 = 0.0314So, 31.4 + 1.57 = 32.97, plus 0.0314 is 33.0014, which is approximately 33.0014, very close to 33. So, 10.51 meters is accurate.Therefore, the diameter ( d ) is approximately 10.51 meters.Let me recap:1. For the rectangle, width is 4.5 meters, length is 12 meters.2. Perimeter of rectangle is 33 meters, so circumference of circle is 33 meters. Using ( C = pi d ), solving for ( d ) gives approximately 10.51 meters.I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. The quadratic was solved correctly, and the circumference calculation checks out.**Final Answer**1. The dimensions of the rectangular canvas are boxed{4.5} meters (width) and boxed{12} meters (length).2. The diameter of the circular canvas is approximately boxed{10.51} meters."},{"question":"In a group of 3 male teachers and 3 female teachers, a team of 3 people is to be selected for mandatory blood donation, with the requirement that both male and female teachers must be included.

They find that the number of articles ( A(t) ) written in month ( t ) since the policy was enacted can be modeled by the quadratic equation ( A(t) = -2t^2 + 16t + 30 ).1. Determine the month ( t ) when the maximum number of articles were written, and calculate the maximum number of articles.2. The journalist also notices that the percentage of articles specifically focused on freedom of speech is given by the rational expression ( P(t) = frac{4t + 20}{t + 5} ). Simplify this expression and evaluate it for the month when the maximum number of articles were written.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a journalist studying the effect of a new government policy on the number of articles written about constitutional rights. The model given is a quadratic equation: ( A(t) = -2t^2 + 16t + 30 ). There are two parts to the problem. Let me tackle them one by one.Starting with part 1: Determine the month ( t ) when the maximum number of articles were written, and calculate the maximum number of articles.Hmm, okay. So, this is a quadratic function in terms of ( t ), and since the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola will give me the maximum point. So, the vertex will tell me the time ( t ) when the number of articles is maximized.I remember that for a quadratic function in standard form ( ax^2 + bx + c ), the vertex occurs at ( t = -frac{b}{2a} ). Let me apply that here.Given ( A(t) = -2t^2 + 16t + 30 ), so ( a = -2 ), ( b = 16 ).So, ( t = -frac{16}{2*(-2)} ). Let me compute that.First, the denominator: 2 times -2 is -4. So, ( t = -frac{16}{-4} ). Dividing 16 by 4 gives 4, and the negatives cancel out, so ( t = 4 ).So, the maximum number of articles occurs in the 4th month.Now, to find the maximum number of articles, I need to plug ( t = 4 ) back into the equation ( A(t) ).Calculating ( A(4) ):( A(4) = -2*(4)^2 + 16*4 + 30 ).First, compute ( (4)^2 = 16 ). Then, multiply by -2: -2*16 = -32.Next, compute 16*4: that's 64.So, putting it all together: -32 + 64 + 30.Let me add them step by step. -32 + 64 is 32. Then, 32 + 30 is 62.So, the maximum number of articles is 62, occurring in the 4th month.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Compute ( A(4) ):-2*(16) + 16*4 + 30.-32 + 64 + 30.Yes, that's 32 + 30, which is 62. Okay, that seems correct.Alternatively, I can use the vertex formula for the maximum value. The maximum value of a quadratic is given by ( c - frac{b^2}{4a} ). Let me try that as a check.So, ( c = 30 ), ( b = 16 ), ( a = -2 ).Compute ( frac{b^2}{4a} = frac{256}{4*(-2)} = frac{256}{-8} = -32 ).Then, ( c - frac{b^2}{4a} = 30 - (-32) = 30 + 32 = 62 ). Yep, same result. So, that confirms it.Alright, moving on to part 2: The journalist notices that the percentage of articles specifically focused on freedom of speech is given by the rational expression ( P(t) = frac{4t + 20}{t + 5} ). I need to simplify this expression and evaluate it for the month when the maximum number of articles were written, which we found to be ( t = 4 ).First, let's simplify ( P(t) ).Looking at the numerator and denominator:Numerator: 4t + 20Denominator: t + 5I notice that the numerator can be factored. Let's factor out a 4 from the numerator:4t + 20 = 4(t + 5)So, ( P(t) = frac{4(t + 5)}{t + 5} )Now, as long as ( t + 5 neq 0 ) (i.e., ( t neq -5 )), we can cancel out the ( t + 5 ) terms.So, simplifying, ( P(t) = 4 ).Wait, that's interesting. So, the percentage is a constant 4, regardless of ( t ), as long as ( t neq -5 ). But since ( t ) represents the month since the policy was enacted, ( t ) must be a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...). So, ( t = -5 ) isn't in the domain here.Therefore, the simplified expression is just 4. So, the percentage is always 4, regardless of the month.But let me double-check my simplification.Original expression: ( frac{4t + 20}{t + 5} )Factor numerator: 4(t + 5)So, ( frac{4(t + 5)}{t + 5} ). Yes, as long as ( t + 5 neq 0 ), which it isn't in our case, we can cancel them out, leaving 4.So, that simplifies nicely. So, the percentage is always 4%, regardless of the month.But just to be thorough, let me evaluate ( P(t) ) at ( t = 4 ) without simplifying first, to make sure.Compute ( P(4) = frac{4*4 + 20}{4 + 5} )Calculate numerator: 16 + 20 = 36Denominator: 9So, ( P(4) = 36 / 9 = 4 ). Yep, same result.So, whether I simplify first or plug in ( t = 4 ) first, I get 4.Therefore, the percentage is 4% in the month when the maximum number of articles were written, which is the 4th month.Wait, hold on a second. The question says \\"the percentage of articles specifically focused on freedom of speech is given by the rational expression ( P(t) = frac{4t + 20}{t + 5} ).\\" So, if I simplify it, it's 4, which is a constant. So, the percentage is always 4, regardless of ( t ). So, in the 4th month, it's 4%, same as any other month.But just to make sure, let me test another value of ( t ) to see if the percentage changes.Let's take ( t = 0 ):( P(0) = frac{0 + 20}{0 + 5} = 20 / 5 = 4 ). So, 4%.How about ( t = 1 ):( P(1) = frac{4 + 20}{1 + 5} = 24 / 6 = 4 ). Still 4%.Another one: ( t = 5 ):( P(5) = frac{20 + 20}{5 + 5} = 40 / 10 = 4 ). Yep, 4%.So, it seems that regardless of ( t ), the percentage is always 4. So, the simplification is correct.Therefore, in the month when the maximum number of articles were written, which is the 4th month, the percentage of articles focused on freedom of speech is 4%.Wait, but just to clarify, is the percentage 4% or 40%? Because sometimes in these problems, the expression might represent a percentage, but it's just a number. So, if ( P(t) = 4 ), does that mean 4% or 400%? Hmm.Looking back at the problem statement: \\"the percentage of articles specifically focused on freedom of speech is given by the rational expression ( P(t) = frac{4t + 20}{t + 5} ).\\"So, it's explicitly stated as a percentage. So, if ( P(t) = 4 ), that would be 4%.But let me check the units. If ( P(t) ) is a percentage, then 4 would mean 4%, right? Because percentages are often represented as numbers without the percent sign, but in context, it's clear.Alternatively, if ( P(t) ) were a decimal, 4 would be 400%, which doesn't make much sense in this context. So, given that it's a percentage, 4 is 4%.Therefore, the percentage is 4%.So, summarizing:1. The maximum number of articles occurs in the 4th month, with 62 articles.2. The percentage of articles focused on freedom of speech is 4%, which is constant over time, so in the 4th month, it's also 4%.I think that's all. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.For part 1, quadratic function, vertex at t=4, maximum articles 62. For part 2, simplifying the rational expression, it reduces to 4, so 4% in the 4th month. Seems solid.**Final Answer**1. The maximum number of articles was written in the boxed{4}th month, with a total of boxed{62} articles.2. The percentage of articles focused on freedom of speech in that month is boxed{4%}."},{"question":"Given that the distance between two parallel lines l_1: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 and l_2: 6x + by + c = 0 is 3, find the value of b+c.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about two parallel lines, l₁ and l₂. The equations are given as l₁: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 and l₂: 6x + by + c = 0. The distance between them is 3, and I need to find the value of b + c. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for two parallel lines, their slopes must be equal. So, maybe I can find the slope of l₁ and set it equal to the slope of l₂. That should give me some information about the coefficients in l₂'s equation.Let me rewrite both equations in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where m is the slope. For l₁: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0. Let's solve for y.Subtract 3x and 5 from both sides: 4y = -3x - 5. Then divide both sides by 4: y = (-3/4)x - 5/4. So, the slope of l₁ is -3/4.Now, let's do the same for l₂: 6x + by + c = 0. Solving for y, we get by = -6x - c. Then, y = (-6/b)x - c/b. So, the slope of l₂ is -6/b.Since the lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal. Therefore, -3/4 = -6/b. Let me solve for b.Multiply both sides by b: (-3/4)b = -6. Then, multiply both sides by -1: (3/4)b = 6. Now, multiply both sides by 4: 3b = 24. Then, divide both sides by 3: b = 8. Okay, so b is 8. Got that.Now, I need to find c. The distance between the two lines is given as 3. I remember the formula for the distance between two parallel lines Ax + By + C = 0 and Ax + By + D = 0 is |C - D| / sqrt(A² + B²). But wait, in this case, the lines aren't in the same form yet. Let me check.l₁ is 3x + 4y + 5 = 0, and l₂ is 6x + 8y + c = 0 (since b = 8). Hmm, I notice that l₂ is actually a multiple of l₁. Let me see: If I multiply l₁ by 2, I get 6x + 8y + 10 = 0. So, l₂ is 6x + 8y + c = 0, which is similar but with a different constant term.So, in terms of the distance formula, l₁ can be considered as 6x + 8y + 10 = 0, and l₂ is 6x + 8y + c = 0. Therefore, the distance between them is |c - 10| / sqrt(6² + 8²). Let me compute that.First, sqrt(6² + 8²) is sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10. So, the distance is |c - 10| / 10. And we know this distance is 3. So, |c - 10| / 10 = 3. Multiply both sides by 10: |c - 10| = 30.This gives two possibilities: c - 10 = 30 or c - 10 = -30. So, solving for c, we get c = 40 or c = -20. Hmm, so c can be either 40 or -20. Therefore, there are two possible values for c.But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because l₂ is 6x + 8y + c = 0, and l₁ is 3x + 4y + 5 = 0. When I multiplied l₁ by 2, I got 6x + 8y + 10 = 0. So, l₂ is 6x + 8y + c = 0, which is just a different constant term. So, the distance formula should hold.But let me verify the distance formula again. The distance between two parallel lines Ax + By + C = 0 and Ax + By + D = 0 is |C - D| / sqrt(A² + B²). So, in this case, the two lines are 6x + 8y + 10 = 0 and 6x + 8y + c = 0. So, C is 10 and D is c. So, the distance is |10 - c| / sqrt(6² + 8²) = |10 - c| / 10. Wait, earlier I wrote |c - 10|, which is the same as |10 - c|, so that's correct.So, |10 - c| / 10 = 3, which gives |10 - c| = 30. So, 10 - c = 30 or 10 - c = -30. Therefore, solving for c:Case 1: 10 - c = 30 => -c = 20 => c = -20.Case 2: 10 - c = -30 => -c = -40 => c = 40.So, c can be either -20 or 40. Therefore, there are two possible values for c.But wait, let me think about whether both solutions are valid. Because sometimes when you have parallel lines, depending on the direction, the distance could be positive or negative, but since distance is always positive, both solutions are valid. So, both c = -20 and c = 40 are acceptable.Therefore, the possible values for c are -20 and 40. So, since b is 8, then b + c can be either 8 + (-20) = -12 or 8 + 40 = 48.Wait, but the problem says \\"the distance between two parallel lines is 3.\\" It doesn't specify which side, so both are possible. So, does that mean there are two possible answers? Hmm, but the problem asks for \\"the value of b + c.\\" It might be expecting both possibilities, but let me check the problem again.Wait, the problem is given as l₁: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 and l₂: 6x + by + c = 0. So, when I multiplied l₁ by 2, I got 6x + 8y + 10 = 0, so l₂ is 6x + 8y + c = 0. So, if c is 40, then l₂ is 6x + 8y + 40 = 0, which is further away from l₁, and if c is -20, it's closer? Wait, actually, the distance is 3 regardless, so both are 3 units apart from l₁, but on opposite sides.So, both are correct. Therefore, b + c can be either 8 + (-20) = -12 or 8 + 40 = 48.But wait, let me think again. Is there a way to determine which one is correct? Because depending on the sign of c, the line could be on one side or the other. But since the problem doesn't specify, both are valid. So, perhaps both are acceptable, but the problem might be expecting both answers? Or maybe only one.Wait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in the distance formula.Wait, the formula is |C - D| / sqrt(A² + B²). So, in this case, l₁ is 6x + 8y + 10 = 0, and l₂ is 6x + 8y + c = 0. So, C is 10, D is c. So, |10 - c| / 10 = 3. So, |10 - c| = 30, leading to c = -20 or 40. So, that seems correct.Alternatively, if I use the original equations, l₁: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 and l₂: 6x + 8y + c = 0. Wait, actually, the distance formula can also be applied directly to these two lines, but I need to make sure they are in the same coefficients for x and y.Wait, l₁ is 3x + 4y + 5 = 0, and l₂ is 6x + 8y + c = 0. So, l₂ is just 2*(3x + 4y) + c = 0. So, if I write l₂ as 3x + 4y + (c/2) = 0, then I can apply the distance formula between l₁: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 and l₂: 3x + 4y + (c/2) = 0.So, the distance would be |5 - (c/2)| / sqrt(3² + 4²) = |5 - c/2| / 5. And this distance is given as 3. So, |5 - c/2| / 5 = 3. Multiply both sides by 5: |5 - c/2| = 15.So, 5 - c/2 = 15 or 5 - c/2 = -15.Case 1: 5 - c/2 = 15 => -c/2 = 10 => c = -20.Case 2: 5 - c/2 = -15 => -c/2 = -20 => c = 40.Same result as before. So, c is either -20 or 40. So, b is 8, so b + c is either 8 + (-20) = -12 or 8 + 40 = 48.Therefore, the possible values for b + c are -12 and 48. But the problem asks for \\"the value of b + c.\\" Hmm, it's a bit ambiguous. Maybe both are acceptable? Or perhaps I need to consider something else.Wait, let me think about the direction of the normal vector. The distance formula gives the minimal distance between the two lines, regardless of direction. So, both lines are 3 units apart from l₁, but on opposite sides. So, both are correct.Therefore, since both are correct, but the problem is asking for \\"the value of b + c,\\" perhaps both are acceptable, but maybe I need to write both? Or maybe the problem expects both solutions.But in the original problem statement, it's just asking for \\"the value of b + c.\\" So, maybe both are acceptable, but perhaps I should write both answers.Wait, but in the problem statement, l₂ is given as 6x + by + c = 0. So, when I found b = 8, that's fixed. So, c can be either -20 or 40. So, b + c is either -12 or 48.Wait, but let me think again. If I plug c = -20 into l₂, I get 6x + 8y - 20 = 0. If I plug c = 40, I get 6x + 8y + 40 = 0. Both are parallel to l₁, and both are 3 units away from l₁. So, both are correct.Therefore, the possible values for b + c are -12 and 48. So, unless the problem specifies which one, both are correct. But since the problem asks for \\"the value,\\" maybe it's expecting both? Or perhaps I made a mistake in assuming both are correct.Wait, let me think about the formula again. The distance between two parallel lines is always positive, so the absolute value is necessary. So, both solutions are correct because the lines can be on either side of l₁.Therefore, I think both are acceptable. So, the possible values for b + c are -12 and 48.But let me check if the problem expects a single answer. It says \\"the distance between two parallel lines... is 3, find the value of b + c.\\" So, maybe both are acceptable, but perhaps I need to write both. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the direction of the normal vector.Wait, another thought: The distance formula is |C - D| / sqrt(A² + B²). So, if I take l₁ as 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 and l₂ as 6x + 8y + c = 0, which is 2*(3x + 4y) + c = 0. So, the normal vector of l₁ is (3, 4), and the normal vector of l₂ is (6, 8), which is just 2*(3, 4). So, they are in the same direction. Therefore, the distance is |(5) - (c/2)| / 5 = 3.Wait, so that's another way to get the same result. So, |5 - c/2| = 15, leading to c = -20 or 40. So, same result.Therefore, I think both are correct, so b + c can be either -12 or 48.Wait, but let me think again. If I plug c = -20 into l₂, I get 6x + 8y - 20 = 0, which simplifies to 3x + 4y - 10 = 0. The distance from l₁: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 is |5 - (-10)| / 5 = |15| / 5 = 3. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, the distance formula is |C - D| / sqrt(A² + B²). So, for l₁: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 and l₂: 3x + 4y -10 = 0, the distance is |5 - (-10)| / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3. So, that's correct.Similarly, if c = 40, then l₂ is 6x + 8y + 40 = 0, which simplifies to 3x + 4y + 20 = 0. The distance from l₁: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 is |5 - 20| / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3. So, that's also correct.Therefore, both c = -20 and c = 40 are correct, leading to b + c being -12 or 48. So, since the problem doesn't specify which one, I think both are acceptable. But the problem is asking for \\"the value of b + c,\\" which is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it expects both answers? Or perhaps I need to write both.Wait, but in the problem statement, l₂ is given as 6x + by + c = 0. So, if I write l₂ as 6x + 8y + c = 0, then c can be -20 or 40. So, b is 8, so b + c is either 8 + (-20) = -12 or 8 + 40 = 48.Therefore, the possible values for b + c are -12 and 48. So, unless the problem specifies further, both are correct. So, maybe I should write both.But let me check the problem again: \\"Given that the distance between two parallel lines l₁: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 and l₂: 6x + by + c = 0 is 3, find the value of b + c.\\"It says \\"the value,\\" but since there are two possible values, I think both are acceptable. So, maybe I need to write both.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only one answer, so maybe I made a mistake in assuming both are correct. Let me think again.Wait, when I multiplied l₁ by 2, I got 6x + 8y + 10 = 0. So, l₂ is 6x + 8y + c = 0. So, the distance between them is |c - 10| / 10 = 3. So, |c - 10| = 30, leading to c = 40 or c = -20.But if I take l₂ as 6x + 8y + c = 0, and l₁ as 3x + 4y + 5 = 0, then the distance is |5 - c/2| / 5 = 3, leading to |5 - c/2| = 15, so c = -20 or 40.So, same result. So, both are correct.Therefore, I think both are acceptable, so b + c is either -12 or 48.But the problem says \\"find the value of b + c.\\" So, maybe both are acceptable, but perhaps I need to write both. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects both answers.Wait, but in the problem statement, it's just asking for \\"the value,\\" so maybe it's expecting both. So, I think the answer is either -12 or 48.But let me think again. If I plug c = -20 into l₂, I get 6x + 8y - 20 = 0, which is 3x + 4y -10 = 0. The distance from l₁: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 is |5 - (-10)| / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3, which is correct.Similarly, if c = 40, l₂ is 6x + 8y + 40 = 0, which is 3x + 4y + 20 = 0. The distance from l₁ is |5 - 20| / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3, which is also correct.Therefore, both are correct, so b + c can be either -12 or 48.Wait, but in the problem statement, l₂ is given as 6x + by + c = 0. So, if I write l₂ as 6x + 8y + c = 0, then c can be -20 or 40. So, b is 8, so b + c is either 8 + (-20) = -12 or 8 + 40 = 48.Therefore, the possible values for b + c are -12 and 48. So, unless the problem specifies further, both are correct. So, I think both are acceptable.But the problem is asking for \\"the value of b + c,\\" which is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it expects both answers? Or perhaps I need to write both.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming both are correct. Let me think again.Wait, another approach: Let's use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The formula is |C₁ - C₂| / sqrt(A² + B²), where the lines are Ax + By + C₁ = 0 and Ax + By + C₂ = 0.In this case, l₁ is 3x + 4y + 5 = 0, and l₂ is 6x + 8y + c = 0. But to apply the formula, the coefficients of x and y must be the same. So, I can write l₂ as 3x + 4y + (c/2) = 0 by dividing both sides by 2.So, now, l₁ is 3x + 4y + 5 = 0, and l₂ is 3x + 4y + (c/2) = 0. Therefore, the distance is |5 - (c/2)| / sqrt(3² + 4²) = |5 - c/2| / 5. This distance is given as 3.So, |5 - c/2| / 5 = 3 => |5 - c/2| = 15. Therefore, 5 - c/2 = 15 or 5 - c/2 = -15.Case 1: 5 - c/2 = 15 => -c/2 = 10 => c = -20.Case 2: 5 - c/2 = -15 => -c/2 = -20 => c = 40.So, same result as before. Therefore, c can be -20 or 40, leading to b + c being -12 or 48.Therefore, I think both are correct. So, the possible values for b + c are -12 and 48.But the problem is asking for \\"the value of b + c,\\" which is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it expects both answers? Or perhaps the problem is designed such that both are acceptable.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming both are correct. Let me think again.Wait, another thought: When I write l₂ as 6x + 8y + c = 0, it's equivalent to 3x + 4y + c/2 = 0. So, the distance from l₁: 3x + 4y + 5 = 0 is |5 - c/2| / 5 = 3. So, |5 - c/2| = 15, leading to c = -20 or 40.Therefore, both are correct, so b + c is either -12 or 48.Therefore, I think both are acceptable, so the possible values for b + c are -12 and 48.But the problem is asking for \\"the value of b + c,\\" so maybe both are acceptable. So, perhaps I should write both.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects only one answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in assuming both are correct. Let me think again.Wait, no, I think both are correct because the lines can be on either side of l₁, so both are 3 units away but in opposite directions. Therefore, both are correct.Therefore, the possible values for b + c are -12 and 48.But since the problem is asking for \\"the value,\\" maybe I should write both. So, I think the answer is either -12 or 48.Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given as l₂: 6x + by + c = 0. So, when I found b = 8, that's fixed. So, c can be either -20 or 40, leading to b + c being -12 or 48.Therefore, the possible values for b + c are -12 and 48.So, I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( b + c ) is boxed{-12} or boxed{48}.Wait, but in the problem statement, it's asking for \\"the value of b + c.\\" So, maybe it's expecting both answers.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down the equation:2 sin(α - 15°) - 1 = 0I need to solve for α, right? So, let me isolate the sine term. I'll add 1 to both sides:2 sin(α - 15°) = 1Now, divide both sides by 2:sin(α - 15°) = 1/2Okay, so sin of some angle is 1/2. I remember that sin(30°) is 1/2. So, does that mean α - 15° is 30°? Well, sine is positive in the first and second quadrants, but since α is an acute angle, which is between 0° and 90°, then α - 15° must also be in a range where sine is positive. Let me think about that.If α is acute, then α is between 0° and 90°, so α - 15° is between -15° and 75°. But sine is positive in the first and second quadrants, which is 0° to 180°. So, in this case, α - 15° can be in the first or second quadrant. But since α is acute, α - 15° can't be more than 75°, which is still in the first quadrant. So, the angle α - 15° must be 30°, right? Because that's the principal solution in the first quadrant.So, α - 15° = 30°, which means α = 30° + 15° = 45°. Wait, is that right? Let me check.If α is 45°, then α - 15° is 30°, and sin(30°) is indeed 1/2. So, plugging back into the original equation:2 sin(45° - 15°) - 1 = 2 sin(30°) - 1 = 2*(1/2) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0. Yep, that works.So, α is 45°, and tan α is tan(45°). I remember that tan(45°) is 1. So, is the answer 1?Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. So, starting from the equation:2 sin(α - 15°) - 1 = 0I added 1 to both sides:2 sin(α - 15°) = 1Divided by 2:sin(α - 15°) = 1/2Then, since sin(30°) = 1/2, and considering the range of α - 15°, which is between -15° and 75°, the only solution is 30°, so α is 45°, and tan(45°) is 1.Hmm, seems straightforward. But wait, could there be another angle in that range where sin is 1/2? Let's think. The sine function is 1/2 at 30° and 150°, right? But 150° is way beyond the upper limit of α - 15°, which is 75°, so 150° is too big. So, no, only 30° is the solution in that interval.Therefore, α is 45°, so tan α is 1. So, yeah, I think that's correct.But just to double-check, let me compute tan(45°). Yes, tan(45°) is 1 because opposite over adjacent in a 45-45-90 triangle is 1. So, that's consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using some trigonometric identities. Let me try that.Starting with the equation:2 sin(α - 15°) - 1 = 0So, sin(α - 15°) = 1/2Let me denote θ = α - 15°, so sin θ = 1/2. Then θ = 30° + 360°k or θ = 150° + 360°k, where k is any integer.But since α is acute, θ = α - 15° must be between -15° and 75°, as I thought earlier. So, the only possible θ in this interval is 30°, so α = 45°, as before.Therefore, tan α = tan(45°) = 1.Wait, another thought: Maybe I can use the sine of a difference identity to expand sin(α - 15°) and solve for α. Let me try that.Recall that sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B.So, sin(α - 15°) = sin α cos 15° - cos α sin 15°Given that sin(α - 15°) = 1/2, so:sin α cos 15° - cos α sin 15° = 1/2Let me write that equation:sin α cos 15° - cos α sin 15° = 1/2Hmm, so I have an equation involving sin α and cos α. Maybe I can write this as a linear combination of sin α and cos α, and then express it as a single sine or cosine function.Alternatively, I can divide both sides by cos α to get tan α, but let me see.Let me denote t = tan α. Then, sin α = t / sqrt(1 + t²) and cos α = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²). Maybe substituting these into the equation would help.So, substituting:(t / sqrt(1 + t²)) * cos 15° - (1 / sqrt(1 + t²)) * sin 15° = 1/2Factor out 1 / sqrt(1 + t²):[ t cos 15° - sin 15° ] / sqrt(1 + t²) = 1/2Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + t²):t cos 15° - sin 15° = (1/2) sqrt(1 + t²)Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me try that.First, let me write:t cos 15° - sin 15° = (1/2) sqrt(1 + t²)Square both sides:(t cos 15° - sin 15°)^2 = (1/4)(1 + t²)Expand the left side:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° = (1/4) + (1/4) t²Bring all terms to the left side:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° - 1/4 - (1/4) t² = 0Combine like terms:t² (cos² 15° - 1/4) - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + (sin² 15° - 1/4) = 0Hmm, this is a quadratic in t. Let me compute the coefficients.First, cos² 15° - 1/4. Let me compute cos² 15°. I know that cos 15° is sqrt(6) + sqrt(2) over 4, so cos² 15° is (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))² / 16.Wait, that might be too complicated. Alternatively, I can use the identity cos² θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2.So, cos² 15° = (1 + cos 30°)/2 = (1 + sqrt(3)/2)/2 = (2 + sqrt(3))/4.Similarly, sin² 15° = (1 - cos 30°)/2 = (1 - sqrt(3)/2)/2 = (2 - sqrt(3))/4.So, cos² 15° - 1/4 = (2 + sqrt(3))/4 - 1/4 = (1 + sqrt(3))/4.Similarly, sin² 15° - 1/4 = (2 - sqrt(3))/4 - 1/4 = (1 - sqrt(3))/4.Also, 2 cos 15° sin 15° is sin 30°, because sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ. So, 2 cos 15° sin 15° = sin 30° = 1/2.So, putting it all together:Coefficient of t²: (1 + sqrt(3))/4Coefficient of t: -2 * (1/2) = -1Constant term: (1 - sqrt(3))/4So, the quadratic equation becomes:[(1 + sqrt(3))/4] t² - t + [(1 - sqrt(3))/4] = 0Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0So, now we have:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0This is a quadratic in t. Let me write it as:A t² + B t + C = 0Where A = 1 + sqrt(3), B = -4, and C = 1 - sqrt(3)Let me compute the discriminant D = B² - 4AC.So, D = (-4)^2 - 4*(1 + sqrt(3))*(1 - sqrt(3)) = 16 - 4*(1 - 3) = 16 - 4*(-2) = 16 + 8 = 24So, discriminant is 24. Therefore, solutions are:t = [4 ± sqrt(24)] / [2*(1 + sqrt(3))]Simplify sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6), so:t = [4 ± 2 sqrt(6)] / [2*(1 + sqrt(3))] = [2 ± sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3))So, t = [2 + sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3)) or [2 - sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3))Hmm, okay. Let me rationalize the denominators.First, for t = [2 + sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3)):Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(3)):Numerator: (2 + sqrt(6))(1 - sqrt(3)) = 2*(1) + 2*(-sqrt(3)) + sqrt(6)*1 + sqrt(6)*(-sqrt(3))= 2 - 2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(6) - sqrt(18)Simplify sqrt(18) = 3 sqrt(2):= 2 - 2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(6) - 3 sqrt(2)Denominator: (1 + sqrt(3))(1 - sqrt(3)) = 1 - 3 = -2So, t = [2 - 2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(6) - 3 sqrt(2)] / (-2) = (-2 + 2 sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) + 3 sqrt(2)) / 2Hmm, that seems complicated. Let me compute it numerically to see if it makes sense.Compute numerator:2 - 2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(6) - 3 sqrt(2) ≈ 2 - 2*1.732 + 2.449 - 3*1.414 ≈ 2 - 3.464 + 2.449 - 4.242 ≈ (2 + 2.449) - (3.464 + 4.242) ≈ 4.449 - 7.706 ≈ -3.257Divide by -2: (-3.257)/(-2) ≈ 1.6285Similarly, for the other solution:t = [2 - sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3))Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(3)):Numerator: (2 - sqrt(6))(1 - sqrt(3)) = 2*1 + 2*(-sqrt(3)) - sqrt(6)*1 + sqrt(6)*sqrt(3)= 2 - 2 sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) + sqrt(18)Simplify sqrt(18) = 3 sqrt(2):= 2 - 2 sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) + 3 sqrt(2)Denominator: same as before, -2So, t = [2 - 2 sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) + 3 sqrt(2)] / (-2) = (-2 + 2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(6) - 3 sqrt(2)) / 2Compute numerator numerically:2 - 2 sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) + 3 sqrt(2) ≈ 2 - 3.464 - 2.449 + 4.242 ≈ (2 + 4.242) - (3.464 + 2.449) ≈ 6.242 - 5.913 ≈ 0.329Divide by -2: 0.329 / (-2) ≈ -0.1645So, the two solutions are approximately 1.6285 and -0.1645.But since α is an acute angle, tan α must be positive, so we discard the negative solution. So, tan α ≈ 1.6285.Wait, but earlier, I thought tan α was 1. Hmm, that's conflicting. What's going on here?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution method. Let me check.Wait, when I squared both sides, I might have introduced an extraneous solution. So, I need to verify which of the solutions actually satisfy the original equation.So, let me compute sin(α - 15°) for both t ≈ 1.6285 and t ≈ -0.1645.First, for t ≈ 1.6285, which is tan α ≈ 1.6285, so α ≈ arctan(1.6285). Let me compute that.arctan(1.6285) is approximately, since tan(58°) ≈ 1.600, tan(59°) ≈ 1.664, so 1.6285 is between 58° and 59°, say approximately 58.5°. So, α ≈ 58.5°, then α - 15° ≈ 43.5°, and sin(43.5°) ≈ 0.688. But in the original equation, sin(α - 15°) = 1/2 ≈ 0.5, so 0.688 is not equal to 0.5. So, this solution doesn't satisfy the original equation.Wait, that's a problem. So, even though we squared and got this solution, it doesn't satisfy the original equation. Therefore, it's extraneous.Now, let's check the other solution, t ≈ -0.1645. So, tan α ≈ -0.1645. But α is an acute angle, so tan α must be positive. So, this solution is invalid because it's negative. So, both solutions are invalid? That can't be.Wait, that suggests that my substitution method might have gone wrong somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I made a computational error in expanding or simplifying.Wait, let me go back. Maybe I messed up the expansion when I squared both sides.Wait, let me recap:Starting from:sin(α - 15°) = 1/2I used the identity sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B, which is correct.Then, I set t = tan α, so sin α = t / sqrt(1 + t²) and cos α = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²). That's correct.Substituted into the equation:(t / sqrt(1 + t²)) * cos 15° - (1 / sqrt(1 + t²)) * sin 15° = 1/2Factored out 1 / sqrt(1 + t²):[ t cos 15° - sin 15° ] / sqrt(1 + t²) = 1/2Then, multiplied both sides by sqrt(1 + t²):t cos 15° - sin 15° = (1/2) sqrt(1 + t²)Then, squared both sides:(t cos 15° - sin 15°)^2 = (1/4)(1 + t²)Expanded left side:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° = (1/4) + (1/4) t²Then, moved all terms to left:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° - 1/4 - (1/4) t² = 0Then, combined like terms:t² (cos² 15° - 1/4) - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + (sin² 15° - 1/4) = 0Then, computed cos² 15° - 1/4 as (1 + sqrt(3))/4 and sin² 15° - 1/4 as (1 - sqrt(3))/4, which I think is correct.Then, 2 cos 15° sin 15° = sin 30° = 1/2, so the coefficient of t is -1.So, quadratic equation is:(1 + sqrt(3))/4 t² - t + (1 - sqrt(3))/4 = 0Multiply by 4:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0Then, discriminant D = 16 - 4*(1 + sqrt(3))(1 - sqrt(3)) = 16 - 4*(1 - 3) = 16 - (-8) = 24. So, sqrt(D) = 2 sqrt(6)Thus, solutions:t = [4 ± 2 sqrt(6)] / [2*(1 + sqrt(3))] = [2 ± sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3))Then, rationalizing:First solution: [2 + sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3)) * (1 - sqrt(3))/(1 - sqrt(3)) = [2(1 - sqrt(3)) + sqrt(6)(1 - sqrt(3))]/(-2)Wait, let me recompute that.Wait, numerator: (2 + sqrt(6))(1 - sqrt(3)) = 2*1 + 2*(-sqrt(3)) + sqrt(6)*1 + sqrt(6)*(-sqrt(3)) = 2 - 2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(6) - sqrt(18)sqrt(18) is 3 sqrt(2), so:2 - 2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(6) - 3 sqrt(2)Denominator: (1 + sqrt(3))(1 - sqrt(3)) = 1 - 3 = -2So, t = [2 - 2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(6) - 3 sqrt(2)] / (-2) = (-2 + 2 sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) + 3 sqrt(2)) / 2Similarly, for the other solution:[2 - sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3)) * (1 - sqrt(3))/(1 - sqrt(3)) = [2(1 - sqrt(3)) - sqrt(6)(1 - sqrt(3))]/(-2)Compute numerator:2*1 + 2*(-sqrt(3)) - sqrt(6)*1 + sqrt(6)*sqrt(3) = 2 - 2 sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) + sqrt(18)sqrt(18) = 3 sqrt(2), so:2 - 2 sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) + 3 sqrt(2)Denominator: -2So, t = [2 - 2 sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) + 3 sqrt(2)] / (-2) = (-2 + 2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(6) - 3 sqrt(2)) / 2So, the two solutions are:t = [ -2 + 2 sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) + 3 sqrt(2) ] / 2 ≈ [ -2 + 3.464 - 2.449 + 4.242 ] / 2 ≈ [ (-2 - 2.449) + (3.464 + 4.242) ] / 2 ≈ [ -4.449 + 7.706 ] / 2 ≈ 3.257 / 2 ≈ 1.6285And the other solution:t = [ -2 + 2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(6) - 3 sqrt(2) ] / 2 ≈ [ -2 + 3.464 + 2.449 - 4.242 ] / 2 ≈ [ (-2 - 4.242) + (3.464 + 2.449) ] / 2 ≈ [ -6.242 + 5.913 ] / 2 ≈ (-0.329)/2 ≈ -0.1645So, same as before. So, the two solutions are approximately 1.6285 and -0.1645. But as we saw earlier, plugging t ≈ 1.6285 into the original equation doesn't satisfy it because sin(α - 15°) ≈ 0.688 ≠ 0.5.Wait, so why is that? Did I make a mistake in the substitution?Wait, let me think. When I squared both sides, I might have introduced an extraneous solution, but in this case, both solutions are extraneous? That can't be.Wait, but earlier, when I solved it directly, I got α = 45°, which gives tan α = 1. So, why isn't that showing up in the substitution method?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution approach.Wait, let me try plugging t = 1 into the equation:sin(α - 15°) = 1/2If tan α = 1, then α = 45°, so α - 15° = 30°, sin(30°) = 1/2. So, that works.But in the substitution method, I didn't get t = 1 as a solution. So, why?Wait, let me check my substitution again.Wait, when I set t = tan α, then sin α = t / sqrt(1 + t²), cos α = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²). That's correct.Then, substituting into sin(α - 15°):sin α cos 15° - cos α sin 15° = (t / sqrt(1 + t²)) cos 15° - (1 / sqrt(1 + t²)) sin 15° = [ t cos 15° - sin 15° ] / sqrt(1 + t²) = 1/2So, that's correct.Then, multiplying both sides by sqrt(1 + t²):t cos 15° - sin 15° = (1/2) sqrt(1 + t²)Then, squaring both sides:(t cos 15° - sin 15°)^2 = (1/4)(1 + t²)Which expands to:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° = 1/4 + (1/4) t²Bringing all terms to left:t² (cos² 15° - 1/4) - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + (sin² 15° - 1/4) = 0Which is correct.Then, I computed cos² 15° - 1/4 as (1 + sqrt(3))/4 and sin² 15° - 1/4 as (1 - sqrt(3))/4, which seems correct.Then, 2 cos 15° sin 15° = sin 30° = 1/2, so the coefficient of t is -1.So, quadratic equation is:(1 + sqrt(3))/4 t² - t + (1 - sqrt(3))/4 = 0Multiply by 4:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0So, discriminant D = 16 - 4*(1 + sqrt(3))(1 - sqrt(3)) = 16 - 4*(1 - 3) = 16 - (-8) = 24So, sqrt(D) = 2 sqrt(6)Thus, solutions:t = [4 ± 2 sqrt(6)] / [2*(1 + sqrt(3))] = [2 ± sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3))Which is correct.So, when I rationalize, I get two solutions, approximately 1.6285 and -0.1645, but neither of them is 1.Wait, so why is that? Did I make a mistake in the substitution?Wait, perhaps I need to check if t = 1 is a solution.Let me plug t = 1 into the quadratic equation:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0So, plugging t = 1:(1 + sqrt(3)) * 1 - 4 * 1 + (1 - sqrt(3)) = (1 + sqrt(3) - 4 + 1 - sqrt(3)) = (1 + 1 - 4) + (sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)) = (-2) + 0 = -2 ≠ 0So, t = 1 is not a solution. Hmm, that's strange because earlier, when I solved directly, I got α = 45°, which gives t = 1, which should satisfy the equation.Wait, so what's going on here? Is there a mistake in the substitution method?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion when squaring both sides. Let me double-check.Original equation after substitution:[ t cos 15° - sin 15° ] / sqrt(1 + t²) = 1/2Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + t²):t cos 15° - sin 15° = (1/2) sqrt(1 + t²)Square both sides:(t cos 15° - sin 15°)^2 = (1/4)(1 + t²)Which is correct.Expanding left side:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° = (1/4) + (1/4) t²Bring all terms to left:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° - 1/4 - (1/4) t² = 0Which is correct.Then, factor:t² (cos² 15° - 1/4) - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + (sin² 15° - 1/4) = 0Which is correct.Then, compute coefficients:cos² 15° - 1/4 = (2 + sqrt(3))/4 - 1/4 = (1 + sqrt(3))/4Similarly, sin² 15° - 1/4 = (2 - sqrt(3))/4 - 1/4 = (1 - sqrt(3))/4And 2 cos 15° sin 15° = sin 30° = 1/2, so coefficient of t is -1.So, quadratic equation is:(1 + sqrt(3))/4 t² - t + (1 - sqrt(3))/4 = 0Multiply by 4:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0So, discriminant D = 16 - 4*(1 + sqrt(3))(1 - sqrt(3)) = 16 - 4*(1 - 3) = 16 - (-8) = 24So, sqrt(D) = 2 sqrt(6)Thus, solutions:t = [4 ± 2 sqrt(6)] / [2*(1 + sqrt(3))] = [2 ± sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3))Which is correct.So, why isn't t = 1 a solution? Because when I plug t = 1 into the quadratic equation, it doesn't satisfy it.Wait, but when I solved directly, I got α = 45°, which gives t = 1, which does satisfy the original equation.So, perhaps the substitution method is missing something. Maybe because when I squared both sides, I introduced an extraneous solution, but in this case, the solution t = 1 is not even appearing.Wait, maybe I need to consider that when I squared both sides, I might have lost some information.Wait, let me think. The original equation is:sin(α - 15°) = 1/2Which has solution α - 15° = 30° + 360°k or 150° + 360°kBut since α is acute, α - 15° must be between -15° and 75°, so only 30° is valid, so α = 45°, which is acute.So, that's the only solution.Therefore, tan α = 1.But in the substitution method, I didn't get t = 1 as a solution. So, perhaps the substitution method is flawed because when I squared both sides, I introduced solutions that don't satisfy the original equation, but in this case, the correct solution isn't even showing up.Wait, that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.Wait, let me try plugging t = 1 into the equation after substitution:[ t cos 15° - sin 15° ] / sqrt(1 + t²) = 1/2So, plugging t = 1:[ cos 15° - sin 15° ] / sqrt(2) = ?Compute numerator: cos 15° - sin 15° ≈ 0.9659 - 0.2588 ≈ 0.7071Denominator: sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142So, 0.7071 / 1.4142 ≈ 0.5, which is 1/2. So, that works.So, t = 1 is a solution. But when I solved the quadratic equation, I didn't get t = 1 as a solution. That's confusing.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation.Wait, let me plug t = 1 into the quadratic equation:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0So, (1 + sqrt(3)) * 1 - 4 * 1 + (1 - sqrt(3)) = (1 + sqrt(3) - 4 + 1 - sqrt(3)) = (-2) + 0 = -2 ≠ 0So, t = 1 is not a solution to the quadratic equation, but it is a solution to the original equation.Therefore, there must be a mistake in the substitution method.Wait, perhaps when I squared both sides, I introduced an extraneous solution, but also lost the correct solution.Wait, that seems contradictory. Squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, but it shouldn't lose solutions.Wait, let me check the steps again.Starting from:sin(α - 15°) = 1/2Expressed as:sin α cos 15° - cos α sin 15° = 1/2Then, expressed in terms of t = tan α:(t / sqrt(1 + t²)) cos 15° - (1 / sqrt(1 + t²)) sin 15° = 1/2Which is:[ t cos 15° - sin 15° ] / sqrt(1 + t²) = 1/2Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + t²):t cos 15° - sin 15° = (1/2) sqrt(1 + t²)Square both sides:(t cos 15° - sin 15°)^2 = (1/4)(1 + t²)Which is correct.But when I plug t = 1 into the left side:( cos 15° - sin 15° )^2 ≈ (0.9659 - 0.2588)^2 ≈ (0.7071)^2 ≈ 0.5Right side: (1/4)(1 + 1) = (1/4)(2) = 0.5So, 0.5 = 0.5, which is correct.But when I plug t = 1 into the quadratic equation, it doesn't satisfy it. So, why?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion when I moved all terms to the left.Wait, let me re-express the equation after squaring:(t cos 15° - sin 15°)^2 = (1/4)(1 + t²)Which is:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° = (1/4) + (1/4) t²Now, moving all terms to the left:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° - 1/4 - (1/4) t² = 0Which is correct.Then, factor:t² (cos² 15° - 1/4) - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + (sin² 15° - 1/4) = 0Which is correct.Then, compute coefficients:cos² 15° - 1/4 = (2 + sqrt(3))/4 - 1/4 = (1 + sqrt(3))/4sin² 15° - 1/4 = (2 - sqrt(3))/4 - 1/4 = (1 - sqrt(3))/42 cos 15° sin 15° = sin 30° = 1/2, so the coefficient of t is -1.So, quadratic equation is:(1 + sqrt(3))/4 t² - t + (1 - sqrt(3))/4 = 0Multiply by 4:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0So, discriminant D = 16 - 4*(1 + sqrt(3))(1 - sqrt(3)) = 16 - 4*(1 - 3) = 16 - (-8) = 24So, sqrt(D) = 2 sqrt(6)Thus, solutions:t = [4 ± 2 sqrt(6)] / [2*(1 + sqrt(3))] = [2 ± sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3))So, t = [2 + sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3)) ≈ 1.6285t = [2 - sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3)) ≈ -0.1645But t = 1 is not a solution. So, why is that?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra when moving terms. Let me check.Wait, when I moved all terms to the left, I had:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° - 1/4 - (1/4) t² = 0Which is:t² (cos² 15° - 1/4) - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + (sin² 15° - 1/4) = 0But wait, is that correct?Wait, the term is sin² 15° - 1/4, which is correct.But when I plug t = 1 into this equation, let's see:t² (cos² 15° - 1/4) - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + (sin² 15° - 1/4) = 0So, plugging t = 1:(1)(cos² 15° - 1/4) - 2(1) cos 15° sin 15° + (sin² 15° - 1/4) = ?Compute each term:cos² 15° - 1/4 ≈ (0.9659)^2 - 0.25 ≈ 0.933 - 0.25 ≈ 0.683-2 cos 15° sin 15° ≈ -2*(0.9659)*(0.2588) ≈ -2*0.25 ≈ -0.5sin² 15° - 1/4 ≈ (0.2588)^2 - 0.25 ≈ 0.06699 - 0.25 ≈ -0.183So, total ≈ 0.683 - 0.5 - 0.183 ≈ 0.683 - 0.683 ≈ 0So, it does equal zero. So, t = 1 is a solution. But when I solved the quadratic equation, I didn't get t = 1.Wait, that suggests that the quadratic equation is correct, but when I solved it, I didn't get t = 1 as a solution. That can't be.Wait, let me compute the quadratic equation again.Quadratic equation is:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0Let me plug t = 1:(1 + sqrt(3)) * 1 - 4 * 1 + (1 - sqrt(3)) = (1 + sqrt(3) - 4 + 1 - sqrt(3)) = (-2) + 0 = -2 ≠ 0So, t = 1 is not a solution.But when I plug t = 1 into the equation after moving all terms to the left, it does equal zero. So, there must be a mistake in the process.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion when I squared both sides.Wait, let me re-express the equation after substitution:[ t cos 15° - sin 15° ] / sqrt(1 + t²) = 1/2Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + t²):t cos 15° - sin 15° = (1/2) sqrt(1 + t²)Square both sides:(t cos 15° - sin 15°)^2 = (1/4)(1 + t²)Which is correct.But when I plug t = 1 into this equation, it holds:Left side: (cos 15° - sin 15°)^2 ≈ (0.9659 - 0.2588)^2 ≈ (0.7071)^2 ≈ 0.5Right side: (1/4)(1 + 1) = 0.5So, 0.5 = 0.5, which is correct.But when I plug t = 1 into the quadratic equation, it doesn't hold. So, that suggests that the quadratic equation is incorrect.Wait, but I derived it correctly. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.Wait, let me check the substitution again.Starting from:sin(α - 15°) = 1/2Expressed as:sin α cos 15° - cos α sin 15° = 1/2Expressed in terms of t = tan α:(t / sqrt(1 + t²)) cos 15° - (1 / sqrt(1 + t²)) sin 15° = 1/2Which is:[ t cos 15° - sin 15° ] / sqrt(1 + t²) = 1/2Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 + t²):t cos 15° - sin 15° = (1/2) sqrt(1 + t²)Square both sides:(t cos 15° - sin 15°)^2 = (1/4)(1 + t²)Which is correct.But when I plug t = 1 into this equation, it works, but when I plug t = 1 into the quadratic equation, it doesn't. So, that suggests that the quadratic equation is missing something.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion when moving terms.Wait, let me re-express the equation after squaring:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° = (1/4) + (1/4) t²Now, moving all terms to the left:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° - 1/4 - (1/4) t² = 0Which is:t² (cos² 15° - 1/4) - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + (sin² 15° - 1/4) = 0Which is correct.But when I plug t = 1 into this equation, it equals zero, but when I plug t = 1 into the quadratic equation, it doesn't.Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the coefficients.Wait, let me compute the coefficients again.cos² 15° - 1/4:cos 15° ≈ 0.9659, so cos² 15° ≈ 0.9330.933 - 0.25 ≈ 0.683Similarly, sin² 15° - 1/4:sin 15° ≈ 0.2588, so sin² 15° ≈ 0.066990.06699 - 0.25 ≈ -0.1832 cos 15° sin 15° ≈ 2*0.9659*0.2588 ≈ 0.5So, the quadratic equation is:0.683 t² - 0.5 t - 0.183 = 0Multiply by 1000 to eliminate decimals:683 t² - 500 t - 183 = 0Compute discriminant D = 500² - 4*683*(-183) = 250000 + 4*683*183Compute 4*683 = 2732, 2732*183 ≈ 2732*180 + 2732*3 ≈ 491,760 + 8,196 ≈ 499,956So, D ≈ 250,000 + 499,956 ≈ 749,956sqrt(D) ≈ 866Thus, solutions:t ≈ [500 ± 866] / (2*683) ≈ [500 ± 866]/1366First solution: (500 + 866)/1366 ≈ 1366/1366 ≈ 1Second solution: (500 - 866)/1366 ≈ (-366)/1366 ≈ -0.268So, approximately, t ≈ 1 and t ≈ -0.268Wait, so t ≈ 1 is a solution, which matches our earlier result. So, why did I get different solutions before?Because when I expressed the coefficients in terms of sqrt(3), I might have made an error in the algebra.Wait, let me re-express the quadratic equation:(1 + sqrt(3))/4 t² - t + (1 - sqrt(3))/4 = 0Multiply by 4:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0Let me compute this numerically:1 + sqrt(3) ≈ 1 + 1.732 ≈ 2.7321 - sqrt(3) ≈ 1 - 1.732 ≈ -0.732So, quadratic equation is:2.732 t² - 4 t - 0.732 = 0Compute discriminant D = (-4)^2 - 4*2.732*(-0.732) = 16 + 4*2.732*0.732 ≈ 16 + 4*2.000 ≈ 16 + 8 ≈ 24Wait, 2.732*0.732 ≈ 2.000, so 4*2.000 ≈ 8, so D ≈ 16 + 8 ≈ 24Thus, sqrt(D) ≈ 4.899So, solutions:t = [4 ± 4.899] / (2*2.732) ≈ [4 ± 4.899]/5.464First solution: (4 + 4.899)/5.464 ≈ 8.899/5.464 ≈ 1.628Second solution: (4 - 4.899)/5.464 ≈ (-0.899)/5.464 ≈ -0.1645So, approximately, t ≈ 1.628 and t ≈ -0.1645But when I computed the quadratic equation numerically earlier, I got t ≈ 1 and t ≈ -0.268So, why the discrepancy?Because when I expressed the coefficients in terms of sqrt(3), I had:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0But when I computed numerically, I had:2.732 t² - 4 t - 0.732 = 0Which is correct.But when I plugged t = 1 into this equation, I got:2.732 - 4 - 0.732 ≈ -2 ≠ 0But when I plugged t = 1 into the equation after moving all terms to the left, it equaled zero.Wait, that suggests that the quadratic equation is incorrect.Wait, but I derived it correctly. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.Wait, let me go back to the substitution method.Wait, I think the problem is that when I squared both sides, I introduced an extraneous solution, but also, the correct solution t = 1 is a solution to the squared equation, but when I solved the quadratic equation, I got t ≈ 1.628 and t ≈ -0.1645, but t = 1 is also a solution.Wait, that can't be. A quadratic equation can have only two solutions.Wait, but when I plugged t = 1 into the quadratic equation, it didn't satisfy it, but when I plugged it into the equation after moving all terms to the left, it did.So, perhaps the quadratic equation is incorrect.Wait, let me re-express the equation after squaring:(t cos 15° - sin 15°)^2 = (1/4)(1 + t²)Which is:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° = (1/4) + (1/4) t²Bring all terms to left:t² cos² 15° - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + sin² 15° - 1/4 - (1/4) t² = 0Which is:t² (cos² 15° - 1/4) - 2 t cos 15° sin 15° + (sin² 15° - 1/4) = 0Which is correct.But when I plug t = 1 into this equation, it equals zero, but when I plug t = 1 into the quadratic equation, it doesn't. So, that suggests that the quadratic equation is incorrect.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients.Wait, let me compute cos² 15° - 1/4 and sin² 15° - 1/4 again.cos² 15° = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/4 squared.Wait, no, cos 15° = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/4 * 2, actually, cos 15° = sqrt(2 + sqrt(3))/2, so cos² 15° = (2 + sqrt(3))/4Similarly, sin² 15° = (2 - sqrt(3))/4So, cos² 15° - 1/4 = (2 + sqrt(3))/4 - 1/4 = (1 + sqrt(3))/4Similarly, sin² 15° - 1/4 = (2 - sqrt(3))/4 - 1/4 = (1 - sqrt(3))/4So, that's correct.2 cos 15° sin 15° = sin 30° = 1/2So, the quadratic equation is:(1 + sqrt(3))/4 t² - t + (1 - sqrt(3))/4 = 0Multiply by 4:(1 + sqrt(3)) t² - 4 t + (1 - sqrt(3)) = 0Which is correct.So, why is t = 1 not a solution?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant.Wait, discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4*(1 + sqrt(3))*(1 - sqrt(3)) = 16 - 4*(1 - 3) = 16 - (-8) = 24So, sqrt(D) = 2 sqrt(6)Thus, solutions:t = [4 ± 2 sqrt(6)] / [2*(1 + sqrt(3))] = [2 ± sqrt(6)] / (1 + sqrt(3))Which is correct.But when I plug t = 1 into the quadratic equation, it doesn't satisfy it.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution method, and the correct solution is t = 1, which is not captured by the quadratic equation because of some error.Alternatively, perhaps the substitution method is not the best approach here, and I should stick with the direct solution.Given that when I solved directly, I got α = 45°, which gives tan α = 1, and that satisfies the original equation, I think that is the correct answer.Therefore, despite the substitution method giving me other solutions, which are extraneous, the correct answer is tan α = 1.So, the final answer is 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"As a seasoned anime critic, you are writing a review of a new anime series. You are evaluating episodes based on two criteria: \\"Story Quality\\" and \\"Appropriateness,\\" with particular emphasis on avoiding sexual content. You have determined that the overall score ( S ) of an episode can be modeled by the quadratic equation:[ S = ax^2 + bx + c ]where ( x ) is the number of minutes into the episode, ( a = -0.5 ), ( b = 3 ), and ( c ) is a constant representing your initial impression of the anime. 1. If the overall score ( S ) is required to be at least 5 for the episode to be considered \\"appropriate,\\" determine the range of minutes ( x ) within which the episode maintains this score. Assume ( c = 4 ).2. You also noticed that inappropriate content tends to drop the score drastically. If the score drops to 0 at minute 10, find the new value of ( c ) that would model this scenario.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about evaluating an anime episode using a quadratic equation. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, the overall score ( S ) is given by the quadratic equation:[ S = ax^2 + bx + c ]where ( a = -0.5 ), ( b = 3 ), and ( c ) is a constant. The first part asks me to determine the range of minutes ( x ) within which the episode maintains a score of at least 5, given that ( c = 4 ). Okay, so plugging in the values we have, the equation becomes:[ S = -0.5x^2 + 3x + 4 ]We need to find when ( S geq 5 ). So, set up the inequality:[ -0.5x^2 + 3x + 4 geq 5 ]Subtract 5 from both sides to bring everything to one side:[ -0.5x^2 + 3x + 4 - 5 geq 0 ][ -0.5x^2 + 3x - 1 geq 0 ]Hmm, quadratic inequality. To solve this, I should first find the roots of the equation ( -0.5x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0 ). Let me rewrite the equation to make it easier. Multiply both sides by -2 to eliminate the decimal and the negative coefficient:[ (-2)(-0.5x^2) + (-2)(3x) + (-2)(-1) = 0 ][ x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0 ]Wait, actually, multiplying both sides by -2 changes the inequality sign. But since I'm just solving the equation for equality, the multiplication doesn't affect the roots. So, the quadratic equation becomes:[ x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0 ]Now, let's use the quadratic formula to find the roots. The quadratic formula is:[ x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ]Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -6 ), and ( c = 2 ). Plugging these in:[ x = frac{-(-6) pm sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} ][ x = frac{6 pm sqrt{36 - 8}}{2} ][ x = frac{6 pm sqrt{28}}{2} ]Simplify ( sqrt{28} ). Since 28 is 4*7, ( sqrt{28} = 2sqrt{7} ). So,[ x = frac{6 pm 2sqrt{7}}{2} ][ x = 3 pm sqrt{7} ]So, the roots are ( x = 3 + sqrt{7} ) and ( x = 3 - sqrt{7} ). Calculating the numerical values, ( sqrt{7} ) is approximately 2.6458. So,- ( 3 + 2.6458 approx 5.6458 )- ( 3 - 2.6458 approx 0.3542 )So, the quadratic equation crosses zero at approximately 0.3542 and 5.6458 minutes.Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) in the original inequality was negative (-0.5), the parabola opens downward. That means the quadratic expression ( -0.5x^2 + 3x - 1 ) is positive between the two roots. Therefore, the inequality ( -0.5x^2 + 3x - 1 geq 0 ) holds for ( x ) between approximately 0.3542 and 5.6458 minutes.But wait, the problem is about the score being at least 5. So, the episode is considered appropriate when ( S geq 5 ), which is when ( x ) is between approximately 0.3542 and 5.6458 minutes. But hold on, does this make sense? Because the quadratic equation models the score over time, starting from ( x = 0 ). At ( x = 0 ), plugging into the original equation:[ S = -0.5(0)^2 + 3(0) + 4 = 4 ]So, at the beginning, the score is 4, which is below 5. Then, as time increases, the score increases, reaches a peak, and then decreases. So, the score crosses 5 at approximately 0.3542 minutes and then again at 5.6458 minutes. Therefore, the episode is appropriate (score >=5) between these two times.But wait, 0.3542 minutes is about 21.25 seconds. That seems really short. Is it possible that the score only stays above 5 for a little over 5 minutes? Let me double-check my calculations.Original equation: ( S = -0.5x^2 + 3x + 4 ). We set ( S = 5 ):[ -0.5x^2 + 3x + 4 = 5 ][ -0.5x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0 ]Multiply by -2:[ x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0 ]Quadratic formula:[ x = [6 ± sqrt(36 - 8)] / 2 = [6 ± sqrt(28)] / 2 = 3 ± sqrt(7) ]Which is approximately 3 ± 2.6458, so 5.6458 and 0.3542. That seems correct.But let's think about the vertex of the parabola. The vertex occurs at ( x = -b/(2a) ). In the original equation, ( a = -0.5 ), ( b = 3 ). So,[ x = -3/(2*(-0.5)) = -3 / (-1) = 3 ]So, the vertex is at x = 3 minutes. The maximum score occurs at 3 minutes. Let's calculate the maximum score:[ S = -0.5(3)^2 + 3(3) + 4 = -0.5*9 + 9 + 4 = -4.5 + 9 + 4 = 8.5 ]So, the maximum score is 8.5 at 3 minutes. That makes sense. So, the score starts at 4, goes up to 8.5 at 3 minutes, and then comes back down. It crosses 5 at approximately 0.3542 and 5.6458 minutes. So, the appropriate time range is from about 0.35 minutes to 5.65 minutes.But in the context of an anime episode, 5.65 minutes is still quite short. Maybe the episode is only 10 minutes long? Or perhaps the model is only valid for a certain duration. The problem doesn't specify, but it just asks for the range where S is at least 5. So, based on the quadratic model, it's between approximately 0.35 and 5.65 minutes.But since the problem is about the entire episode, perhaps the entire episode is 10 minutes? Because in part 2, it mentions that the score drops to 0 at minute 10. Hmm, maybe the episode is 10 minutes long. So, in that case, the appropriate time is from about 0.35 to 5.65 minutes, which is roughly 5.3 minutes of the 10-minute episode.But the question is just asking for the range of x where S >=5, regardless of the episode length. So, the answer is between 3 - sqrt(7) and 3 + sqrt(7) minutes. Since 3 - sqrt(7) is approximately 0.3542 and 3 + sqrt(7) is approximately 5.6458.So, the range is from ( 3 - sqrt{7} ) to ( 3 + sqrt{7} ) minutes.Wait, but the problem says \\"the range of minutes x within which the episode maintains this score.\\" So, it's the interval where S >=5, which is between the two roots. So, in exact terms, it's [3 - sqrt(7), 3 + sqrt(7)].But let me check if I did everything correctly. The quadratic was set up correctly, solved for S=5, found the roots, and since the parabola opens downward, the inequality holds between the roots. So, yes, that seems right.Now, moving on to part 2. It says that inappropriate content tends to drop the score drastically, and the score drops to 0 at minute 10. We need to find the new value of c that would model this scenario.So, previously, c was 4, but now, with the score dropping to 0 at x=10, we need to find the new c.Given the quadratic equation:[ S = -0.5x^2 + 3x + c ]We know that at x=10, S=0. So, plug in x=10 and S=0:[ 0 = -0.5(10)^2 + 3(10) + c ][ 0 = -0.5*100 + 30 + c ][ 0 = -50 + 30 + c ][ 0 = -20 + c ][ c = 20 ]Wait, so c becomes 20? Let me verify that.Plugging x=10 into the equation with c=20:[ S = -0.5(100) + 30 + 20 = -50 + 30 + 20 = 0 ]Yes, that works. So, the new value of c is 20.But wait, let me think again. The original equation with c=4 had the score starting at 4, peaking at 8.5, and then decreasing. Now, with c=20, the starting score would be 20, which is much higher. Then, it would peak even higher and then decrease to 0 at x=10.Is that the case? Let me check the vertex again with c=20.Vertex at x=3, as before, since a and b haven't changed.So,[ S = -0.5(3)^2 + 3(3) + 20 = -4.5 + 9 + 20 = 24.5 ]So, the maximum score is 24.5 at x=3, which is way higher. Then, it decreases to 0 at x=10. That seems like a drastic drop, as mentioned in the problem.But the problem says that inappropriate content tends to drop the score drastically. So, perhaps in this case, the score starts higher but then plummets to 0 at 10 minutes. So, c=20 is the new constant.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.Given S = -0.5x² + 3x + cAt x=10, S=0:0 = -0.5*(10)^2 + 3*10 + c0 = -50 + 30 + c0 = -20 + cc = 20Yes, that's correct.So, the new value of c is 20.But just to be thorough, let me check another point. For example, at x=0, S would be c=20. So, the initial score is 20, which is much higher than before. Then, it goes up to 24.5 at x=3, and then comes down to 0 at x=10.So, that makes sense. The score starts high, peaks, and then drops to 0 at 10 minutes because of inappropriate content.Therefore, the new value of c is 20.**Final Answer**1. The range of minutes is boxed{[3 - sqrt{7}, 3 + sqrt{7}]}.2. The new value of ( c ) is boxed{20}."},{"question":"Simplify first, then evaluate: 5x^{2}-2xy+3left(xy+2right)-1, where x=-2 and y=1.","answer":"First, I will simplify the expression (5x^{2} - 2xy + 3(xy + 2) - 1).I start by distributing the 3 into the parentheses, which gives me (3xy + 6).Next, I combine like terms.

The growth of the bacteria is modeled by the quadratic equation ( N(t) = -2t^2 + 12t + 20 ), where ( N(t) ) is the number of bacteria in thousands at time ( t ) hours.1. At what time ( t ) does the bacterial population reach its maximum? Determine the maximum number of bacteria at that time.2. Due to a change in environmental conditions, the bacterial population must be kept below 50,000. For how long (in hours) is the population above this threshold?","answer":"Okay, so I'm a Biology student working on this experiment with bacterial growth. The problem gives me a quadratic equation to model the growth: ( N(t) = -2t^2 + 12t + 20 ). Here, ( N(t) ) represents the number of bacteria in thousands at time ( t ) hours. There are two parts to this problem. The first one is asking me to find the time ( t ) when the bacterial population reaches its maximum and also determine that maximum number. The second part is about figuring out for how long the population stays above 50,000, considering that the environmental conditions require it to be kept below that threshold.Starting with the first part: finding the maximum population and the time it occurs. Since the equation is quadratic, I know that the graph of this function is a parabola. The coefficient of the ( t^2 ) term is -2, which is negative, so the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola is the maximum point. So, the vertex will give me both the time ( t ) and the maximum number of bacteria.I remember that for a quadratic function in the form ( at^2 + bt + c ), the time ( t ) at which the vertex occurs is given by ( t = -frac{b}{2a} ). In this equation, ( a = -2 ) and ( b = 12 ). Plugging those into the formula:( t = -frac{12}{2 times -2} )Let me compute that step by step. First, compute the denominator: 2 times -2 is -4. Then, the numerator is -12. So,( t = -frac{12}{-4} )Dividing -12 by -4 gives 3. So, the time at which the maximum occurs is at ( t = 3 ) hours.Now, to find the maximum number of bacteria, I need to plug this ( t = 3 ) back into the original equation ( N(t) ).So, ( N(3) = -2(3)^2 + 12(3) + 20 ).Calculating each term:First, ( (3)^2 = 9 ). Multiply that by -2: ( -2 times 9 = -18 ).Next, ( 12 times 3 = 36 ).Then, we have the constant term +20.Adding all those together: ( -18 + 36 + 20 ).Let me compute step by step:-18 + 36 is 18.18 + 20 is 38.So, ( N(3) = 38 ).But wait, the problem says ( N(t) ) is the number of bacteria in thousands. So, 38 in the equation corresponds to 38,000 bacteria.Therefore, the maximum number of bacteria is 38,000, occurring at 3 hours.Wait, hold on, let me double-check my calculations because 38 seems a bit low given the coefficients. Let me recalculate ( N(3) ):( N(3) = -2(9) + 12(3) + 20 )Which is:-18 + 36 + 20.-18 + 36 is indeed 18, and 18 + 20 is 38. So, 38,000 bacteria. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Let me think about the quadratic equation.Alternatively, maybe I can find the maximum using calculus, just to confirm. Taking the derivative of ( N(t) ) with respect to ( t ):( N'(t) = -4t + 12 ).Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:-4t + 12 = 0-4t = -12t = 3.So, same result. Then, plugging back into N(t):( N(3) = -2(9) + 36 + 20 = -18 + 36 + 20 = 38 ). So, yes, 38,000 bacteria at 3 hours. That seems consistent.Moving on to the second part: the bacterial population must be kept below 50,000. So, we need to find the time intervals when the population is above 50,000. Since the population is modeled by ( N(t) = -2t^2 + 12t + 20 ), and ( N(t) ) is in thousands, 50,000 bacteria would correspond to ( N(t) = 50 ).So, we need to solve the inequality:( -2t^2 + 12t + 20 > 50 )First, let's rewrite this inequality:( -2t^2 + 12t + 20 - 50 > 0 )Simplify:( -2t^2 + 12t - 30 > 0 )Let me write it as:( -2t^2 + 12t - 30 > 0 )Alternatively, I can multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of ( t^2 ) positive, but I have to remember to reverse the inequality sign when multiplying by a negative number.So, multiplying both sides by -1:( 2t^2 - 12t + 30 < 0 )Now, we have ( 2t^2 - 12t + 30 < 0 ). Let's see if this quadratic ever goes below zero.First, let's find the discriminant to see if there are real roots.Discriminant ( D = b^2 - 4ac )Here, ( a = 2 ), ( b = -12 ), ( c = 30 ).So,( D = (-12)^2 - 4(2)(30) = 144 - 240 = -96 )Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots. That means the quadratic ( 2t^2 - 12t + 30 ) never crosses the t-axis and since the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is positive, it opens upwards. Therefore, the quadratic is always positive. So, ( 2t^2 - 12t + 30 ) is always greater than zero, meaning the original inequality ( -2t^2 + 12t - 30 > 0 ) is never true.Wait, that can't be right because the population does reach a maximum of 38,000, which is below 50,000. So, the population never exceeds 50,000. Therefore, the population is never above 50,000, so the duration when it's above is zero.But wait, let me double-check my steps because this seems conflicting with the initial thought.Wait, the original equation is ( N(t) = -2t^2 + 12t + 20 ). The maximum is 38,000, which is less than 50,000. So, the population never exceeds 50,000. Therefore, the time when the population is above 50,000 is zero. So, the answer is that the population never exceeds 50,000, so the duration is zero hours.But wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the inequality. Let me check again.We have ( N(t) = -2t^2 + 12t + 20 ). We need to find when ( N(t) > 50 ). So, ( -2t^2 + 12t + 20 > 50 ). Subtract 50 from both sides:( -2t^2 + 12t - 30 > 0 )Which is the same as:( -2t^2 + 12t - 30 > 0 )Alternatively, multiplying both sides by -1 (and flipping inequality):( 2t^2 - 12t + 30 < 0 )As before, discriminant is negative, so no real roots. Since the quadratic opens upwards (positive coefficient on ( t^2 )), it is always positive. Therefore, ( 2t^2 - 12t + 30 ) is always positive, so the original inequality ( -2t^2 + 12t - 30 > 0 ) is never true. Therefore, the population never exceeds 50,000.But wait, the maximum population is 38,000, which is indeed below 50,000, so that makes sense. Therefore, the population is never above 50,000, so the duration is zero hours.But let me think again. Maybe I should graph the function or test some points to confirm.At t=0: N(0) = 20,000At t=3: N(3)=38,000At t=6: N(6)= -2(36) + 72 + 20 = -72 + 72 + 20 = 20,000So, the population starts at 20,000, peaks at 38,000 at t=3, then goes back down to 20,000 at t=6.So, it never reaches 50,000. Therefore, the population is always below 50,000, so the duration when it's above is zero.Alternatively, maybe the question is worded differently. It says the population must be kept below 50,000. So, if it's never above, then the time it's above is zero. So, the answer is zero hours.But just to make sure, let me consider if perhaps I misread the equation. The equation is ( N(t) = -2t^2 + 12t + 20 ). So, at t=0, it's 20,000. The maximum is 38,000, which is less than 50,000. So, yes, it never exceeds 50,000.Therefore, the second answer is zero hours.But wait, maybe I should present it as such. So, the population is always below 50,000, so the time it's above is zero.Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, but given the math, it seems correct.So, summarizing:1. The maximum occurs at t=3 hours, with 38,000 bacteria.2. The population is never above 50,000, so the duration is zero hours.I think that's the conclusion."},{"question":"Find the point ( M' ) that is symmetric to point ( M ) relative to the plane.( M(0, -3, -2) )( 2x + 10y + 10z - 1 = 0 )","answer":"Alright, so I need to find the point ( M' ) that's symmetric to the point ( M(0, -3, -2) ) with respect to the plane given by the equation ( 2x + 10y + 10z - 1 = 0 ). Hmm, okay. I remember that reflecting a point over a plane involves finding a point on the other side of the plane such that the plane is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the original point and its reflection. First, maybe I should recall the formula for reflecting a point over a plane. I think it involves finding the projection of the point onto the plane and then using that to determine the symmetric point. Let me try to remember the steps.So, if I have a point ( M ) and a plane, the reflection ( M' ) can be found by first finding the projection ( P ) of ( M ) onto the plane. Then, ( M' ) is such that ( P ) is the midpoint between ( M ) and ( M' ). That makes sense because the plane is the perpendicular bisector.So, step one: find the projection ( P ) of ( M ) onto the plane. To do this, I need to find the point where the line perpendicular to the plane passes through ( M ) and intersects the plane.The plane equation is ( 2x + 10y + 10z - 1 = 0 ). The normal vector to the plane is given by the coefficients of ( x, y, z ), so that's ( vec{n} = (2, 10, 10) ). To find the projection, I can parametrize the line passing through ( M ) and in the direction of the normal vector. Let me write that parametric equation.Let ( t ) be a parameter. Then, the parametric equations of the line are:( x = 0 + 2t )( y = -3 + 10t )( z = -2 + 10t )So, substituting these into the plane equation to find the value of ( t ) where the line intersects the plane.Plugging into ( 2x + 10y + 10z - 1 = 0 ):( 2(2t) + 10(-3 + 10t) + 10(-2 + 10t) - 1 = 0 )Let me compute each term:First term: ( 2(2t) = 4t )Second term: ( 10(-3 + 10t) = -30 + 100t )Third term: ( 10(-2 + 10t) = -20 + 100t )Fourth term: ( -1 )So, adding all together:( 4t - 30 + 100t - 20 + 100t - 1 = 0 )Combine like terms:The ( t ) terms: ( 4t + 100t + 100t = 204t )The constants: ( -30 -20 -1 = -51 )So, equation becomes:( 204t - 51 = 0 )Solving for ( t ):( 204t = 51 )( t = 51 / 204 )Simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 51.51 ÷ 51 = 1204 ÷ 51 = 4So, ( t = 1/4 )Okay, so ( t = 1/4 ). Now, plug this back into the parametric equations to find the projection point ( P ).Compute each coordinate:( x = 0 + 2*(1/4) = 0 + 0.5 = 0.5 )( y = -3 + 10*(1/4) = -3 + 2.5 = -0.5 )( z = -2 + 10*(1/4) = -2 + 2.5 = 0.5 )So, the projection point ( P ) is ( (0.5, -0.5, 0.5) ).Now, since ( P ) is the midpoint between ( M ) and ( M' ), we can use the midpoint formula to find ( M' ).Let me denote ( M'(x', y', z') ). Then, the midpoint ( P ) is given by:( P_x = (M_x + M'_x)/2 )( P_y = (M_y + M'_y)/2 )( P_z = (M_z + M'_z)/2 )We can rearrange each equation to solve for ( M'_x, M'_y, M'_z ):( M'_x = 2P_x - M_x )( M'_y = 2P_y - M_y )( M'_z = 2P_z - M_z )Plugging in the values:( M'_x = 2*0.5 - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1 )( M'_y = 2*(-0.5) - (-3) = -1 + 3 = 2 )( M'_z = 2*0.5 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3 )So, ( M' ) is ( (1, 2, 3) ).Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, projection point ( P ):- ( x = 0 + 2*(1/4) = 0.5 ) ✔️- ( y = -3 + 10*(1/4) = -3 + 2.5 = -0.5 ) ✔️- ( z = -2 + 10*(1/4) = -2 + 2.5 = 0.5 ) ✔️Midpoint calculations:- ( M'_x = 2*0.5 - 0 = 1 ) ✔️- ( M'_y = 2*(-0.5) - (-3) = -1 + 3 = 2 ) ✔️- ( M'_z = 2*0.5 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3 ) ✔️Seems correct. So, the reflection point ( M' ) is ( (1, 2, 3) ).Alternatively, I can verify this by checking that the midpoint between ( M ) and ( M' ) is indeed ( P ), and that the vector ( M'M ) is perpendicular to the plane.Midpoint between ( M(0, -3, -2) ) and ( M'(1, 2, 3) ):( x ): ( (0 + 1)/2 = 0.5 )( y ): ( (-3 + 2)/2 = (-1)/2 = -0.5 )( z ): ( (-2 + 3)/2 = 1/2 = 0.5 )Which is exactly ( P(0.5, -0.5, 0.5) ). Good.Now, checking if the vector ( M'M ) is perpendicular to the plane. The vector ( M'M ) is ( M - M' ):( (0 - 1, -3 - 2, -2 - 3) = (-1, -5, -5) )The normal vector of the plane is ( (2, 10, 10) ). If ( M'M ) is perpendicular to the plane, then ( M'M ) should be parallel to the normal vector.Indeed, ( (-1, -5, -5) ) is just ( -1/2 times (2, 10, 10) ). So, yes, they are scalar multiples, meaning the vector is parallel to the normal vector. Therefore, the line ( MM' ) is perpendicular to the plane, which confirms that ( M' ) is indeed the reflection of ( M ) over the plane.So, I think that's correct. ( M' ) is ( (1, 2, 3) ).**Final Answer**The symmetric point ( M' ) is boxed{(1, 2, 3)}."},{"question":"A busy parent, Alex, is researching two different brands of eco-friendly cleaning products for their home. Brand A sells a concentrated cleaning solution that requires dilution with water before use. The instructions say to mix the concentrate with water in a ratio of 1:4 (1 part concentrate to 4 parts water). Alex wants to make 5 liters of the diluted solution.1. How many liters of the concentrate from Brand A does Alex need to use? Express your answer as a simplified rational expression and then compute the value.Additionally, Alex is considering another option, Brand B, which claims its cleaning solution lasts longer. The effectiveness of Brand B's solution decreases quadratically with time, and can be modeled by the function ( E(t) = -2t^2 + 16t + 32 ), where ( E(t) ) represents the effectiveness after ( t ) days.2. Determine the number of days, ( t ), after which the effectiveness of Brand B's solution drops to zero. Solve the quadratic equation and find the possible values of ( t ).","answer":"Okay, so I have two problems here that Alex is dealing with. Let me try to tackle them one by one. Starting with the first problem about Brand A's eco-friendly cleaning product. The ratio given is 1:4, which means 1 part concentrate to 4 parts water. Alex wants to make 5 liters of the diluted solution. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can figure this out.First, I need to understand what the ratio 1:4 signifies. It means that for every 1 part of concentrate, you add 4 parts of water. So, the total number of parts in the solution is 1 + 4 = 5 parts. That makes sense because 1 part is concentrate and 4 parts are water. Now, Alex wants to make 5 liters of the diluted solution. Since the total parts are 5, each part must be equal to 1 liter because 5 liters divided by 5 parts is 1 liter per part. Therefore, the amount of concentrate needed would be 1 part, which is 1 liter. Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check. If 1 part is 1 liter, then 4 parts water would be 4 liters. Adding them together gives 1 + 4 = 5 liters, which is exactly what Alex needs. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as a fraction. The concentrate makes up 1/5 of the total solution. So, 1/5 of 5 liters is 1 liter. That also gives the same result. So, for the first part, Alex needs 1 liter of concentrate from Brand A. Moving on to the second problem about Brand B's cleaning solution. The effectiveness is modeled by the function ( E(t) = -2t^2 + 16t + 32 ). We need to find the number of days, ( t ), after which the effectiveness drops to zero. This means we need to solve the quadratic equation ( -2t^2 + 16t + 32 = 0 ). Quadratic equations can be solved using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. Let me see if this can be factored or if I need to use the quadratic formula.First, let's write the equation:( -2t^2 + 16t + 32 = 0 )I notice that all the coefficients are even, so maybe I can factor out a common factor first. Let's factor out -2:( -2(t^2 - 8t - 16) = 0 )Wait, hold on. If I factor out -2, the signs inside the parentheses will change. Let me check:( -2t^2 + 16t + 32 = -2(t^2 - 8t - 16) )Yes, that's correct. So, the equation becomes:( -2(t^2 - 8t - 16) = 0 )Since -2 is not zero, we can divide both sides by -2 to simplify:( t^2 - 8t - 16 = 0 )Now, we have a simpler quadratic equation: ( t^2 - 8t - 16 = 0 ). Let's see if this can be factored. I need two numbers that multiply to -16 and add up to -8. Hmm, the factors of 16 are 1 & 16, 2 & 8, 4 & 4. Since the product is negative, one number is positive and the other is negative. Let's see:- If I take  -8 and +2, their product is -16 and their sum is -6. Not quite.- If I take -16 and +1, their product is -16 and their sum is -15. Nope.- If I take -4 and +4, their product is -16 and their sum is 0. Not helpful.It seems like this quadratic doesn't factor nicely with integers. So, I think the quadratic formula is the way to go here. The quadratic formula is:( t = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )In our equation, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -8 ), and ( c = -16 ). Plugging these into the formula:First, compute the discriminant:( b^2 - 4ac = (-8)^2 - 4(1)(-16) = 64 + 64 = 128 )So, the discriminant is 128. Now, plugging back into the formula:( t = frac{-(-8) pm sqrt{128}}{2(1)} = frac{8 pm sqrt{128}}{2} )Simplify ( sqrt{128} ). Since 128 is 64 * 2, ( sqrt{128} = sqrt{64 * 2} = 8sqrt{2} ).So, substituting back:( t = frac{8 pm 8sqrt{2}}{2} )We can factor out 8 in the numerator:( t = frac{8(1 pm sqrt{2})}{2} )Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:( t = 4(1 pm sqrt{2}) )So, the solutions are:( t = 4(1 + sqrt{2}) ) and ( t = 4(1 - sqrt{2}) )Now, let's compute these values numerically to understand them better.First, ( sqrt{2} ) is approximately 1.4142.So, ( 1 + sqrt{2} approx 1 + 1.4142 = 2.4142 )Multiply by 4: ( 4 * 2.4142 approx 9.6568 ) days.Next, ( 1 - sqrt{2} approx 1 - 1.4142 = -0.4142 )Multiply by 4: ( 4 * (-0.4142) approx -1.6568 ) days.But time cannot be negative in this context, so we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the effectiveness drops to zero after approximately 9.6568 days.But since the question asks for the number of days, and days are typically counted as whole numbers, we might need to consider whether to round up or down. However, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can leave it as an exact value or provide both solutions.Wait, let me check the original equation. It's ( E(t) = -2t^2 + 16t + 32 ). The effectiveness is a quadratic function opening downward because the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is negative. So, the graph is a parabola opening downward, which means it will cross the t-axis at two points: one positive and one negative. Since negative time doesn't make sense in this context, only the positive solution is relevant.Therefore, the effectiveness drops to zero at ( t = 4(1 + sqrt{2}) ) days. If we want an exact value, that's fine, but if a numerical approximation is needed, it's approximately 9.6568 days.But let me think again. The quadratic equation was ( -2t^2 + 16t + 32 = 0 ). When I factored out -2, I got ( t^2 - 8t - 16 = 0 ). So, the solutions are ( t = [8 ± sqrt(64 + 64)] / 2 = [8 ± sqrt(128)] / 2 ). Which is the same as before.Alternatively, maybe I can write the solutions as ( t = 4 + 4sqrt{2} ) and ( t = 4 - 4sqrt{2} ). Since ( 4sqrt{2} ) is approximately 5.6568, so 4 + 5.6568 is approximately 9.6568, and 4 - 5.6568 is approximately -1.6568. So, same result.Therefore, the only meaningful solution is ( t = 4 + 4sqrt{2} ) days, which is approximately 9.66 days.So, summarizing:1. For Brand A, Alex needs 1 liter of concentrate.2. For Brand B, the effectiveness drops to zero after ( t = 4 + 4sqrt{2} ) days, approximately 9.66 days.I think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.For the first problem, ratio 1:4, total 5 parts, 5 liters, so 1 liter concentrate. That seems solid.For the second problem, quadratic equation solved correctly. Discriminant was 128, square root of 128 is 8√2, so solutions are (8 ± 8√2)/2 = 4 ± 4√2. Negative solution discarded, so 4 + 4√2 is the answer. Yep, that looks right.**Final Answer**1. Alex needs boxed{1} liter of concentrate from Brand A.2. The effectiveness of Brand B's solution drops to zero after boxed{4 + 4sqrt{2}} days."},{"question":"Determine the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) within the plane region defined by the system of inequalities begin{cases} x > 0  y > 0  4x + 3y < 12 end{cases}","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of lattice points within a certain region defined by some inequalities. The inequalities are:1. ( x > 0 )2. ( y > 0 )3. ( 4x + 3y < 12 )Okay, so first, let me visualize this region. Since both ( x ) and ( y ) are greater than 0, we're dealing with the first quadrant. The third inequality is a linear inequality, so it should form a straight line when we consider the equality ( 4x + 3y = 12 ). The region defined by ( 4x + 3y < 12 ) will be below this line.I think the best approach is to sketch the region to get a better idea. So, let me find the intercepts of the line ( 4x + 3y = 12 ). - When ( x = 0 ), ( 3y = 12 ) so ( y = 4 ). So, the y-intercept is at (0, 4).- When ( y = 0 ), ( 4x = 12 ) so ( x = 3 ). So, the x-intercept is at (3, 0).Therefore, the line connects the points (3, 0) and (0, 4). Since we're dealing with the first quadrant, the region we're interested in is the triangle formed by the points (0, 0), (3, 0), and (0, 4), but excluding the boundary because the inequalities are strict (i.e., ( x > 0 ), ( y > 0 ), and ( 4x + 3y < 12 )).Wait, actually, hold on. The inequalities are ( x > 0 ) and ( y > 0 ), which means we don't include the axes themselves. So, the region is an open triangle, not including the boundaries. Hmm, but lattice points are points with integer coordinates, so even if the boundaries aren't included, the lattice points on the boundaries would still have integer coordinates, but since the inequalities are strict, those points wouldn't be included. So, I need to be careful not to count any points on the axes or on the line ( 4x + 3y = 12 ).So, my task is to count all the integer coordinate points (lattice points) inside this open triangle. Let me think about how to approach this systematically.One way is to iterate through possible integer values of ( x ) and for each ( x ), determine the range of ( y ) values that satisfy the inequalities, then count the integer ( y )s in that range.Given that ( x > 0 ) and ( y > 0 ), both ( x ) and ( y ) must be positive integers. Also, since ( 4x + 3y < 12 ), we can find the maximum possible ( x ) and ( y ).Let me find the maximum value ( x ) can take. Since ( x ) is a positive integer, let's see what happens when ( y ) is at its minimum, which is 1.So, plugging ( y = 1 ) into ( 4x + 3y < 12 ), we get ( 4x + 3 < 12 ) which simplifies to ( 4x < 9 ), so ( x < 9/4 = 2.25 ). Since ( x ) must be an integer, the maximum ( x ) can be is 2. Wait, but let me check for ( y = 1 ), ( x ) can be 1 or 2.Wait, hold on, actually, ( x ) can be as large as possible such that ( 4x < 12 ). So, if ( y = 0 ), ( x ) could be up to 2, but since ( y > 0 ), ( x ) must be less. Hmm, maybe I should approach this by considering each possible ( x ) starting from 1 and find the corresponding ( y ) values.So, let's start with ( x = 1 ).For ( x = 1 ):The inequality becomes ( 4(1) + 3y < 12 ) which simplifies to ( 4 + 3y < 12 ) or ( 3y < 8 ). So, ( y < 8/3 approx 2.666 ). Since ( y ) must be a positive integer, the possible ( y ) values are 1 and 2. So, for ( x = 1 ), we have 2 lattice points: (1,1) and (1,2).Next, ( x = 2 ):The inequality becomes ( 4(2) + 3y < 12 ) which is ( 8 + 3y < 12 ) or ( 3y < 4 ). So, ( y < 4/3 approx 1.333 ). Since ( y ) must be a positive integer, the only possible value is ( y = 1 ). So, for ( x = 2 ), we have 1 lattice point: (2,1).Now, ( x = 3 ):Wait, ( x = 3 ) would give ( 4(3) + 3y = 12 + 3y ), which is already greater than 12, so ( x = 3 ) is not allowed because ( 4x + 3y < 12 ) would require ( 12 + 3y < 12 ), which is impossible. So, ( x ) cannot be 3 or higher.Wait, hold on, let me double-check that. If ( x = 3 ), then ( 4(3) = 12 ), so ( 12 + 3y < 12 ) implies ( 3y < 0 ), which is impossible since ( y > 0 ). So, indeed, ( x ) cannot be 3 or higher. So, the maximum ( x ) is 2.Wait, but what about ( x = 0 )? But ( x > 0 ), so ( x ) starts from 1.So, so far, I have 2 points for ( x = 1 ) and 1 point for ( x = 2 ), totaling 3 points. But wait, that seems low. Maybe I missed something.Wait, perhaps I should consider that ( y ) can also be higher for smaller ( x ). For example, when ( x = 1 ), ( y ) can be 1 or 2, but maybe for ( x = 0 ), but ( x > 0 ), so ( x = 0 ) is excluded. Hmm.Wait, perhaps I should also consider the line ( 4x + 3y = 12 ) and see if any lattice points lie on it, but since the inequality is strict, those points aren't included. So, I don't have to worry about excluding them because they aren't part of the region.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should approach this using Pick's Theorem, which relates the area of a polygon with the number of lattice points on its boundary and interior. But since the region is an open triangle, I'm not sure if Pick's Theorem applies directly because it usually applies to polygons with integer coordinates and includes boundary points. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area and then estimate the number of lattice points, but that might not be precise.Wait, let me go back to my initial approach. Maybe I missed some points.So, for ( x = 1 ):( 4(1) + 3y < 12 ) → ( 3y < 8 ) → ( y < 8/3 ≈ 2.666 ). So, ( y = 1, 2 ). That's two points.For ( x = 2 ):( 4(2) + 3y < 12 ) → ( 8 + 3y < 12 ) → ( 3y < 4 ) → ( y < 4/3 ≈ 1.333 ). So, ( y = 1 ). One point.Wait, but what about ( x = 3 )? As I thought earlier, it's not allowed because ( 4(3) = 12 ), and ( y ) has to be positive, so ( 4x + 3y ) would be at least 12, which violates the inequality.Wait, but what about ( x = 0 )? But ( x > 0 ), so ( x = 0 ) is excluded.Wait, but maybe I should check for ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 3 ). Let me plug in ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 3 ): ( 4(1) + 3(3) = 4 + 9 = 13 ), which is greater than 12, so that's outside the region.Similarly, ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 2 ): ( 4(2) + 3(2) = 8 + 6 = 14 ), which is also outside.Wait, so maybe I didn't miss any points. So, total points are 3.But that seems too low. Let me try another approach.Alternatively, I can consider all possible integer points in the first quadrant where ( x geq 1 ) and ( y geq 1 ), and ( 4x + 3y < 12 ).Let me list them out.Starting with ( x = 1 ):- ( y = 1 ): ( 4 + 3 = 7 < 12 ) → valid- ( y = 2 ): ( 4 + 6 = 10 < 12 ) → valid- ( y = 3 ): ( 4 + 9 = 13 ) → invalidSo, two points: (1,1), (1,2)( x = 2 ):- ( y = 1 ): ( 8 + 3 = 11 < 12 ) → valid- ( y = 2 ): ( 8 + 6 = 14 ) → invalidSo, one point: (2,1)( x = 3 ):- ( y = 1 ): ( 12 + 3 = 15 ) → invalidSo, no points.Wait, so that's 3 points in total. But I feel like that's too few. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, let me check ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 3 ): as above, it's 13, which is too big. ( y = 2 ) is 10, which is fine.Wait, but what about ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 0 )? But ( y > 0 ), so that's excluded.Similarly, ( x = 0 ) is excluded.Wait, maybe I should consider that the region is bounded by ( x > 0 ), ( y > 0 ), and ( 4x + 3y < 12 ), so it's an open region, but perhaps I should also consider that the line ( 4x + 3y = 12 ) doesn't pass through any other lattice points besides the intercepts.Wait, let me check if there are any other lattice points on the line ( 4x + 3y = 12 ).We already have (3,0) and (0,4). Let's see if there are others.Let me solve for integer solutions:( 4x + 3y = 12 )Looking for positive integers ( x ) and ( y ).Let me try ( x = 1 ): ( 4 + 3y = 12 ) → ( 3y = 8 ) → ( y = 8/3 ) → not integer.( x = 2 ): ( 8 + 3y = 12 ) → ( 3y = 4 ) → ( y = 4/3 ) → not integer.( x = 3 ): ( 12 + 3y = 12 ) → ( y = 0 ) → which is already considered.So, no other lattice points on the line besides the intercepts.Therefore, the only lattice points on the boundary are (3,0) and (0,4), which are excluded because of the strict inequalities.So, going back, I have 3 lattice points inside the region: (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1).Wait, but I'm still not sure. Maybe I should visualize it again.The region is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (3,0), and (0,4). The open region excludes the axes and the line itself. So, the lattice points inside would be those strictly inside the triangle.But when I list them, I only get 3 points. Let me check if there are more.Wait, perhaps I should consider ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 1 ), ( y = 2 ); ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 1 ). Are there any others?Wait, what about ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 3 )? As above, that's 13, which is outside.( x = 2 ) and ( y = 2 ): 14, which is outside.( x = 1 ) and ( y = 0 ): excluded.( x = 0 ) and ( y = 1 ): excluded.So, yes, only 3 points.Wait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when counting lattice points, it's easy to miss some.Alternatively, maybe I can use a different method.Let me consider the inequality ( 4x + 3y < 12 ). Since ( x ) and ( y ) are positive integers, I can rewrite this as ( y < (12 - 4x)/3 ).So, for each ( x geq 1 ), ( y ) must be less than ( (12 - 4x)/3 ). Since ( y ) must be at least 1, the number of possible ( y ) values is the floor of ( (12 - 4x)/3 - 1 ), but I have to be careful.Wait, actually, since ( y ) must be an integer greater than 0 and less than ( (12 - 4x)/3 ), the number of possible ( y ) values is the floor of ( (12 - 4x)/3 - 1 ), but only if ( (12 - 4x)/3 > 1 ). Otherwise, there are no solutions.Wait, maybe it's better to compute for each ( x ), the maximum ( y ) such that ( y < (12 - 4x)/3 ).So, for ( x = 1 ):( y < (12 - 4)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.666 ). So, ( y = 1, 2 ). Two points.For ( x = 2 ):( y < (12 - 8)/3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 ). So, ( y = 1 ). One point.For ( x = 3 ):( y < (12 - 12)/3 = 0 ). So, no solutions.So, total points: 2 + 1 = 3.Therefore, the number of lattice points is 3.Wait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when I count lattice points, I might miss some edge cases, but in this case, it seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can use a table to list all possible ( x ) and ( y ) values.Let me create a table with ( x ) from 1 to 2 and ( y ) from 1 upwards, checking if ( 4x + 3y < 12 ).For ( x = 1 ):- ( y = 1 ): 4 + 3 = 7 < 12 → valid- ( y = 2 ): 4 + 6 = 10 < 12 → valid- ( y = 3 ): 4 + 9 = 13 ≥ 12 → invalidSo, two points.For ( x = 2 ):- ( y = 1 ): 8 + 3 = 11 < 12 → valid- ( y = 2 ): 8 + 6 = 14 ≥ 12 → invalidSo, one point.For ( x = 3 ):- ( y = 1 ): 12 + 3 = 15 ≥ 12 → invalidSo, no points.Thus, the total number of lattice points is 3.Wait, but I just thought of something. What about ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 0 )? But ( y > 0 ), so that's excluded. Similarly, ( x = 0 ) is excluded.Therefore, I think I've accounted for all possible points.So, the final answer is 3 lattice points.But wait, let me double-check once more. Maybe I can plot the points:- (1,1): 4 + 3 = 7 < 12 → valid- (1,2): 4 + 6 = 10 < 12 → valid- (2,1): 8 + 3 = 11 < 12 → validAre there any others?- (2,2): 8 + 6 = 14 ≥ 12 → invalid- (1,3): 4 + 9 = 13 ≥ 12 → invalid- (3,1): 12 + 3 = 15 ≥ 12 → invalidSo, no, those are the only ones.Therefore, the number of lattice points is 3.**Final Answer**The number of lattice points within the region is boxed{3}."},{"question":"The local grocery store owner has a legal contract with a supplier that specifies a discount schedule based on the quantity of goods purchased. The contract, prepared by their trusted lawyer, outlines that for every x units ordered over the base quantity of 100 units, the store receives a discount of 3 per unit. However, the cost per unit before discount is 15. 1. Write an equation that represents the total cost C(x) for purchasing x additional units beyond the base 100 units. Then, determine the number of additional units, x, that need to be purchased to keep the total cost under 1,200.2. If the grocery store decides to increase its order to x + y units over the base quantity, where y represents a special promotional bonus of 10 units given by the supplier, find and simplify the expression for the new total cost. Assume the same discount applies to the entire order.","answer":"First, I need to understand the discount structure. The base quantity is 100 units, and for every additional unit beyond this, the store gets a 3 discount per unit. The original cost per unit is 15, so the discounted cost per additional unit would be 15 minus 3, which is 12 per unit.Next, I'll write the equation for the total cost ( C(x) ). The total cost includes the cost of the base 100 units plus the cost of the additional ( x ) units at the discounted rate. Therefore, the equation is:[C(x) = 100 times 15 + 12x = 1500 + 12x]Now, to find out how many additional units ( x ) can be purchased while keeping the total cost under 1,200, I'll set up the inequality:[1500 + 12x < 1200]Subtracting 1500 from both sides gives:[12x < -300]Dividing both sides by 12:[x < -25]This result indicates that purchasing additional units beyond the base quantity would actually increase the total cost, making it impossible to keep the total cost under 1,200. Therefore, no additional units should be purchased.For the second part, if the store increases its order by ( x + y ) units, where ( y = 10 ), the new total cost ( C(x + y) ) can be calculated using the same cost structure. The equation becomes:[C(x + y) = 100 times 15 + 12(x + y) = 1500 + 12x + 12y]Simplifying this expression gives:[C(x + y) = 1500 + 12x + 120]Which simplifies further to:[C(x + y) = 1620 + 12x]This expression represents the new total cost when considering the additional promotional bonus units."},{"question":"Using the digits 1 through 9 to form three three-digit numbers ( mathbf{a} ), ( mathbf{b} ), and ( mathbf{c} ) (each digit can be used only once), what is the maximum value of ( a + b - c )?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to use the digits 1 through 9 to form three three-digit numbers a, b, and c. Each digit can only be used once. The goal is to find the maximum value of a + b - c. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have to create three numbers, each with three digits, using each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once. Then, I have to compute a + b - c and find the maximum possible value of this expression. So, essentially, I want a and b to be as large as possible, and c to be as small as possible because subtracting a smaller number will give a larger result.That makes sense. So, to maximize a + b - c, I should maximize a and b while minimizing c. Let me break this down.Starting with a and b: to make them as large as possible, I should assign the largest available digits to their hundreds place. The digits 9, 8, and 7 are the largest, so I should use these for the hundreds place of a, b, and c. But wait, since I want a and b to be large, maybe I should assign the two largest digits to a and b, and the next largest to c. Hmm, but c is being subtracted, so if I make c as small as possible, that would help. So perhaps I should assign the smallest digits to c's places.Wait, no, c is a three-digit number, so to make c as small as possible, I should assign the smallest digits to its hundreds, tens, and units places. So, if I use 1, 2, and 3 for c, that would make c the smallest possible. But then, I have to use the remaining digits for a and b. Let's see.But hold on, if I use 1, 2, 3 for c, then the remaining digits are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. I need to form two three-digit numbers a and b from these. To maximize a and b, I should assign the largest remaining digits to their hundreds place. So, 9 and 8 would go to a and b's hundreds place. Then, the next largest digits, 7 and 6, would go to the tens place, and then 5 and 4 to the units place.So, let me try that. Assign 9 and 8 to a and b's hundreds place. Then, 7 and 6 to their tens place, and 5 and 4 to their units place. So, a could be 975 and b could be 864. Then, c would be 321. Let me calculate a + b - c: 975 + 864 = 1839; 1839 - 321 = 1518. Hmm, that's a pretty large number, but is it the maximum?Wait, maybe I can rearrange the digits in a and b to get a higher sum. Let me think. If I switch some digits between a and b, maybe I can get a higher total. For example, if I make a as 964 and b as 875, would that help? Let's see: 964 + 875 = 1839 as well. So, same total. Hmm, so switching the tens and units digits doesn't change the sum because addition is commutative.But maybe if I arrange the digits differently, I can get a higher sum. Wait, but 9 and 8 are already the largest digits, so their placement in the hundreds place is optimal. Then, the next largest digits, 7 and 6, in the tens place, and 5 and 4 in the units place. So, I think that's the maximum sum for a and b.But wait, let me check another possibility. What if I assign 9 and 7 to a and b's hundreds place instead of 9 and 8? Then, c's hundreds place would be 8, which is larger, making c bigger, which is bad because we want c to be as small as possible. So that's worse.Alternatively, if I assign 9 and 8 to a and b, and 7 to c, then c would be 7xx, which is larger than 321. So, definitely, 321 is better for c.Wait, but hold on, if I use 1, 2, 3 for c, that's the smallest possible c. But maybe using 1, 2, 4 would give a slightly larger c, but allow a and b to have slightly larger digits? Hmm, let me think. If I use 1, 2, 4 for c, then c would be 124, which is larger than 123, but wait, 123 is smaller than 124. Wait, actually, 123 is the smallest possible c, right? Because 1 in hundreds, 2 in tens, 3 in units. So, 123 is the smallest possible c.Wait, but if I use 1, 2, 3 for c, then the remaining digits are 4,5,6,7,8,9. So, a and b can be formed from these. So, a and b can be 975 and 864, as I thought earlier. So, a + b is 975 + 864 = 1839, and c is 123, so 1839 - 123 = 1716. Wait, earlier I thought 975 + 864 was 1839, but 1839 - 321 was 1518. Wait, hold on, that can't be right.Wait, no, 975 + 864 is 1839, and 1839 - 123 is 1716. But earlier I thought c was 321, but that was a mistake. Because if c is 123, then a + b - c is 1839 - 123 = 1716, which is higher than 1518. So, my initial mistake was thinking c was 321, but actually, if I use 1,2,3 for c, it's 123, which is much smaller. So, that's a better result.Wait, so maybe I need to correct my earlier calculation. So, if I make c as 123, then a and b can be 975 and 864, giving a + b - c as 1716. Is that the maximum?But wait, maybe I can make a and b even larger by rearranging the digits. Let me see. The digits available for a and b are 4,5,6,7,8,9. So, to make a and b as large as possible, we should assign the largest digits to the hundreds place, then the next largest to the tens, and the smallest to the units.So, for a, hundreds digit is 9, tens is 8, units is 7. For b, hundreds is 6, tens is 5, units is 4. Wait, but that would make a = 987 and b = 654. Then, c would be 321. So, a + b - c would be 987 + 654 - 321.Let me calculate that: 987 + 654 is 1641; 1641 - 321 is 1320. Hmm, that's actually less than 1716. So, that approach gives a lower result.Wait, why is that? Because when I assigned 9 and 8 to a and b's hundreds place, but then used 7 and 6 in the tens place, and 5 and 4 in the units, I got a higher sum for a + b. So, 975 + 864 is 1839, which is higher than 987 + 654 = 1641. So, clearly, the first approach is better.So, perhaps the way to maximize a + b is to have both a and b have high hundreds digits, but also high tens and units digits. So, distributing the high digits across both a and b.Wait, so if I give a the digits 9,7,5 and b the digits 8,6,4, then a is 975 and b is 864, which sum to 1839. Alternatively, if I give a the digits 9,6,4 and b the digits 8,7,5, then a is 964 and b is 875, which also sum to 1839. So, same total.But if I try to make one number as large as possible and the other as large as possible, but maybe not equally, does that help? For example, making a = 986 and b = 754. Then, a + b would be 986 + 754 = 1740, which is less than 1839. So, that's worse.Alternatively, a = 974 and b = 865: 974 + 865 = 1839. Same as before. So, regardless of how I arrange the digits, as long as the hundreds digits are 9 and 8, the tens digits are 7 and 6, and the units digits are 5 and 4, the sum remains the same.So, that seems to be the maximum sum for a + b, given that we're using the digits 4,5,6,7,8,9. So, a + b = 1839, c = 123, so a + b - c = 1839 - 123 = 1716.But wait, is there a way to make c even smaller? Because if c is smaller, then a + b - c would be larger. But c is already 123, which is the smallest possible three-digit number using digits 1,2,3. So, I don't think we can make c any smaller.Wait, but hold on, maybe if we rearrange the digits in c, like 132 or 213, but those are larger than 123. So, 123 is indeed the smallest possible c.Therefore, with c as 123, a and b as 975 and 864, the result is 1716. Is this the maximum?Wait, let me think again. Maybe if I use different digits for c, I can get a higher a + b - c. For example, if I use 1,2,4 for c, making c = 124, then the remaining digits are 3,5,6,7,8,9. Then, a and b can be formed from these. Let's see, the largest possible a and b would be 975 and 863? Wait, but 3 is already used in c? No, wait, c is 124, so digits used are 1,2,4. So, remaining digits are 3,5,6,7,8,9. So, a and b can be 975 and 863? Wait, but 3 is available, so a could be 975 and b could be 863, but 3 is in the units place of b. Alternatively, a = 985 and b = 763. Let's calculate a + b: 985 + 763 = 1748. Then, c is 124, so 1748 - 124 = 1624. That's less than 1716. So, worse.Alternatively, a = 963 and b = 857. 963 + 857 = 1820. 1820 - 124 = 1696. Still less than 1716.Wait, maybe another arrangement. a = 953 and b = 876. 953 + 876 = 1829. 1829 - 124 = 1705. Still less than 1716.So, even if I make c slightly larger, the increase in a + b isn't enough to compensate for the increase in c. So, 1716 is still higher.Alternatively, what if I make c = 132? Then, remaining digits are 4,5,6,7,8,9. Then, a and b can be 987 and 654, which sum to 1641. 1641 - 132 = 1509, which is less than 1716.Alternatively, a = 975 and b = 864, same as before, but c is 132, so 1839 - 132 = 1707, which is still less than 1716.So, seems like 1716 is better.Wait, another thought: what if I don't use the smallest digits for c? Maybe if I use some higher digits for c, but arrange a and b in a way that their sum is significantly higher, such that the increase in a + b outweighs the increase in c.For example, suppose I make c = 142, using digits 1,4,2. Then, remaining digits are 3,5,6,7,8,9. So, a and b can be 987 and 653. 987 + 653 = 1640. 1640 - 142 = 1498. Hmm, that's worse.Alternatively, a = 975 and b = 863, which would be 975 + 863 = 1838. 1838 - 142 = 1696. Still less than 1716.Wait, maybe c = 152, using digits 1,5,2. Then, remaining digits are 3,4,6,7,8,9. So, a and b can be 987 and 654. 987 + 654 = 1641. 1641 - 152 = 1489. Worse.Alternatively, a = 975 and b = 864, which is 1839 - 152 = 1687. Still less than 1716.So, seems like making c larger doesn't help, even if a and b can be slightly larger, because c's increase is too much.Alternatively, what if I make c = 231, which is larger than 123, but then a and b can be formed from 4,5,6,7,8,9. So, a = 987 and b = 654, sum is 1641. 1641 - 231 = 1410. Worse.Alternatively, a = 975 and b = 864, sum 1839. 1839 - 231 = 1608. Still less than 1716.So, no improvement.Wait, another angle: perhaps instead of using 1,2,3 for c, I can use 1,2,4, making c = 124, and then use 3 in a or b. But as I tried earlier, that didn't help.Wait, let me think about the digits. If I use 1,2,3 for c, then a and b get the higher digits, which allows them to be as large as possible. If I give up one of the higher digits for c, then a and b can't be as large, which might not compensate for the smaller c.But in this case, using 1,2,3 for c gives a + b as 1839, which is quite large, and c is 123, so the difference is 1716. If I use a higher digit in c, say 4, then a and b can't use 4, so their digits are 5,6,7,8,9, which is still five digits, but one less. Wait, no, if c uses 1,2,4, then a and b have 3,5,6,7,8,9, which is six digits, same as before. So, a and b can still be formed with six digits, but one of them is 3, which is lower than 4. So, perhaps a and b can still be as high as 975 and 863, but that's a bit lower.Wait, let me calculate: a = 975, b = 863, sum is 975 + 863 = 1838. c = 124. So, 1838 - 124 = 1714. Which is slightly less than 1716.So, 1716 is still better.Wait, another thought: what if I don't use 1,2,3 for c, but instead use 1,3,2? No, that's the same as 123. Or 213, which is larger. So, not helpful.Alternatively, what if I make c a two-digit number? Wait, no, the problem says three three-digit numbers, so c has to be three digits.So, c has to be at least 123, which is the smallest three-digit number using digits 1,2,3.Therefore, I think 1716 is the maximum possible value.But wait, let me just check another possibility. What if I make c = 123, a = 964, and b = 875. Then, a + b = 964 + 875 = 1839. 1839 - 123 = 1716. So, same result.Alternatively, a = 953, b = 876, sum is 1829. 1829 - 123 = 1706. Less than 1716.Wait, another idea: what if I arrange the digits in a and b such that their units digits are as large as possible? Because when adding, the units digits contribute directly to the total. So, maybe having larger units digits can help.Wait, but in the current setup, a = 975 and b = 864, the units digits are 5 and 4, which are the two smallest remaining digits. So, maybe if I swap some digits to have larger units digits, the total sum might increase.Wait, for example, if I make a = 974 and b = 865, then a + b is still 974 + 865 = 1839. So, same total. So, no difference.Alternatively, a = 963 and b = 875, sum is 963 + 875 = 1838. Slightly less.Alternatively, a = 952 and b = 876, sum is 952 + 876 = 1828. Less.So, it seems that regardless of how I arrange the digits, as long as the hundreds digits are 9 and 8, and the tens digits are 7 and 6, the sum remains the same. So, the maximum sum for a + b is 1839, and c is 123, giving a total of 1716.Wait, but let me check another arrangement where a and b have higher digits in the units place. For example, a = 985 and b = 764. Then, a + b = 985 + 764 = 1749. 1749 - 123 = 1626. Less than 1716.Alternatively, a = 984 and b = 765. 984 + 765 = 1749. Same result.So, no improvement.Alternatively, a = 975 and b = 864: 1839 - 123 = 1716.Wait, another thought: what if I don't use 9 and 8 for a and b's hundreds digits, but instead use 9 and 7, and give 8 to c? Then, c would be 8xx, which is larger, but a and b would have 9 and 7 in hundreds place, and maybe higher digits elsewhere.Wait, let's try that. If c is 812, using digits 8,1,2. Then, remaining digits are 3,4,5,6,7,9. So, a and b can be 975 and 643. 975 + 643 = 1618. 1618 - 812 = 806. That's way worse.Alternatively, a = 964 and b = 753. 964 + 753 = 1717. 1717 - 812 = 905. Still worse.Alternatively, a = 953 and b = 764. 953 + 764 = 1717. 1717 - 812 = 905. Same.So, definitely worse.Alternatively, c = 712, using digits 7,1,2. Then, remaining digits are 3,4,5,6,8,9. So, a and b can be 986 and 754. 986 + 754 = 1740. 1740 - 712 = 1028. Still worse than 1716.So, giving a higher digit to c is not beneficial.Wait, another angle: what if I make c as 123, but arrange a and b differently? For example, a = 983 and b = 765. Then, a + b = 983 + 765 = 1748. 1748 - 123 = 1625. Less than 1716.Alternatively, a = 973 and b = 865. 973 + 865 = 1838. 1838 - 123 = 1715. Close, but still less.Alternatively, a = 963 and b = 875. 963 + 875 = 1838. 1838 - 123 = 1715. Same.Wait, so 1716 is still higher.Wait, another thought: what if I use 1,2,3 for c, but arrange a and b such that one of them has a higher digit in the hundreds place, but the other has a slightly lower digit, but overall the sum is higher? For example, a = 982 and b = 765. But wait, 2 is already used in c, so can't use it again. So, no, that's not possible.Alternatively, a = 981 and b = 765. But 1 is used in c, so can't use it again. So, no.Wait, so I think that the initial approach is correct: use 1,2,3 for c, making it 123, and then use the remaining digits to form a and b as 975 and 864, giving a + b - c = 1716.But let me just check another combination where a and b have slightly different digits. For example, a = 962 and b = 875. 962 + 875 = 1837. 1837 - 123 = 1714. Slightly less.Alternatively, a = 952 and b = 876. 952 + 876 = 1828. 1828 - 123 = 1705. Less.Alternatively, a = 942 and b = 876. 942 + 876 = 1818. 1818 - 123 = 1695. Less.So, seems like 1716 is indeed the maximum.Wait, another idea: what if I make c = 123, and then make a = 987 and b = 654. Then, a + b = 987 + 654 = 1641. 1641 - 123 = 1518. Less than 1716.Alternatively, a = 975 and b = 864, which gives 1839 - 123 = 1716.Wait, so 1716 is better.Wait, another thought: what if I don't use 9 and 8 for a and b's hundreds digits, but instead use 9 and 7, and give 8 to c? Then, c would be 812, which is larger, but a and b would have 9 and 7 in hundreds place. Let's see: a = 964, b = 753, c = 812. a + b = 964 + 753 = 1717. 1717 - 812 = 905. Worse.Alternatively, a = 953, b = 764, c = 812. a + b = 953 + 764 = 1717. 1717 - 812 = 905. Same.So, no improvement.Wait, another angle: what if I use 1,2,3 for c, but arrange a and b such that their tens and units digits are as high as possible. For example, a = 985 and b = 764. Then, a + b = 985 + 764 = 1749. 1749 - 123 = 1626. Less than 1716.Alternatively, a = 975 and b = 864, which is 1839 - 123 = 1716.So, again, 1716 is higher.Wait, I think I've tried multiple combinations, and 1716 seems to be the highest I can get. So, maybe that's the answer.But just to be thorough, let me check another arrangement where c is 123, and a and b are 964 and 875. 964 + 875 = 1839. 1839 - 123 = 1716.Alternatively, a = 953 and b = 876. 953 + 876 = 1829. 1829 - 123 = 1706. Less.Wait, another thought: what if I make a = 983 and b = 765, but 3 is already used in c, so can't do that.Alternatively, a = 973 and b = 865. 973 + 865 = 1838. 1838 - 123 = 1715. Close, but still less than 1716.Wait, so 1716 is the maximum.But hold on, let me think about the digits again. If I use 1,2,3 for c, then the remaining digits are 4,5,6,7,8,9. So, a and b can be formed from these. To maximize a + b, I should assign the largest digits to the highest place values.So, for a and b, the hundreds digits should be 9 and 8, the tens digits should be 7 and 6, and the units digits should be 5 and 4. So, a = 975 and b = 864, or a = 964 and b = 875, both give the same sum.So, a + b = 1839, c = 123, so a + b - c = 1716.Therefore, I think 1716 is the maximum value.Wait, just to make sure, let me see if there's any other way to arrange the digits.Suppose I make c = 123, a = 985, and b = 764. Then, a + b = 985 + 764 = 1749. 1749 - 123 = 1626. Less than 1716.Alternatively, a = 975, b = 864, c = 123. 1839 - 123 = 1716.Alternatively, a = 965, b = 874, c = 123. 965 + 874 = 1839. 1839 - 123 = 1716. Same result.Wait, so even if I swap the tens and units digits between a and b, the sum remains the same, so the result is the same.Therefore, I think 1716 is indeed the maximum value of a + b - c.**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( a + b - c ) is boxed{1716}."},{"question":"As a commercial airline pilot transitioning to fly-by-wire (FBW) systems, you are interested in understanding the electrical components involved in these modern systems. The FBW system uses electrical signals to control the aircraft, and understanding the flow of current can be crucial.1. Suppose the resistance ( R ) in a particular circuit component of the FBW system is modeled by the quadratic equation ( R(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 6 ), where ( x ) is a variable related to the temperature in the cockpit in degrees Celsius. Determine the values of ( x ) for which the resistance is exactly 10 ohms. 2. Additionally, consider the linear relationship for the total current ( I ) flowing through the system, given by ( I = 3V + 2 ), where ( V ) represents the voltage. If the voltage ( V ) is increased by 5 volts, determine the new current ( I ).","answer":"Alright, so I've got these two problems to solve related to electrical components in fly-by-wire systems. Let me take them one at a time.Starting with the first problem: We have a quadratic equation modeling resistance, R(x) = 2x² - 8x + 6, and we need to find the values of x where the resistance is exactly 10 ohms. Hmm, okay. So, I think this means I need to set R(x) equal to 10 and solve for x. That makes sense because we're looking for the temperature values where the resistance is 10 ohms.So, let me write that equation down:2x² - 8x + 6 = 10Now, to solve for x, I should bring all terms to one side to form a standard quadratic equation. Subtract 10 from both sides:2x² - 8x + 6 - 10 = 0Simplify that:2x² - 8x - 4 = 0Hmm, okay. So, now I have 2x² - 8x - 4 = 0. I can try to simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 2 to make the numbers smaller, which might make it easier to solve.Dividing each term by 2:x² - 4x - 2 = 0Alright, so now we have x² - 4x - 2 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -4, and c = -2.To solve for x, I can use the quadratic formula, which is:x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)Plugging in the values:x = [-(-4) ± √((-4)² - 4*1*(-2))] / (2*1)Simplify step by step:First, calculate the discriminant, which is the part under the square root:Discriminant = b² - 4ac = (-4)² - 4*1*(-2) = 16 + 8 = 24So, the discriminant is 24. That means we'll have two real solutions because the discriminant is positive.Now, plug that back into the formula:x = [4 ± √24] / 2Simplify √24. I know that √24 can be simplified because 24 = 4*6, and √4 is 2. So, √24 = 2√6.So, substituting back:x = [4 ± 2√6] / 2Now, we can factor out a 2 in the numerator:x = 2[2 ± √6] / 2The 2 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:x = 2 ± √6So, the solutions are x = 2 + √6 and x = 2 - √6.Let me calculate the approximate numerical values to get a sense of what these temperatures are. √6 is approximately 2.449.So, x = 2 + 2.449 ≈ 4.449 degrees Celsius.And x = 2 - 2.449 ≈ -0.449 degrees Celsius.Hmm, negative temperature? That might be a bit odd, but depending on the cockpit conditions, it could be possible. Maybe the model allows for that. So, both solutions are valid in the mathematical sense, but in a real-world scenario, we might have to consider if negative temperatures make sense for the cockpit. But since the problem doesn't specify any constraints, I think both are acceptable.Moving on to the second problem: We have a linear relationship for the total current I, given by I = 3V + 2, where V is the voltage. The question is, if the voltage V is increased by 5 volts, what is the new current I?Okay, so let's parse this. The original current is I = 3V + 2. If V increases by 5 volts, the new voltage is V + 5. So, we can substitute V + 5 into the equation to find the new current.Let me write that down:New I = 3*(V + 5) + 2Let me expand this:New I = 3V + 15 + 2Simplify:New I = 3V + 17Wait, but hold on. The original current was I = 3V + 2. So, the increase in current would be the difference between the new current and the original current.But the question says, \\"determine the new current I.\\" So, if V is increased by 5 volts, the new current is 3*(V + 5) + 2, which simplifies to 3V + 15 + 2 = 3V + 17.Alternatively, if we think in terms of how much the current increases, it's 3*5 = 15 volts increase, so the current increases by 15, making the new current I + 15. But the original current was 3V + 2, so the new current is (3V + 2) + 15 = 3V + 17.Either way, the new current is 3V + 17.Wait, but hold on again. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly.The problem states: \\"If the voltage V is increased by 5 volts, determine the new current I.\\"So, if V becomes V + 5, then I_new = 3*(V + 5) + 2.Yes, that's correct. So, expanding that:I_new = 3V + 15 + 2 = 3V + 17.So, the new current is 3V + 17.Alternatively, if we think about it as an increase, the change in current ΔI is 3*(ΔV) = 3*5 = 15. So, the new current is the original current plus 15, which is (3V + 2) + 15 = 3V + 17.Either approach gives the same result, so that seems consistent.Therefore, the new current is 3V + 17.Wait, but hold on. Is the question asking for the new current in terms of V, or is it asking for the increase in current? Let me check the wording again.\\"If the voltage V is increased by 5 volts, determine the new current I.\\"So, it's asking for the new current, not the change in current. So, yes, it's 3V + 17.But let me think again. If V is increased by 5, then the new current is 3*(V + 5) + 2, which is 3V + 15 + 2 = 3V + 17. So, that's correct.Alternatively, if we express it as a function, I_new = 3V + 17. So, that's the answer.Wait, but maybe the question is expecting a numerical value? Hmm, but we don't have a specific value for V. It just says V is increased by 5 volts. So, unless we're supposed to express the new current in terms of the original current, but the original current is 3V + 2. So, the new current is 3V + 17, which is 15 more than the original current.But since the question is asking for the new current, and not the change, I think 3V + 17 is the answer.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I misread the question. It says, \\"the total current I flowing through the system, given by I = 3V + 2.\\" So, if V is increased by 5 volts, what is the new I? So, yes, it's 3*(V + 5) + 2 = 3V + 15 + 2 = 3V + 17.Alternatively, if we consider that the original I was 3V + 2, then increasing V by 5 would make the new I = 3*(V + 5) + 2 = 3V + 15 + 2 = 3V + 17. So, that's correct.Alternatively, if we think in terms of the original current, I = 3V + 2, then the new current is I + 15, because ΔI = 3*ΔV = 3*5 = 15. So, new I = I + 15 = (3V + 2) + 15 = 3V + 17. Same result.So, either way, the new current is 3V + 17.Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating this. The question is straightforward: If V is increased by 5 volts, what is the new current? So, substituting V + 5 into the equation I = 3V + 2 gives I = 3*(V + 5) + 2 = 3V + 15 + 2 = 3V + 17. So, that's the new current.Yes, that seems correct.So, to recap:Problem 1: Solve 2x² - 8x + 6 = 10, which simplifies to x² - 4x - 2 = 0, leading to x = 2 ± √6.Problem 2: If V increases by 5, new I = 3*(V + 5) + 2 = 3V + 17.I think that covers both problems. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.For problem 1:Original equation: 2x² - 8x + 6 = 10Subtract 10: 2x² - 8x - 4 = 0Divide by 2: x² - 4x - 2 = 0Quadratic formula: x = [4 ± √(16 + 8)] / 2 = [4 ± √24]/2 = [4 ± 2√6]/2 = 2 ± √6. Correct.Problem 2:I = 3V + 2V increases by 5: V_new = V + 5I_new = 3*(V + 5) + 2 = 3V + 15 + 2 = 3V + 17. Correct.Yes, everything checks out."},{"question":"There is a magical flower that blooms on Wednesdays and Fridays in odd-numbered months and on Tuesdays and Thursdays in even-numbered months.

The firefighters there decide to teach the child some interesting math using the fire station's daily operations.1. The fire station has a particular schedule for its vehicles. The number of fire trucks (T) and ambulances (A) leaving the station satisfies the equation (2T + 3A = 12). On a certain day, the total number of vehicles (fire trucks and ambulances) that leave the station is 5. Set up a system of linear equations based on this information and solve for the number of fire trucks and ambulances that left the station.2. The firefighters also have a special hose that can extend to a length given by the polynomial (L(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24), where (x) represents the number of segments added to the hose. They want to find out the values of (x) for which the length of the hose is zero. Solve the polynomial equation (L(x) = 0) to determine these values.","answer":"Okay, so I've got two math problems here that the firefighters are teaching a young child. Let me try to figure them out step by step. I'll start with the first one.**Problem 1: Fire Trucks and Ambulances**Alright, the fire station has a schedule where the number of fire trucks (T) and ambulances (A) leaving the station satisfies the equation (2T + 3A = 12). On a certain day, the total number of vehicles is 5. I need to set up a system of linear equations and solve for T and A.First, let's write down what we know.We have two equations:1. The total number of vehicles: (T + A = 5)2. The equation given: (2T + 3A = 12)So, the system of equations is:1. (T + A = 5)2. (2T + 3A = 12)I need to solve this system. I can use substitution or elimination. Let me try substitution because the first equation is simple.From the first equation, I can express T in terms of A:(T = 5 - A)Now, substitute this into the second equation:(2(5 - A) + 3A = 12)Let me expand this:(10 - 2A + 3A = 12)Combine like terms:(10 + A = 12)Subtract 10 from both sides:(A = 2)Now, plug this back into the expression for T:(T = 5 - 2 = 3)So, the number of fire trucks is 3 and ambulances is 2.Wait, let me double-check to make sure these numbers satisfy both equations.First equation: (3 + 2 = 5). That's correct.Second equation: (2*3 + 3*2 = 6 + 6 = 12). That also checks out.Okay, so that seems right.**Problem 2: Solving the Polynomial Equation**The second problem is about a special hose whose length is given by the polynomial (L(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24). We need to find the values of x for which the length is zero, so solve (L(x) = 0).Hmm, solving a cubic equation. I remember that for polynomials, we can try to factor them or use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible roots.Let me write down the equation:(x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24 = 0)First, let's try the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient.The constant term is -24, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±24.Let me test these one by one.Start with x=1:(1 - 4 + 6 - 24 = (1 - 4) + (6 - 24) = (-3) + (-18) = -21 ≠ 0)Not a root.x=2:(8 - 16 + 12 - 24 = (8 - 16) + (12 - 24) = (-8) + (-12) = -20 ≠ 0)Not a root.x=3:(27 - 36 + 18 - 24 = (27 - 36) + (18 - 24) = (-9) + (-6) = -15 ≠ 0)Still not a root.x=4:(64 - 64 + 24 - 24 = (64 - 64) + (24 - 24) = 0 + 0 = 0)Oh, x=4 is a root!Great, so (x - 4) is a factor. Now, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 4) from the cubic polynomial.Let me use synthetic division with x=4.Set up the coefficients: 1 (x³), -4 (x²), 6 (x), -24 (constant).Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by 4: 4. Add to next coefficient: -4 + 4 = 0.Multiply 0 by 4: 0. Add to next coefficient: 6 + 0 = 6.Multiply 6 by 4: 24. Add to last coefficient: -24 + 24 = 0.So, the result is 1x² + 0x + 6, which is x² + 6.Therefore, the polynomial factors as:((x - 4)(x² + 6) = 0)So, the solutions are x = 4 and the solutions to x² + 6 = 0.Solving x² + 6 = 0:x² = -6x = ±√(-6) = ±i√6So, the real solution is x=4, and the other two solutions are complex numbers.But since x represents the number of segments added to the hose, it must be a real number, and likely a positive integer. So, the only meaningful solution here is x=4.Wait, let me think again. The problem says \\"the values of x for which the length of the hose is zero.\\" It doesn't specify if x has to be a positive integer or if it can be any real number. But in the context, x is the number of segments, so it should be a positive integer. So, x=4 is the only valid solution.But just to be thorough, let me check if x=4 is indeed a root.Plugging x=4 into L(x):(4³ - 4*(4²) + 6*4 -24 = 64 - 64 + 24 -24 = 0). Yep, that's correct.So, the only real solution is x=4.Wait, but the polynomial is cubic, so it should have three roots, right? But in this case, one real and two complex roots.So, summarizing, the solutions are x=4, x= i√6, and x= -i√6.But since x is the number of segments, which can't be negative or imaginary, only x=4 is the valid solution.Therefore, the value of x is 4.**Final Answer**1. The number of fire trucks is boxed{3} and the number of ambulances is boxed{2}.2. The value of (x) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Jim spends 8 hours scuba diving.  In that time he finds a treasure chest with 100 gold coins in it.  He also finds 2 smaller bags that have half as much gold each.  How much gold does he find per hour?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total amount of gold Jim found. He found a treasure chest with 100 gold coins and two smaller bags, each containing half as much gold as the chest. Each smaller bag has 100 divided by 2, which is 50 gold coins. Since there are two smaller bags, together they contain 50 multiplied by 2, equaling 100 gold coins.Adding the gold from the chest and the smaller bags gives a total of 100 plus 100, which is 200 gold coins.Jim spent 8 hours scuba diving. To find out how much gold he found per hour, I divide the total gold by the number of hours: 200 divided by 8 equals 25.Therefore, Jim found 25 gold coins per hour."},{"question":"As a watchful citizen of Alaska's Mat-Su Valley, you are interested in analyzing the growth of health-related services in your community. You observe that a new health clinic opens every year, and the number of patients each clinic serves can be modeled by the polynomial function ( P(n) = 20n^2 + 150n + 300 ), where ( n ) represents the number of years since the first clinic opened.1. Determine the number of patients served by the clinics in the 5th year after the first clinic opened.2. You also notice that when the number of patients served by a clinic reaches 2000, the clinic needs to expand. Use the inequality ( 20n^2 + 150n + 300 geq 2000 ) to find the smallest number of years ( n ) after which a clinic will need to expand.","answer":"To determine the number of patients served in the 5th year, I'll substitute ( n = 5 ) into the polynomial function ( P(n) = 20n^2 + 150n + 300 ).First, calculate ( 5^2 ) which is 25. Then multiply by 20 to get 500. Next, multiply 150 by 5 to get 750. Finally, add 300. Adding these together: 500 + 750 + 300 equals 1550. So, the clinics serve 1550 patients in the 5th year.For the second part, I need to find the smallest ( n ) such that ( 20n^2 + 150n + 300 geq 2000 ). I'll start by setting up the inequality:( 20n^2 + 150n + 300 geq 2000 )Subtracting 2000 from both sides gives:( 20n^2 + 150n - 1700 geq 0 )Dividing the entire equation by 10 simplifies it to:( 2n^2 + 15n - 170 geq 0 )Using the quadratic formula ( n = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) with ( a = 2 ), ( b = 15 ), and ( c = -170 ):Calculate the discriminant:( b^2 - 4ac = 225 + 1360 = 1585 )Then find the roots:( n = frac{-15 pm sqrt{1585}}{4} )Approximating the square root of 1585 gives about 39.81. So,( n = frac{-15 + 39.81}{4} approx 6.2 ) and ( n = frac{-15 - 39.81}{4} ) (which is negative and not applicable).Since ( n ) must be a whole number, the smallest integer greater than 6.2 is 7. Therefore, the clinics will need to expand after 7 years."},{"question":"Given f(x) is an odd function, and when x < 0, f(x) = x^2 + 3x, then f(2) =  .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that f(x) is an odd function, and when x is less than 0, f(x) is equal to x squared plus 3x. Then I need to find f(2). Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.First, I remember that an odd function has a specific property. I think it's something like f(-x) equals negative f(x). Let me confirm that. Yeah, that's right. For any odd function, f(-x) = -f(x). So that means if I know the value of the function at a negative point, I can find the value at the corresponding positive point by just taking the negative of it. That seems useful because in this problem, I know f(x) when x is negative, but I need to find f(2), which is when x is positive.So, let's break it down. I need to find f(2). Since 2 is positive, I can't directly use the given expression for f(x) when x is negative. But since f(x) is odd, I can relate f(2) to f(-2). Specifically, f(2) should be equal to -f(-2). That makes sense because f(-2) is the value at a negative x, which I can compute using the given formula, and then I just take the negative of that to get f(2).Alright, so let's compute f(-2). The problem says that when x is less than 0, f(x) is x squared plus 3x. So, substituting x = -2 into that expression, we get f(-2) = (-2)^2 + 3*(-2). Let me calculate that. (-2)^2 is 4, and 3*(-2) is -6. So, adding those together, 4 + (-6) is -2. Therefore, f(-2) equals -2.Now, since f(x) is odd, f(2) should be equal to -f(-2). So, plugging in the value we just found, f(2) = -(-2). That simplifies to 2. So, f(2) equals 2.Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, f(-2) is (-2)^2 + 3*(-2). (-2)^2 is 4, 3*(-2) is -6, so 4 - 6 is indeed -2. Then, f(2) is -f(-2), which is -(-2) = 2. Yeah, that seems right.Just to make sure I understand why this works, let me recall the definition of an odd function. An odd function is symmetric about the origin, meaning if you rotate the graph 180 degrees around the origin, it looks the same. So, for every point (x, y) on the graph, there is a corresponding point (-x, -y). That's exactly what we used here: knowing the value at x = -2 gives us the value at x = 2 by reflecting through the origin.Another thing I might consider is whether f(x) is defined correctly for all x. The problem only gives me f(x) for x < 0, but since it's an odd function, we can extend it to x > 0 by using the property f(x) = -f(-x). So, for x > 0, f(x) is just the negative of f evaluated at -x, which is in the region where we have the explicit formula.Let me write that out more formally. For x > 0, f(x) = -f(-x). Since -x is negative when x is positive, we can substitute into the given formula: f(-x) = (-x)^2 + 3*(-x). Simplifying that, (-x)^2 is x squared, and 3*(-x) is -3x. So, f(-x) = x^2 - 3x. Therefore, f(x) = -f(-x) = -(x^2 - 3x) = -x^2 + 3x.So, for x > 0, f(x) is equal to -x squared plus 3x. Therefore, plugging in x = 2, f(2) = -(2)^2 + 3*(2). Calculating that, -(4) + 6 is -4 + 6, which is 2. So, that's another way to get the same result, which is reassuring.Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me go through the steps again. For x = 2, which is positive, f(2) is equal to -f(-2). f(-2) is (-2)^2 + 3*(-2). (-2)^2 is 4, 3*(-2) is -6. So, 4 - 6 is -2. Therefore, f(2) is -(-2) which is 2. Yep, that's consistent.I also remember that for odd functions, if you integrate them over symmetric limits around zero, the integral is zero. But I don't think that's relevant here, but just thinking about the properties to make sure I'm on the right track.Another property is that the graph of an odd function passes through the origin if it's defined there. So, f(0) should be zero. Let me check that with the given function. If I plug x = 0 into the expression for x < 0, f(0) would be 0^2 + 3*0 = 0. So, that's consistent with f(0) being zero, which is a property of odd functions. So, that's another check that everything is consistent.Wait, hold on a second. The function is defined as x^2 + 3x for x < 0. But at x = 0, if we plug into that expression, we get 0. But since f(x) is odd, f(0) must be 0, which matches. So, that's good. So, the function is continuous at zero as well, I think. Because the limit from the left as x approaches 0 would be 0, and the limit from the right, since f(x) is defined as -x^2 + 3x for x > 0, plugging in x = 0 would also give 0. So, the function is continuous at x = 0.But in this problem, we're only concerned with f(2), so maybe that's more than I need to think about, but it's good to verify that the function is properly defined.So, just to recap, since f is odd, f(2) = -f(-2). f(-2) is (-2)^2 + 3*(-2) = 4 - 6 = -2. Therefore, f(2) = -(-2) = 2. So, the answer is 2.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and I've double-checked the calculations. So, I feel confident that f(2) is indeed 2.**Final Answer**The value of ( f(2) ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"As an ex-MMA fighter-turned-personal-trainer, you are designing a fitness program that involves both strength training and cardio exercises to maximize muscle gain and fat loss. You know from your experience that the number of calories burned per session (C) depends on the number of minutes spent on strength training (x) and cardio exercises (y). The relationship is modeled by the polynomial equation:[ C = 5x^2 + 10y - xy ]1. If you want to burn exactly 600 calories in one session, set up the equation with the given calorie target and find the possible combinations of strength training and cardio minutes (x and y) that satisfy this condition. Assume that both x and y must be positive integers.2. One of your clients can only spend a maximum of 90 minutes per session on both exercises combined. Set up an inequality to represent this time constraint and find the range of values for x and y that satisfy both the calorie target and the time constraint.","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to help design a fitness program that combines strength training and cardio to maximize muscle gain and fat loss. The calories burned per session are given by the equation C = 5x² + 10y - xy, where x is the minutes spent on strength training and y is the minutes on cardio. First, I need to figure out the combinations of x and y that will burn exactly 600 calories. So, I set up the equation:5x² + 10y - xy = 600.Hmm, this looks like a quadratic equation with two variables. Since both x and y have to be positive integers, I need to find integer solutions for this equation. Maybe I can rearrange the equation to solve for y in terms of x or vice versa. Let me try solving for y.Starting with 5x² + 10y - xy = 600, I can factor out y from the terms that have it:5x² + y(10 - x) = 600.Now, let's isolate y:y(10 - x) = 600 - 5x².So, y = (600 - 5x²) / (10 - x).Hmm, that simplifies to y = [5(120 - x²)] / (10 - x). Wait, maybe I can factor the numerator differently. Let me see:600 - 5x² = 5(120 - x²). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator as 5(120 - x²) and see if 10 - x is a factor.But 120 - x² doesn't factor nicely with 10 - x. Maybe I can perform polynomial division or factor the numerator in a way that 10 - x is a factor.Let me try to factor 600 - 5x². Let's factor out a -5:600 - 5x² = -5(x² - 120).Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I can factor the equation differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can write y as:y = (600 - 5x²) / (10 - x).I can factor out a 5 in the numerator:y = 5(120 - x²) / (10 - x).Now, let's see if 10 - x is a factor of 120 - x². Let's try to factor 120 - x². Hmm, 120 is 10*12, but x² - 120 isn't a difference of squares. Alternatively, maybe I can factor 120 - x² as (something)(something else). Wait, perhaps I can write it as (10 - x)(something) + something.Alternatively, maybe I can perform polynomial division on 120 - x² divided by 10 - x.Let me set it up:Divide x² - 120 by x - 10 (since 10 - x = -(x - 10)).Using polynomial long division:x² - 120 divided by x - 10.First term: x² / x = x. Multiply (x - 10) by x: x² - 10x.Subtract from x² - 120: (x² - 120) - (x² - 10x) = 10x - 120.Now, divide 10x by x: 10. Multiply (x - 10) by 10: 10x - 100.Subtract: (10x - 120) - (10x - 100) = -20.So, x² - 120 = (x - 10)(x + 10) - 20. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, the division gives:x² - 120 = (x - 10)(x + 10) + (-20).Wait, no, that's not correct because (x - 10)(x + 10) = x² - 100, so x² - 120 = (x - 10)(x + 10) - 20.So, 120 - x² = -(x² - 120) = -(x - 10)(x + 10) + 20.Therefore, y = 5(120 - x²)/(10 - x) = 5[-(x - 10)(x + 10) + 20]/(10 - x).Simplify numerator:= 5[-(x - 10)(x + 10) + 20]/(10 - x)= 5[-(x - 10)(x + 10) + 20]/(10 - x)Notice that 10 - x = -(x - 10), so:= 5[-(x - 10)(x + 10) + 20]/[-(x - 10)]= 5[(x - 10)(x + 10) - 20]/(x - 10)Now, split the fraction:= 5[(x - 10)(x + 10)/(x - 10) - 20/(x - 10)]= 5[(x + 10) - 20/(x - 10)]So, y = 5(x + 10) - 100/(x - 10)Hmm, that's interesting. So y is expressed in terms of x, but we have this term 100/(x - 10). Since y must be an integer, 100/(x - 10) must be an integer. Therefore, (x - 10) must be a divisor of 100.So, x - 10 divides 100. Let's list all positive divisors of 100, since x must be greater than 10 (because x - 10 must be positive to make y positive, as y = 5(x + 10) - 100/(x - 10) must be positive).Wait, actually, x - 10 could be positive or negative, but since x and y are positive integers, let's see:If x - 10 is positive, then x > 10.If x - 10 is negative, then x < 10, but let's see if that's possible.Let me consider both cases.Case 1: x - 10 > 0, so x > 10.Then, x - 10 is a positive divisor of 100. The positive divisors of 100 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.So, x - 10 can be 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.Thus, x can be 11, 12, 14, 15, 20, 30, 35, 60, 110.Now, let's compute y for each x:For x = 11:y = 5(11 + 10) - 100/(11 - 10) = 5*21 - 100/1 = 105 - 100 = 5.Check if y is positive: yes, 5.For x = 12:y = 5(12 + 10) - 100/(12 - 10) = 5*22 - 100/2 = 110 - 50 = 60.y = 60.For x = 14:y = 5(14 + 10) - 100/(14 - 10) = 5*24 - 100/4 = 120 - 25 = 95.y = 95.For x = 15:y = 5(15 + 10) - 100/(15 - 10) = 5*25 - 100/5 = 125 - 20 = 105.y = 105.For x = 20:y = 5(20 + 10) - 100/(20 - 10) = 5*30 - 100/10 = 150 - 10 = 140.y = 140.For x = 30:y = 5(30 + 10) - 100/(30 - 10) = 5*40 - 100/20 = 200 - 5 = 195.y = 195.For x = 35:y = 5(35 + 10) - 100/(35 - 10) = 5*45 - 100/25 = 225 - 4 = 221.y = 221.For x = 60:y = 5(60 + 10) - 100/(60 - 10) = 5*70 - 100/50 = 350 - 2 = 348.y = 348.For x = 110:y = 5(110 + 10) - 100/(110 - 10) = 5*120 - 100/100 = 600 - 1 = 599.y = 599.Now, let's check if these x and y values satisfy the original equation:Take x=11, y=5:C = 5*(11)^2 + 10*5 - 11*5 = 5*121 + 50 - 55 = 605 + 50 -55 = 600.

Correct.x=60, y=348:C=5*3600 +3480 -20880=18000+3480-20880=21480-20880=600. Correct.x=110, y=599:C=5*12100 +5990 -65890=60500+5990-65890=66490-65890=600. Correct.So all these combinations work.Now, let's consider Case 2: x - 10 < 0, so x < 10.Then, x - 10 is a negative divisor of 100. The negative divisors of 100 are: -1, -2, -4, -5, -10, -20, -25, -50, -100.So, x - 10 can be -1, -2, -4, -5, -10, -20, -25, -50, -100.Thus, x can be 9, 8, 6, 5, 0, -10, -15, -40, -90.But x must be a positive integer, so x can be 9, 8, 6, 5.Let's compute y for these x values:For x=9:y = 5(9 + 10) - 100/(9 - 10) = 5*19 - 100/(-1) = 95 + 100 = 195.y=195.Check if y is positive: yes.For x=8:y =5(8 +10) -100/(8-10)=5*18 -100/(-2)=90 +50=140.y=140.For x=6:y=5(6+10)-100/(6-10)=5*16 -100/(-4)=80 +25=105.y=105.For x=5:y=5(5+10)-100/(5-10)=5*15 -100/(-5)=75 +20=95.y=95.Now, let's check if these satisfy the original equation:x=9, y=195:C=5*81 +10*195 -9*195=405 +1950 -1755=2355-1755=600. Correct.x=8, y=140:C=5*64 +1400 -1120=320+1400-1120=1720-1120=600. Correct.x=6, y=105:C=5*36 +1050 -630=180+1050-630=1230-630=600. Correct.x=5, y=95:C=5*25 +950 -475=125+950-475=1075-475=600. Correct.So, these also work.So, compiling all possible positive integer solutions:From x >10:(11,5), (12,60), (14,95), (15,105), (20,140), (30,195), (35,221), (60,348), (110,599).From x <10:(5,95), (6,105), (8,140), (9,195).Wait, but when x=5, y=95; x=6, y=105; x=8, y=140; x=9, y=195.So, these are all valid.Now, moving on to part 2: the client can only spend a maximum of 90 minutes per session. So, x + y ≤ 90.We need to find the range of x and y that satisfy both C=600 and x + y ≤90.So, we have two conditions:1. 5x² +10y -xy =600.2. x + y ≤90.We need to find all (x,y) pairs that satisfy both.From part 1, we have all possible (x,y) pairs that satisfy C=600. Now, we need to check which of these pairs also satisfy x + y ≤90.Let's list all the pairs from part 1 and check x + y:From x >10:(11,5): 11+5=16 ≤90: yes.(12,60):12+60=72 ≤90: yes.(14,95):14+95=109 >90: no.(15,105):15+105=120>90: no.(20,140):20+140=160>90: no.(30,195):30+195=225>90: no.(35,221):35+221=256>90: no.(60,348):60+348=408>90: no.(110,599):110+599=709>90: no.From x <10:(5,95):5+95=100>90: no.(6,105):6+105=111>90: no.(8,140):8+140=148>90: no.(9,195):9+195=204>90: no.So, only the pairs (11,5) and (12,60) satisfy x + y ≤90.Wait, let me double-check:For (11,5):11+5=16 ≤90: yes.For (12,60):12+60=72 ≤90: yes.All others have x + y exceeding 90.Therefore, the possible combinations are (11,5) and (12,60).But wait, let's make sure there are no other solutions. Since we've considered all possible divisors, these are the only ones.So, the answer for part 1 is all the pairs listed, and for part 2, only (11,5) and (12,60)."},{"question":"A prism has 9 faces, then it has ______ vertices.","answer":"To determine the number of vertices in a prism with 9 faces, I start by recalling the formula for the number of faces in a prism.

To ensure the curriculum is both challenging and engaging, the supervisor designs the following problem:1. Consider the polynomial equation ( P(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 ). As a part of the curriculum, solve for all possible values of ( x ) by factoring the polynomial equation completely.2. To further test the students' understanding of inequalities, the supervisor challenges them to determine the solution set for the inequality ( frac{P(x)}{x - 2} > 0 ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and it's about polynomials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem is divided into two parts. The first part is to solve the polynomial equation ( P(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 ) by factoring it completely. The second part is to determine the solution set for the inequality ( frac{P(x)}{x - 2} > 0 ).Starting with the first part: factoring the polynomial. I remember that for cubic polynomials, one common method is to try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction ( frac{p}{q} ), has a numerator ( p ) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator ( q ) that is a factor of the leading coefficient.Looking at ( P(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ), the constant term is -6, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are the factors of -6 divided by 1, which are ( pm1, pm2, pm3, pm6 ).I can test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial. Let me start with x=1:( P(1) = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0 ). Oh, that works! So, x=1 is a root. That means (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial.Now, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 1) from the polynomial. Let me try synthetic division because it's usually quicker.Setting up synthetic division with root 1:1 | 1  -6  11  -6I bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by 1, get 1. Add to -6: -5.Multiply 1 by -5, get -5. Add to 11: 6.Multiply 1 by 6, get 6. Add to -6: 0. Perfect, no remainder.So, after factoring out (x - 1), the polynomial becomes ( (x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6) ).Now, I need to factor the quadratic ( x^2 - 5x + 6 ). Let me see, I need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. Hmm, -2 and -3. Yes, because (-2)*(-3)=6 and (-2)+(-3)=-5.So, the quadratic factors into ( (x - 2)(x - 3) ). Therefore, the complete factorization of P(x) is ( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) ).So, the roots are x=1, x=2, and x=3. That should answer the first part.Moving on to the second part: solving the inequality ( frac{P(x)}{x - 2} > 0 ). Since we already factored P(x), we can substitute that in:( frac{(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)}{x - 2} > 0 ).Wait, I notice that (x - 2) is in both the numerator and the denominator. So, can I cancel them out? Hmm, but I have to be careful because when x=2, the denominator becomes zero, which is undefined. So, x=2 cannot be part of the solution set.So, simplifying the expression, for x ≠ 2, the inequality becomes ( (x - 1)(x - 3) > 0 ).Now, I need to solve ( (x - 1)(x - 3) > 0 ). To do this, I can find the critical points where each factor is zero, which are x=1 and x=3. These points divide the real number line into intervals. I can test each interval to see where the product is positive.The critical points are 1 and 3, so the intervals are:1. ( (-infty, 1) )2. ( (1, 3) )3. ( (3, infty) )I'll pick test points in each interval:1. For ( (-infty, 1) ), let's choose x=0:   ( (0 - 1)(0 - 3) = (-1)(-3) = 3 > 0 ). So, this interval is part of the solution.2. For ( (1, 3) ), let's choose x=2:   ( (2 - 1)(2 - 3) = (1)(-1) = -1 < 0 ). So, this interval is not part of the solution.3. For ( (3, infty) ), let's choose x=4:   ( (4 - 1)(4 - 3) = (3)(1) = 3 > 0 ). So, this interval is part of the solution.Additionally, I need to consider the points where the expression is zero or undefined. The expression is zero when x=1 or x=3, but since the inequality is strict (> 0), these points are not included. Also, x=2 makes the original expression undefined, so it's excluded as well.Putting it all together, the solution set is ( (-infty, 1) cup (3, infty) ).Wait, hold on. Let me double-check if I considered the original inequality correctly. The original inequality was ( frac{P(x)}{x - 2} > 0 ), which simplifies to ( (x - 1)(x - 3) > 0 ) for x ≠ 2. So, yes, the critical points are 1 and 3, and the intervals are as above.But just to be thorough, let me also consider the behavior around x=2. Since x=2 is excluded, we don't include it in the solution. So, the solution is indeed ( (-infty, 1) cup (3, infty) ).I think that's it. So, summarizing:1. The roots of the polynomial are x=1, x=2, and x=3.2. The solution set for the inequality is all real numbers less than 1 and greater than 3, excluding x=2.**Final Answer**1. The solutions to the equation are (boxed{1}), (boxed{2}), and (boxed{3}).2. The solution set for the inequality is (boxed{(-infty, 1) cup (3, infty)})."},{"question":"If nonzero vectors boldsymbol{alpha} and boldsymbol{beta} satisfy |boldsymbol{alpha}+boldsymbol{beta}|=|boldsymbol{alpha}-boldsymbol{beta}|, then the angle between boldsymbol{alpha} and boldsymbol{beta} is","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If nonzero vectors α and β satisfy |α + β| = |α - β|, then what is the angle between α and β? Hmm, interesting. I remember that when dealing with vectors, the magnitude of the sum or difference can be related to the angle between them. Let me try to recall the formula for the magnitude of a vector sum.I think it's something like |α + β|² = |α|² + |β|² + 2α·β, right? And similarly, |α - β|² = |α|² + |β|² - 2α·β. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, if |α + β| equals |α - β|, then their squares should also be equal. Let me write that down.So, |α + β|² = |α - β|².Substituting the formulas I remember, that gives:|α|² + |β|² + 2α·β = |α|² + |β|² - 2α·β.Hmm, okay, let me subtract |α|² + |β|² from both sides to simplify. That would leave:2α·β = -2α·β.Wait, so 2α·β + 2α·β = 0, which simplifies to 4α·β = 0. So, α·β = 0.Oh, so the dot product of α and β is zero. That means the vectors are orthogonal, right? Because the dot product being zero implies that the angle between them is 90 degrees. So, the angle between α and β is π/2 radians or 90 degrees.But let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from |α + β| = |α - β|, squaring both sides gives |α + β|² = |α - β|². Then expanding both sides using the formula for the magnitude squared of vector sums and differences, which is |a ± b|² = |a|² + |b|² ± 2a·b.So, plugging that in, I get |α|² + |β|² + 2α·β = |α|² + |β|² - 2α·β. Subtracting |α|² + |β|² from both sides, it's 2α·β = -2α·β, which leads to 4α·β = 0, so α·β = 0. Yep, that seems correct.Another way to think about it is geometrically. If the lengths of α + β and α - β are equal, then the vectors α and β must form a parallelogram where the diagonals are equal in length. I remember that in a parallelogram, if the diagonals are equal, it's a rectangle. So, the sides must be perpendicular to each other. That also suggests that α and β are perpendicular.Let me visualize this. Imagine vectors α and β emanating from the same point. If you add them, you get one diagonal, and if you subtract them, you get the other diagonal. If both diagonals are the same length, the figure must be a rectangle, meaning the vectors are at right angles. So, that reinforces the conclusion that the angle between them is 90 degrees.I guess another way to see it is by using the cosine formula for the angle between two vectors. The dot product α·β is equal to |α||β|cosθ, where θ is the angle between them. Since we found that α·β = 0, that means |α||β|cosθ = 0. Since α and β are nonzero vectors, their magnitudes |α| and |β| are not zero. Therefore, cosθ must be zero, which implies θ is 90 degrees because cosine of 90 degrees is zero.So, putting it all together, whether I approach it algebraically by expanding the magnitudes, geometrically by considering the parallelogram, or using the dot product formula, I consistently arrive at the conclusion that the angle between α and β is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle is π/2 radians.I don't think I made any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step follows logically, and the multiple approaches all lead to the same conclusion. So, I feel confident that the angle is indeed 90 degrees.**Final Answer**The angle between α and β is boxed{dfrac{pi}{2}}."},{"question":"As a supportive partner managing the Nobel laureate's schedule, you need to allocate time for various daily tasks while ensuring the laureate has enough time to rest and prepare for an upcoming event.

There are four activities: research (R), rest (T), meetings (M), and personal time (P). The total time in a day is 16 hours. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I need to write a system of inequalities based on the given conditions. Let me list out the conditions:1. The total time spent on all activities is 16 hours. So, R + T + M + P = 16.2. The time spent on research should be twice the time spent in meetings. So, R = 2M.3. The laureate must rest for at least 4 hours. So, T ≥ 4.4. Personal time should be at least half the time spent on research. So, P ≥ (1/2)R.Also, all variables R, T, M, P must be non-negative because you can't spend negative time on an activity. So, R ≥ 0, T ≥ 0, M ≥ 0, P ≥ 0.Now, let me translate these into inequalities:1. R + T + M + P = 16. Since it's an equation, it's already fixed.2. R = 2M. So, R - 2M = 0.3. T ≥ 4.4. P ≥ (1/2)R.And the non-negativity constraints:R ≥ 0, T ≥ 0, M ≥ 0, P ≥ 0.But since T must be at least 4, we can adjust that to T ≥ 4.So, summarizing the system:1. R + T + M + P = 162. R = 2M3. T ≥ 44. P ≥ (1/2)R5. R, T, M, P ≥ 0Now, I need to find a possible set of values for R, T, M, and P that satisfy all these conditions.Let me see. Since R = 2M, I can express R in terms of M. Let me substitute R = 2M into the total time equation.So, substituting into equation 1:2M + T + M + P = 16Simplify:3M + T + P = 16We also have P ≥ (1/2)R, which is P ≥ (1/2)(2M) = M.So, P ≥ M.Additionally, T ≥ 4.So, let me try to express everything in terms of M and T.From 3M + T + P = 16, and P ≥ M, we can write P = M + k, where k ≥ 0.So, substituting P = M + k into the equation:3M + T + (M + k) = 16Simplify:4M + T + k = 16Since k ≥ 0, we can say that 4M + T ≤ 16.But T must be at least 4, so T ≥ 4.So, 4M + T ≤ 16 and T ≥ 4.Let me solve for M in terms of T:4M ≤ 16 - TSo, M ≤ (16 - T)/4Since T ≥ 4, the maximum value of T is 16 - 4M, but T can't exceed 16 because all other variables are non-negative. But since T must be at least 4, let's see.Wait, maybe it's better to pick a value for T and then find M, R, and P accordingly.Let me choose T = 4, the minimum required rest time. Then, 4M + 4 + k = 16So, 4M + k = 12Since k ≥ 0, M can be at most 3 (if k = 0). Let's choose M = 3.Then, R = 2M = 6P = M + k = 3 + kFrom 4M + k = 12, with M = 3, 12 + k = 12, so k = 0. Therefore, P = 3.So, let me check:R = 6, T = 4, M = 3, P = 3.Total time: 6 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 16. Good.Check other conditions:R = 2M: 6 = 2*3. Yes.T ≥ 4: 4 = 4. Yes.P ≥ (1/2)R: 3 ≥ 3. Yes.All variables are non-negative. Perfect.Alternatively, if I choose T = 5, then 4M + 5 + k = 16So, 4M + k = 11Let me choose M = 2, then k = 11 - 8 = 3So, P = M + k = 2 + 3 = 5Then, R = 2M = 4So, R = 4, T = 5, M = 2, P = 5Check total: 4 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 16. Good.Check other conditions:R = 2M: 4 = 4. Yes.T ≥ 4: 5 ≥ 4. Yes.P ≥ (1/2)R: 5 ≥ 2. Yes.Another valid set.But the first set with T = 4 is also valid.So, for part 1, one possible set is R = 6, T = 4, M = 3, P = 3.Now, moving on to part 2.The productivity P is modeled by the quadratic expression P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 3, where x is the time spent on research.We need to find the maximum productivity value and the corresponding research time.Since this is a quadratic function, it opens downward (because the coefficient of x² is negative), so the maximum occurs at the vertex.The vertex of a quadratic function ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a).Here, a = -2, b = 8.So, x = -8/(2*(-2)) = -8/(-4) = 2.So, the maximum productivity occurs when x = 2 hours.Now, let's compute P(2):P(2) = -2*(2)² + 8*(2) + 3 = -2*4 + 16 + 3 = -8 + 16 + 3 = 11.So, the maximum productivity is 11 when x = 2 hours.Wait, but in part 1, we had R = 6, which is more than 2. So, is this conflicting?Wait, no, because in part 1, we were just finding a possible set of values, not necessarily the one that maximizes productivity. So, the maximum productivity occurs at x = 2, but in the schedule, R could be higher or lower depending on other constraints.But the question is just to find the maximum productivity value and the corresponding research time, regardless of the schedule constraints. So, even if in the schedule R is 6, the maximum productivity is achieved at R = 2.But wait, in the schedule, R is 6, which is more than 2. So, if the laureate spends more time on research, productivity might decrease because of the quadratic model.But the question is separate from the schedule constraints. It's just modeling productivity as a function of research time, so regardless of the schedule, the maximum is at x = 2.So, the answer is maximum productivity 11 at x = 2.But let me double-check the calculations.P(x) = -2x² + 8x + 3Vertex at x = -b/(2a) = -8/(2*(-2)) = 2.P(2) = -2*(4) + 16 + 3 = -8 + 16 + 3 = 11. Correct.Yes, that seems right.So, summarizing:1. A possible set is R = 6, T = 4, M = 3, P = 3.2. Maximum productivity is 11 at x = 2 hours of research."},{"question":"Write the decomposition of the vector ( x ) in terms of the vectors ( p, q, r ):( x = {23, -14, -30} )( p = {2, 1, 0} )( q = {1, -1, 0} )( r = {-3, 2, 5} )","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to decompose the vector ( x = {23, -14, -30} ) in terms of the vectors ( p = {2, 1, 0} ), ( q = {1, -1, 0} ), and ( r = {-3, 2, 5} ).

Let’s define ( A' ) as the new number of kits for Group A and ( B' ) as the new number for Group B.The new conditions are:[B' = 2A'][A' + B' = 200]Substituting ( B' ) from the first equation into the second:[A' + 2A' = 200][3A' = 200][A' = frac{200}{3} approx 66.67]Since the number of kits must be a whole number, we can adjust the numbers to ensure they add up to 200. Therefore, the relief worker needs approximately 67 kits for Group A and 133 kits for Group B."},{"question":"Evaluate leftlceilsqrt{2},rightrceil+leftlceilsqrt{22},rightrceil+leftlceilsqrt{222},rightrceil.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to evaluate the sum of three ceiling functions of square roots. Specifically, it's the ceiling of sqrt(2) plus the ceiling of sqrt(22) plus the ceiling of sqrt(222). Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.First, I remember that the ceiling function, denoted by ⎡x⎤, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. So, if I have a number like 1.5, the ceiling would be 2. If I have 2.9, the ceiling is still 3. If it's already an integer, like 3, then the ceiling is just 3. Got it.So, I need to compute each of these three terms separately and then add them up. Let me start with the first one: ceiling of sqrt(2).I know that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142. Since 1.4142 is less than 2 but more than 1, the ceiling of this would be 2. So, that's straightforward. So, the first term is 2.Moving on to the second term: ceiling of sqrt(22). Hmm, okay. I need to figure out what sqrt(22) is approximately. Let me recall that sqrt(16) is 4 and sqrt(25) is 5. So, sqrt(22) is somewhere between 4 and 5. Let me get a better approximation.I know that 4.5 squared is 20.25 because 4.5 times 4.5 is 20.25. So, 4.5 squared is 20.25, which is less than 22. So, sqrt(22) is more than 4.5. Let me try 4.6. 4.6 squared is 21.16. Still less than 22. Next, 4.7 squared is 22.09. Oh, that's just a bit over 22. So, sqrt(22) is approximately 4.690 something.Wait, 4.7 squared is 22.09, which is just a little over 22. So, sqrt(22) is a little less than 4.7. So, approximately 4.69. So, since 4.69 is less than 5, the ceiling of sqrt(22) would be 5. So, the second term is 5.Now, the third term: ceiling of sqrt(222). Hmm, okay. This one might be a bit trickier. Let me think. I know that sqrt(225) is 15 because 15 times 15 is 225. So, sqrt(222) is just a bit less than 15. Let me see how much less.Let me compute 14.9 squared. 14.9 times 14.9. Let's calculate that. 14 times 14 is 196. 14 times 0.9 is 12.6, and 0.9 times 14 is another 12.6, and 0.9 times 0.9 is 0.81. So, adding those up: 196 + 12.6 + 12.6 + 0.81. Let me compute that step by step.196 + 12.6 is 208.6. Then, 208.6 + 12.6 is 221.2. Then, 221.2 + 0.81 is 222.01. Oh, interesting. So, 14.9 squared is 222.01. So, that's just a bit over 222. So, sqrt(222) is just a little less than 14.9.Wait, so sqrt(222) is approximately 14.899 something. So, it's just under 14.9. Therefore, the ceiling of sqrt(222) would be 15, since 14.899 is less than 15 but more than 14. So, the ceiling function would round it up to 15. So, the third term is 15.Wait, hold on a second. Let me verify that. If 14.9 squared is 222.01, which is just barely over 222, then sqrt(222) is just a tiny bit less than 14.9. So, 14.899... So, since 14.899 is less than 15, the ceiling is 15. So, yes, that seems correct.So, putting it all together: the first term is 2, the second term is 5, and the third term is 15. So, adding them up: 2 + 5 is 7, and 7 + 15 is 22. So, the total sum is 22.Wait, let me double-check each term just to be sure I didn't make a mistake.First term: sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, ceiling is 2. Correct.Second term: sqrt(22) is approximately 4.69, ceiling is 5. Correct.Third term: sqrt(222) is approximately 14.899, ceiling is 15. Correct.So, 2 + 5 + 15 is indeed 22. So, I think that's the answer.But wait, just to make sure, let me think about sqrt(222) again. I remember that 14.9 squared is 222.01, which is just over 222, so sqrt(222) is just under 14.9. So, 14.899... So, it's definitely less than 15, so the ceiling is 15. So, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I can compute sqrt(222) more precisely. Let's see, 14.9 squared is 222.01, so sqrt(222) is 14.9 minus a tiny bit. Let me compute 14.9 squared as 222.01, so sqrt(222) is 14.9 - (222.01 - 222)/(2*14.9). That's using the linear approximation for square roots.So, the difference is 0.01, so delta x is -0.01. So, the derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2*sqrt(x)). So, approximately, sqrt(222) ≈ sqrt(222.01) - (0.01)/(2*sqrt(222.01)). So, sqrt(222.01) is 14.9, so sqrt(222) ≈ 14.9 - (0.01)/(2*14.9). Let's compute that.0.01 divided by (2*14.9) is 0.01 / 29.8 ≈ 0.0003356. So, sqrt(222) ≈ 14.9 - 0.0003356 ≈ 14.899664. So, approximately 14.899664. So, that's about 14.8997. So, still, the ceiling is 15.So, yeah, that confirms it. So, the third term is 15.Therefore, adding them all together: 2 + 5 + 15 is 22. So, I think that's the correct answer.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute each square root with a calculator in my mind.sqrt(2): I know that 1.4142 squared is 2, so that's exact. So, ceiling is 2.sqrt(22): Let me see, 4.69 squared is approximately 22. So, 4.69*4.69. Let me compute 4*4 is 16, 4*0.69 is 2.76, 0.69*4 is another 2.76, and 0.69*0.69 is 0.4761. So, adding those up: 16 + 2.76 + 2.76 + 0.4761. So, 16 + 2.76 is 18.76, plus another 2.76 is 21.52, plus 0.4761 is 22.0 approximately. So, 4.69 squared is roughly 22, so sqrt(22) is approximately 4.69, which is less than 5, so ceiling is 5.sqrt(222): As above, 14.9 squared is 222.01, so sqrt(222) is just a little less, so ceiling is 15.So, yeah, all three terms are correct.Therefore, adding them up: 2 + 5 is 7, plus 15 is 22. So, the final answer is 22.Wait, just to make sure, let me think if there's any chance I could have messed up the ceiling function. For example, if the square root was exactly an integer, would I have to adjust? But in this case, none of the square roots are exact integers. sqrt(2) is irrational, sqrt(22) is irrational, sqrt(222) is irrational. So, their ceilings are just the next integer. So, that's correct.Alternatively, if I had, say, sqrt(25), which is 5, then the ceiling would still be 5. But in this case, none of them are perfect squares, so the ceilings are the next integers.So, yeah, I think I'm confident that the answer is 22.**Final Answer**boxed{22}"},{"question":"An investor is considering a merger of their AI tool with a rival entrepreneur's AI tool. The performance of their current AI tool can be modeled by the polynomial function ( P(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 ), where ( x ) represents the number of computational units allocated, and ( P(x) ) represents the efficiency score of the AI tool.1. The rival entrepreneur's AI tool is modeled by the polynomial function ( R(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 6 ). If the investor plans to merge both AI tools into a single tool, the combined efficiency score is given by the sum of the two polynomial functions. Write the polynomial expression for the combined AI tool and simplify it.2. The investor needs to ensure that the combined AI tool has a positive efficiency score for a certain range of computational units, specifically when ( x ) is between 1 and 4 inclusive. Determine the range of integer values of ( x ) within this interval for which the combined polynomial function is positive.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where an investor is looking to merge their AI tool with a rival's. The performance of their current AI tool is given by the polynomial ( P(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 ), and the rival's is ( R(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 6 ). The investor wants to know two things: first, the combined efficiency polynomial after merging, and second, the range of integer values of ( x ) between 1 and 4 where the combined efficiency is positive.Starting with the first part, I need to find the sum of ( P(x) ) and ( R(x) ). That should be straightforward—just add the corresponding coefficients of each term. Let me write down both polynomials:( P(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 )( R(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 6 )Adding them together term by term:For ( x^3 ): ( 2x^3 + x^3 = 3x^3 )For ( x^2 ): ( -5x^2 + (-3x^2) = -8x^2 )For ( x ): ( 3x + 4x = 7x )For the constants: ( -4 + (-6) = -10 )So, combining all these, the merged polynomial should be:( C(x) = 3x^3 - 8x^2 + 7x - 10 )Let me double-check that:- ( 2x^3 + x^3 = 3x^3 ) ✔️- ( -5x^2 - 3x^2 = -8x^2 ) ✔️- ( 3x + 4x = 7x ) ✔️- ( -4 - 6 = -10 ) ✔️Yep, that seems right. So, part 1 is done.Moving on to part 2. The investor wants the combined efficiency to be positive when ( x ) is between 1 and 4 inclusive. They specifically ask for the range of integer values of ( x ) within this interval where ( C(x) > 0 ).Since ( x ) is an integer between 1 and 4, inclusive, that means ( x = 1, 2, 3, 4 ). So, I can evaluate ( C(x) ) at each of these points and check if the result is positive.Let me compute ( C(1) ), ( C(2) ), ( C(3) ), and ( C(4) ).Starting with ( x = 1 ):( C(1) = 3(1)^3 - 8(1)^2 + 7(1) - 10 )Calculating each term:- ( 3(1)^3 = 3 )- ( -8(1)^2 = -8 )- ( 7(1) = 7 )- ( -10 = -10 )Adding them up: ( 3 - 8 + 7 - 10 = (3 - 8) + (7 - 10) = (-5) + (-3) = -8 )So, ( C(1) = -8 ), which is negative. Not good.Next, ( x = 2 ):( C(2) = 3(2)^3 - 8(2)^2 + 7(2) - 10 )Calculating each term:- ( 3(8) = 24 )- ( -8(4) = -32 )- ( 7(2) = 14 )- ( -10 = -10 )Adding them up: ( 24 - 32 + 14 - 10 = (24 - 32) + (14 - 10) = (-8) + 4 = -4 )So, ( C(2) = -4 ), still negative.Moving on to ( x = 3 ):( C(3) = 3(3)^3 - 8(3)^2 + 7(3) - 10 )Calculating each term:- ( 3(27) = 81 )- ( -8(9) = -72 )- ( 7(3) = 21 )- ( -10 = -10 )Adding them up: ( 81 - 72 + 21 - 10 = (81 - 72) + (21 - 10) = 9 + 11 = 20 )So, ( C(3) = 20 ), which is positive.Finally, ( x = 4 ):( C(4) = 3(4)^3 - 8(4)^2 + 7(4) - 10 )Calculating each term:- ( 3(64) = 192 )- ( -8(16) = -128 )- ( 7(4) = 28 )- ( -10 = -10 )Adding them up: ( 192 - 128 + 28 - 10 = (192 - 128) + (28 - 10) = 64 + 18 = 82 )So, ( C(4) = 82 ), which is positive.Therefore, evaluating at each integer from 1 to 4:- ( x = 1 ): Negative- ( x = 2 ): Negative- ( x = 3 ): Positive- ( x = 4 ): PositiveSo, the combined efficiency is positive at ( x = 3 ) and ( x = 4 ).Wait, but the question says \\"the range of integer values of ( x ) within this interval for which the combined polynomial function is positive.\\" So, that would be ( x = 3 ) and ( x = 4 ). So, the range is from 3 to 4 inclusive, but since they are integers, it's just those two points.But just to make sure, maybe I should check if the function is positive in between these integers or not, but since the question specifically asks for integer values, I think it's okay. But just to be thorough, maybe I should check if the function crosses zero between 2 and 3 or between 3 and 4.So, let's see. The function ( C(x) = 3x^3 - 8x^2 + 7x - 10 ).We know that at ( x = 2 ), it's -4, and at ( x = 3 ), it's 20. So, it goes from negative to positive between 2 and 3, meaning there's a root somewhere in (2,3). Similarly, between 3 and 4, it goes from 20 to 82, so it's increasing.But since the question is about integer values, we don't need to consider non-integer points. So, only at ( x = 3 ) and ( x = 4 ) is the function positive.Wait, but just to be extra careful, maybe I should check if the function is positive for all ( x ) between 3 and 4, but since the question is about integer values, it's only at 3 and 4.Alternatively, if the question had asked for all real numbers between 1 and 4, we would have to find the interval where ( C(x) > 0 ), but since it's specifically integer values, it's just 3 and 4.Therefore, the integer values of ( x ) where the combined efficiency is positive are 3 and 4.So, summarizing:1. The combined polynomial is ( 3x^3 - 8x^2 + 7x - 10 ).2. The integer values of ( x ) between 1 and 4 where the efficiency is positive are 3 and 4.I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, but let me just quickly recheck the evaluations:At ( x = 1 ): 3 - 8 + 7 - 10 = -8 ✔️At ( x = 2 ): 24 - 32 + 14 -10 = -4 ✔️At ( x = 3 ): 81 - 72 + 21 -10 = 20 ✔️At ( x = 4 ): 192 - 128 + 28 -10 = 82 ✔️Yep, all correct. So, the conclusion is solid."},{"question":"The [average](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Average) weight of 6 boys is 150 pounds and the average weight of 4 girls is 120 pounds.

This time, they have decided to play a trick by filling balloons with water. The prankster insists that his formula for the perfect splash is to use the volume of the balloons to calculate the height from which they should be dropped.1. The prankster's formula for the perfect splash involves a polynomial equation based on the volume ( V ) of the balloon in cubic centimeters. If the volume of the balloon is given by ( V = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ), where ( x ) represents some factor related to the balloon's size, solve for ( x ) when the volume is 0.2. After successfully solving the equation, Wayne decides to make things more interesting. He sets up an inequality to determine the maximum volume the balloons can have before they become too heavy to lift. The inequality is ( x^2 + 4x - 12 < 0 ). Solve for the range of ( x ) values that satisfy this inequality to help Wayne and the prankster plan their next splashy prank.","answer":"Alright, so I've got these two math problems to solve, both related to Wayne and the prankster's balloon antics. Let me take them one at a time.Starting with the first problem: The prankster has a formula for the volume of a balloon, which is given by the polynomial ( V = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ). We need to find the values of ( x ) when the volume ( V ) is 0. So essentially, we're looking for the roots of this cubic equation.Hmm, solving a cubic equation can be a bit tricky, but maybe I can factor it. Let me try to factor ( x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ). I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can help find possible roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -6, and the leading coefficient is 1, so the possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.Let me test these one by one. I'll start with ( x = 1 ):( 1^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0 ). Oh, that works! So ( x = 1 ) is a root.Now, since ( x = 1 ) is a root, I can factor out ( (x - 1) ) from the polynomial. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.Using synthetic division with root 1:Coefficients: 1 | -6 | 11 | -6Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by 1: 1, add to -6: -5Multiply -5 by 1: -5, add to 11: 6Multiply 6 by 1: 6, add to -6: 0So the polynomial factors into ( (x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6) ).Now, let's factor the quadratic ( x^2 - 5x + 6 ). Looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5. Those would be -2 and -3.So, ( x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) ).Putting it all together, the polynomial factors as ( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) ).Therefore, the roots are ( x = 1 ), ( x = 2 ), and ( x = 3 ).So, when the volume ( V ) is 0, ( x ) can be 1, 2, or 3. That makes sense because these are the points where the balloon's volume would theoretically be zero, maybe at certain critical sizes.Moving on to the second problem: Wayne set up an inequality ( x^2 + 4x - 12 < 0 ) to determine the maximum volume before the balloons become too heavy. We need to solve this inequality for ( x ).First, let me solve the corresponding equation ( x^2 + 4x - 12 = 0 ) to find the critical points.Using the quadratic formula: ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = 1 ), ( b = 4 ), and ( c = -12 ).Calculating the discriminant: ( b^2 - 4ac = 16 - 4(1)(-12) = 16 + 48 = 64 ).So, the roots are ( x = frac{-4 pm sqrt{64}}{2} = frac{-4 pm 8}{2} ).That gives two solutions:1. ( x = frac{-4 + 8}{2} = frac{4}{2} = 2 )2. ( x = frac{-4 - 8}{2} = frac{-12}{2} = -6 )So, the critical points are at ( x = -6 ) and ( x = 2 ). These divide the number line into three intervals: ( (-infty, -6) ), ( (-6, 2) ), and ( (2, infty) ).To determine where the quadratic expression ( x^2 + 4x - 12 ) is less than zero, we can test each interval.1. **Interval ( (-infty, -6) ):** Let's pick ( x = -7 ).   ( (-7)^2 + 4(-7) - 12 = 49 - 28 - 12 = 9 ), which is positive. So, the expression is positive here.2. **Interval ( (-6, 2) ):** Let's pick ( x = 0 ).   ( 0^2 + 4(0) - 12 = -12 ), which is negative. So, the expression is negative here.3. **Interval ( (2, infty) ):** Let's pick ( x = 3 ).   ( 3^2 + 4(3) - 12 = 9 + 12 - 12 = 9 ), which is positive. So, the expression is positive here.Since the inequality is ( x^2 + 4x - 12 < 0 ), we're looking for where the expression is negative. That occurs in the interval ( (-6, 2) ).But wait, in the context of the problem, ( x ) represents some factor related to the balloon's size. I assume ( x ) must be a positive value because size can't be negative. So, even though mathematically the solution is ( (-6, 2) ), physically, ( x ) can't be negative. Therefore, the relevant interval is ( (0, 2) ).But just to be thorough, let's check if ( x = -6 ) or ( x = 2 ) are included. The inequality is strict (< 0), so the endpoints are not included. Hence, the solution is ( x ) between -6 and 2, but since ( x ) must be positive, it's between 0 and 2.Wait, hold on. The original problem didn't specify if ( x ) has to be positive. It just says \\"some factor related to the balloon's size.\\" Size factors could be positive, but maybe in the context, ( x ) could be any real number? Hmm, but in reality, factors related to size are usually positive. So, perhaps the meaningful solution is ( 0 < x < 2 ).But let me think again. If ( x ) can be negative, then the full solution is ( -6 < x < 2 ). But in the context of the problem, probably ( x ) is positive, so only ( 0 < x < 2 ).But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I should present both? Or just the mathematical solution regardless of context.Wait, the first problem had ( x ) as 1, 2, 3, which are positive. So, in the context, ( x ) is positive. Therefore, the relevant interval is ( 0 < x < 2 ).But to be precise, let me check the original inequality: ( x^2 + 4x - 12 < 0 ). The quadratic opens upwards because the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive. So, it will be below zero between its two roots, which are at ( x = -6 ) and ( x = 2 ). So, the solution is ( -6 < x < 2 ).But in the context of the problem, if ( x ) is a factor related to balloon size, it's likely that ( x ) must be positive. So, the practical solution is ( 0 < x < 2 ). However, since the problem didn't specify, maybe I should just give the mathematical solution, which is ( (-6, 2) ).But let me verify. If ( x ) can be negative, then yes, the solution is ( -6 < x < 2 ). If ( x ) must be positive, it's ( 0 < x < 2 ). Since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's safer to give the mathematical solution without assuming context. So, the range is ( -6 < x < 2 ).But wait, in the first problem, ( x ) was 1, 2, 3, which are positive. So, maybe in the second problem, ( x ) is also positive. Therefore, the meaningful solution is ( 0 < x < 2 ).Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.In the first problem, ( x ) was a factor related to the balloon's size, and the roots were positive. So, in the second problem, the same ( x ) is used, which is a factor related to the balloon's size, so it's likely positive. Therefore, the solution should be ( 0 < x < 2 ).But to be thorough, I'll present both solutions and then decide.Mathematically, the solution is ( -6 < x < 2 ). But considering the context, ( x ) must be positive, so ( 0 < x < 2 ).I think the problem expects the mathematical solution without considering context, so ( -6 < x < 2 ). But since in the first problem, ( x ) was positive, maybe the second problem also expects positive ( x ). Hmm.Wait, the second problem is about the maximum volume before they become too heavy. So, if ( x ) is a factor related to size, it's positive. Therefore, the relevant interval is ( 0 < x < 2 ).But let me check the quadratic at ( x = 0 ): ( 0 + 0 - 12 = -12 < 0 ). So, at ( x = 0 ), the expression is negative. But ( x = 0 ) would mean no size, which is not practical. So, maybe the interval is ( 0 < x < 2 ).Alternatively, if ( x ) can be zero, then ( x = 0 ) is included, but since it's an inequality, it's not. So, the solution is ( x ) between -6 and 2, but in context, ( x ) is positive, so ( 0 < x < 2 ).I think that's the right approach. So, the range of ( x ) values is from 0 to 2, not including the endpoints.But to make sure, let me test ( x = 1 ) in the inequality: ( 1 + 4 - 12 = -7 < 0 ), which is true. ( x = 3 ): ( 9 + 12 - 12 = 9 > 0 ), which is false. ( x = -7 ): ( 49 - 28 - 12 = 9 > 0 ), which is false. So, only between -6 and 2 is the inequality true.But again, in context, ( x ) is positive, so only between 0 and 2.I think that's the answer they're looking for.So, summarizing:1. The roots of the volume equation are ( x = 1 ), ( x = 2 ), and ( x = 3 ).2. The solution to the inequality is ( -6 < x < 2 ), but considering context, ( 0 < x < 2 ).But since the problem didn't specify context for the second part, maybe I should stick to the mathematical solution.Wait, the first problem was about volume being 0, which gave positive roots. The second problem is about the maximum volume before they become too heavy, so it's about the range where the volume is less than a certain value. But the inequality given is ( x^2 + 4x - 12 < 0 ), which is a quadratic in ( x ). So, the solution is ( -6 < x < 2 ). But in the context of the problem, ( x ) is a factor related to size, which is positive. So, the meaningful range is ( 0 < x < 2 ).Therefore, the answer is ( 0 < x < 2 ).But to be precise, let me write both solutions and then choose.Mathematically: ( -6 < x < 2 ).Contextually: ( 0 < x < 2 ).Since the problem is about balloons and their size, I think the contextually relevant solution is ( 0 < x < 2 ).So, I'll go with that.**Final Answer**1. The solutions are (boxed{1}), (boxed{2}), and (boxed{3}).2.

After expanding the garden, the resident decides to install a solar-powered water system, which costs 15 per square foot of the new garden area. Determine the total cost of the water system after the expansion, using the values of ( x ) found in part 1.","answer":"First, I need to understand the original dimensions of the garden, which are 8 feet by 10 feet. The resident wants to increase the area by 50 square feet by expanding the width by ( x ) feet and the length by ( 2x ) feet.To find the new dimensions, I'll add ( x ) to the original width and ( 2x ) to the original length. This gives me the new width as ( 8 + x ) feet and the new length as ( 10 + 2x ) feet.Next, I'll set up the equation for the new area by multiplying the new width and length: ((8 + x)(10 + 2x)). The original area is ( 8 times 10 = 80 ) square feet, and the new area should be ( 80 + 50 = 130 ) square feet.Expanding the equation ((8 + x)(10 + 2x)) gives me ( 80 + 26x + 2x^2 ). Setting this equal to 130, I'll form the quadratic equation ( 2x^2 + 26x + 80 - 130 = 0 ), which simplifies to ( 2x^2 + 26x - 50 = 0 ).To solve for ( x ), I'll use the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = 2 ), ( b = 26 ), and ( c = -50 ).

Let me try to figure out how to approach this. It looks like a complex integral, so maybe I can use some theorems from complex analysis, like Cauchy's integral formula or residue theorem. But first, let me understand the contour and the function involved.The contour is given by |z - i| = 3/2. That's a circle centered at i with radius 3/2. So, in the complex plane, this circle is centered at the point (0,1) and has a radius of 1.5. I should sketch this mentally or maybe on paper to visualize where the singularities of the function lie.The function to integrate is frac{e^{1 / z^{2}}}{z^{2}+1}. Let me break this down. The denominator is z^2 + 1, which factors into (z - i)(z + i). So, the function has singularities at z = i and z = -i. The numerator is e^{1/z^2}, which is an entire function except at z = 0, where it has an essential singularity because of the 1/z^2 term.So, the integrand has singularities at z = i, z = -i, and z = 0. Now, I need to determine which of these singularities lie inside the contour |z - i| = 3/2.First, let's check z = i. The contour is a circle centered at i with radius 3/2, so z = i is definitely inside the contour because the distance from i to itself is zero, which is less than 3/2.Next, z = -i. The distance from i to -i is |i - (-i)| = |2i| = 2. Since the radius of the contour is 3/2 = 1.5, which is less than 2, the point z = -i lies outside the contour. So, it won't contribute to the integral.Lastly, z = 0. The distance from i to 0 is |i - 0| = 1, which is less than 3/2, so z = 0 is inside the contour. Therefore, the integrand has two singularities inside the contour: z = i and z = 0.Now, to compute the integral, I can use the residue theorem, which states that the integral of a function around a closed contour is 2pi i times the sum of the residues of the function at the singularities inside the contour. So, I need to find the residues at z = i and z = 0.Let me start with the residue at z = i. The function is frac{e^{1/z^2}}{z^2 + 1}. Let me rewrite the denominator as (z - i)(z + i). So, near z = i, the function can be expressed as frac{e^{1/z^2}}{(z - i)(z + i)}. Therefore, z = i is a simple pole because the denominator has a single factor of (z - i).For a simple pole at z = a, the residue is given by lim_{z to a} (z - a)f(z). So, in this case, the residue at z = i is:text{Res}_{z = i} f(z) = lim_{z to i} (z - i) cdot frac{e^{1/z^2}}{(z - i)(z + i)} = lim_{z to i} frac{e^{1/z^2}}{z + i}Simplifying, this becomes:frac{e^{1/i^2}}{i + i} = frac{e^{-1}}{2i}Wait, hold on. Let me compute 1/i^2. Since i^2 = -1, so 1/i^2 = -1. Therefore, e^{1/i^2} = e^{-1}. So, the residue is:frac{e^{-1}}{2i}But I should express this in terms of real and imaginary parts or just keep it as is for now.Now, moving on to the residue at z = 0. This is going to be more complicated because z = 0 is an essential singularity due to the e^{1/z^2} term. Essential singularities are trickier because they require expanding the function into a Laurent series and finding the coefficient of (z - a)^{-1}.So, let me consider the function near z = 0. The function is frac{e^{1/z^2}}{z^2 + 1}. Let me write this as e^{1/z^2} cdot frac{1}{z^2 + 1}. I can expand both parts into their Laurent series.First, let's expand e^{1/z^2}. The exponential function has the series expansion:e^{w} = sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{w^n}{n!}So, substituting w = 1/z^2, we get:e^{1/z^2} = sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{1}{n! z^{2n}}That's the expansion for e^{1/z^2}.Next, let's expand frac{1}{z^2 + 1}. This can be written as frac{1}{1 - (-z^2)}, which is a geometric series:frac{1}{1 - (-z^2)} = sum_{m=0}^{infty} (-1)^m z^{2m}This series converges when |z^2| < 1, which is true near z = 0 since the radius of convergence is 1.So, now, the function near z = 0 is the product of these two series:left( sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{1}{n! z^{2n}} right) cdot left( sum_{m=0}^{infty} (-1)^m z^{2m} right)To find the residue, which is the coefficient of z^{-1} in the Laurent series, I need to find all pairs of (n, m) such that the exponent of z is -1. That is, for each term in the product, the exponent is -2n + 2m = -1. So, solving for integers n and m:-2n + 2m = -1 implies 2m - 2n = -1 implies 2(m - n) = -1But m and n are integers, so 2(m - n) must be even, but the right-hand side is -1, which is odd. Therefore, there are no solutions for m and n that satisfy this equation. That means the coefficient of z^{-1} is zero.Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. If I multiply the two series, each term is of the form frac{(-1)^m}{n!} z^{2m - 2n}. So, for the exponent to be -1, we need 2m - 2n = -1, which simplifies to 2(m - n) = -1, as before. Since m and n are integers, m - n must be a half-integer, which is impossible. Therefore, there is no term with z^{-1} in the product, so the residue at z = 0 is zero.Hmm, that's interesting. So, the residue at z = 0 is zero. Therefore, the only contribution to the integral comes from the residue at z = i.So, putting it all together, the integral is 2pi i times the sum of the residues inside the contour. The residues are frac{e^{-1}}{2i} at z = i and 0 at z = 0. So, the sum is just frac{e^{-1}}{2i}.Therefore, the integral is:2pi i cdot frac{e^{-1}}{2i} = pi e^{-1}Simplifying, that's frac{pi}{e}.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the residue at z = i. I had:text{Res}_{z = i} f(z) = frac{e^{-1}}{2i}But when I multiply by 2pi i, it becomes:2pi i cdot frac{e^{-1}}{2i} = pi e^{-1}Yes, that seems correct. The i in the denominator cancels with the i in the numerator, leaving pi/e.So, the final answer should be pi/e.But just to be thorough, let me recap:1. The contour is a circle centered at i with radius 3/2.2. The function has singularities at z = i, z = -i, and z = 0.3. Only z = i and z = 0 are inside the contour.4. Residue at z = i is frac{e^{-1}}{2i}.5. Residue at z = 0 is 0 because the Laurent series has no z^{-1} term.6. Integral is 2pi i times sum of residues, which is 2pi i cdot frac{e^{-1}}{2i} = pi e^{-1}.Yes, that seems consistent.I think I'm confident with this result. So, the value of the integral is pi/e.**Final Answer**The value of the integral is boxed{dfrac{pi}{e}}."},{"question":"A cryptocurrency exchange platform is analyzing transactions to enhance their fraud detection system.

Determine the transaction amounts (in hundreds of dollars) that could potentially be fraudulent by finding the real roots of the polynomial function ( f(x) ).2. Additionally, the platform sets a threshold inequality for transaction monitoring: ( 2x^2 - 8x + 6 > 0 ). Find the range of transaction amounts (in hundreds of dollars) that require additional monitoring based on this inequality.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a cryptocurrency exchange platform trying to detect fraudulent transactions. They've given me a polynomial function, ( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ), and I need to find the real roots of this polynomial to determine potential fraudulent transaction amounts. Then, there's a second part where I have to solve an inequality, ( 2x^2 - 8x + 6 > 0 ), to find the range of transaction amounts that need additional monitoring.Starting with the first part: finding the real roots of the polynomial ( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 ). I remember that finding roots of polynomials can sometimes be done by factoring, especially if the polynomial can be factored into simpler terms. Since it's a cubic polynomial, I might try to factor it into a product of a linear term and a quadratic term.First, I can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction ( frac{p}{q} ), where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -6, and the leading coefficient is 1. So the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.I'll test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial.Testing x=1:( f(1) = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0 ). Oh, so x=1 is a root!Great, so (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial. Now, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 1) from the cubic polynomial.Let me use synthetic division with x=1.Set up the coefficients: 1 (for x^3), -6 (for x^2), 11 (for x), -6 (constant term).Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by 1, get 1. Add to -6: -5.Multiply -5 by 1: -5. Add to 11: 6.Multiply 6 by 1: 6. Add to -6: 0. Perfect, so the result is 1x^2 -5x +6.So now, the polynomial factors as (x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6).Now, I need to factor the quadratic ( x^2 - 5x + 6 ). Let's see, factors of 6 that add up to -5. Hmm, -2 and -3. So, it factors into (x - 2)(x - 3).Therefore, the full factorization is ( f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) ).So, the real roots are x=1, x=2, and x=3. Since x represents the transaction amount in hundreds of dollars, these roots correspond to 100, 200, and 300. So, these are the transaction amounts that could potentially be fraudulent.Moving on to the second part: solving the inequality ( 2x^2 - 8x + 6 > 0 ). I need to find the range of x where this quadratic expression is positive.First, let's simplify the inequality if possible. I can factor out a 2:( 2(x^2 - 4x + 3) > 0 ).Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 is positive, the inequality sign doesn't change):( x^2 - 4x + 3 > 0 ).Now, let's factor the quadratic ( x^2 - 4x + 3 ). Looking for two numbers that multiply to 3 and add to -4. Those numbers are -1 and -3.So, it factors to ( (x - 1)(x - 3) > 0 ).Now, to solve the inequality ( (x - 1)(x - 3) > 0 ), I can use a sign chart.The critical points are x=1 and x=3. These divide the number line into three intervals:1. x < 12. 1 < x < 33. x > 3I'll test each interval.1. For x < 1, say x=0: (0 -1)(0 - 3) = (-1)(-3) = 3 > 0. So, positive.2. For 1 < x < 3, say x=2: (2 -1)(2 - 3) = (1)(-1) = -1 < 0. Negative.3. For x > 3, say x=4: (4 -1)(4 - 3) = (3)(1) = 3 > 0. Positive.Since the inequality is looking for where the expression is greater than 0, the solution is x < 1 or x > 3.But wait, let me double-check. The quadratic ( x^2 - 4x + 3 ) opens upwards because the coefficient of x^2 is positive. So, it will be positive outside the roots and negative between them. So yes, x < 1 or x > 3.But in the context of the problem, x represents transaction amounts in hundreds of dollars. So, x must be positive. Therefore, the range of transaction amounts that require additional monitoring is x < 1 or x > 3, in hundreds of dollars, which translates to transactions less than 100 or more than 300.Wait, but let me think again. The inequality was ( 2x^2 - 8x + 6 > 0 ). After factoring, we had ( (x - 1)(x - 3) > 0 ). So, the solution is indeed x < 1 or x > 3. So, in terms of hundreds of dollars, that's less than 100 or more than 300.But let me verify by plugging in values.For x=0: 2(0)^2 -8(0) +6 = 6 >0. Correct.For x=2: 2(4) -16 +6 = 8 -16 +6 = -2 <0. Correct.For x=4: 2(16) -32 +6 =32 -32 +6=6>0. Correct.So, yes, the inequality holds for x <1 and x>3.Therefore, the ranges are x <1 and x>3.But wait, in the context of transaction amounts, can x be negative? Probably not, since transaction amounts can't be negative. So, x must be greater than or equal to 0. So, the solution is 0 ≤ x <1 and x>3.But since x=1 and x=3 are roots, and the inequality is strict (>0), those points are not included.So, in conclusion, the transaction amounts that require additional monitoring are those less than 100 (x <1) or more than 300 (x>3).Wait, but let me think again about the inequality. The original inequality was ( 2x^2 -8x +6 >0 ). If I consider x=1, plugging in, 2(1) -8(1) +6= 2 -8 +6=0. So, at x=1, it's equal to zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. Similarly, at x=3, it's zero. So, the solution is indeed x <1 or x>3.But since x represents transaction amounts in hundreds of dollars, x must be non-negative. So, the range is 0 ≤ x <1 and x>3.But in the problem statement, it's about transaction amounts, so x can't be negative, so the lower bound is x ≥0.Therefore, the ranges are 0 ≤ x <1 and x>3.But in terms of the answer, since the question says \\"range of transaction amounts (in hundreds of dollars)\\", we can express it as x <1 and x>3, with the understanding that x is non-negative.So, to summarize:1. The real roots of the polynomial are x=1, x=2, x=3. So, transaction amounts of 100, 200, 300 are potential frauds.2. The inequality ( 2x^2 -8x +6 >0 ) holds for x <1 and x>3, meaning transactions less than 100 or more than 300 require additional monitoring.I think that's it. Let me just double-check my factoring and roots.For the polynomial: ( x^3 -6x^2 +11x -6 ). Factored as (x-1)(x-2)(x-3). Plugging in x=1: (0)(-1)(-2)=0. Correct. Similarly for x=2 and x=3.For the inequality: 2x^2 -8x +6. Factored as 2(x-1)(x-3). So, when is this >0? When (x-1)(x-3) >0, which is when x <1 or x>3. Correct.Yes, I think I've got it right."},{"question":"The value of tan225^circ is.","answer":"To find the value of (tan 225^circ), I start by recognizing that 225 degrees is located in the third quadrant of the unit circle.In the third quadrant, both sine and cosine values are negative.

Determine the maximum height of the arch and the position along the base where this maximum height occurs.2. A local artist wants to install a stained glass piece in the archway, which will be supported between the points where the arch is 5 feet high. Calculate the distance between these two points along the base.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an archway in a historical town, and it's modeled by a quadratic function. The equation given is ( h(x) = -2x^2 + 8x + 3 ). I need to figure out two things: first, the maximum height of the arch and where it occurs, and second, the distance between the two points where the arch is 5 feet high. Let me start with the first part. I remember that quadratic functions have either a maximum or a minimum value, depending on the coefficient of the ( x^2 ) term. In this case, the coefficient is -2, which is negative, so the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of the parabola is the maximum point. So, the maximum height is at the vertex.To find the vertex, I can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex, which is ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ). In the equation ( h(x) = -2x^2 + 8x + 3 ), the coefficients are a = -2, b = 8, and c = 3. Plugging into the formula, I get:( x = -frac{8}{2*(-2)} = -frac{8}{-4} = 2 ).So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is 2. That means the maximum height occurs at x = 2 feet from one end of the base. Now, to find the maximum height, I need to plug x = 2 back into the equation.Calculating ( h(2) ):( h(2) = -2*(2)^2 + 8*(2) + 3 ).First, ( 2^2 = 4 ), so:( h(2) = -2*4 + 16 + 3 ).Then, ( -2*4 = -8 ), so:( h(2) = -8 + 16 + 3 ).Adding those up: -8 + 16 is 8, and 8 + 3 is 11. So, the maximum height is 11 feet at x = 2 feet.Wait, let me double-check that calculation. So, ( h(2) = -2*(4) + 16 + 3 ). Yes, that's -8 + 16 is 8, plus 3 is 11. That seems right.Okay, so part one is done. The maximum height is 11 feet at 2 feet along the base.Now, moving on to part two. The artist wants to install a stained glass piece supported between the points where the arch is 5 feet high. So, I need to find the two x-values where h(x) = 5, and then find the distance between these two points.So, I'll set up the equation:( -2x^2 + 8x + 3 = 5 ).Subtracting 5 from both sides to set it to zero:( -2x^2 + 8x + 3 - 5 = 0 ).Simplify that:( -2x^2 + 8x - 2 = 0 ).Hmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:( -2x^2 + 8x - 2 = 0 ).I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by -2 to make the numbers smaller. Let's do that:Dividing each term by -2:( x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 ).Okay, so now the equation is ( x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 ). I need to solve for x. Since it's a quadratic, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ).In this equation, a = 1, b = -4, c = 1. Plugging into the formula:( x = frac{-(-4) pm sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4*1*1}}{2*1} ).Simplify step by step:First, ( -(-4) = 4 ).Then, inside the square root: ( (-4)^2 = 16 ), and ( 4*1*1 = 4 ). So, ( 16 - 4 = 12 ).So, the equation becomes:( x = frac{4 pm sqrt{12}}{2} ).Simplify ( sqrt{12} ). I know that ( sqrt{12} = sqrt{4*3} = 2sqrt{3} ). So, substituting back:( x = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{3}}{2} ).I can factor out a 2 in the numerator:( x = frac{2(2 pm sqrt{3})}{2} ).Cancel out the 2:( x = 2 pm sqrt{3} ).So, the two solutions are ( x = 2 + sqrt{3} ) and ( x = 2 - sqrt{3} ).Now, to find the distance between these two points along the base, I subtract the smaller x-value from the larger one.So, distance = ( (2 + sqrt{3}) - (2 - sqrt{3}) ).Simplify:( 2 + sqrt{3} - 2 + sqrt{3} = 2sqrt{3} ).Therefore, the distance between the two points is ( 2sqrt{3} ) feet.Wait, let me verify that. So, the two x-values are 2 + sqrt(3) and 2 - sqrt(3). The difference between them is (2 + sqrt(3)) - (2 - sqrt(3)) = 2 + sqrt(3) - 2 + sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3). Yeah, that's correct.Alternatively, since the quadratic equation was simplified to ( x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 ), the roots are symmetric around the vertex. The vertex is at x = 2, so each root is sqrt(3) away from 2 on either side. Therefore, the distance between them is 2 sqrt(3). That makes sense.So, to recap:1. The maximum height is 11 feet at x = 2 feet.2. The distance between the two points where the arch is 5 feet high is 2 sqrt(3) feet.I think that's all. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.For part one, plugging x = 2 into h(x):-2*(4) + 8*(2) + 3 = -8 + 16 + 3 = 11.

That might help me figure out the sum without having to compute all 2017 terms.Let's start calculating the terms step by step:- a_1 = 1- a_2 = 3- a_3 = a_2 - a_1 = 3 - 1 = 2- a_4 = a_3 - a_2 = 2 - 3 = -1- a_5 = a_4 - a_3 = -1 - 2 = -3- a_6 = a_5 - a_4 = -3 - (-1) = -3 + 1 = -2- a_7 = a_6 - a_5 = -2 - (-3) = -2 + 3 = 1- a_8 = a_7 - a_6 = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3- a_9 = a_8 - a_7 = 3 - 1 = 2- a_{10} = a_9 - a_8 = 2 - 3 = -1- a_{11} = a_{10} - a_9 = -1 - 2 = -3- a_{12} = a_{11} - a_{10} = -3 - (-1) = -3 + 1 = -2- a_{13} = a_{12} - a_{11} = -2 - (-3) = -2 + 3 = 1- a_{14} = a_{13} - a_{12} = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3Wait a minute, I see a pattern here. Starting from a_1, the terms are: 1, 3, 2, -1, -3, -2, 1, 3, 2, -1, -3, -2, 1, 3, and so on. It looks like the sequence repeats every 6 terms. Let me confirm:From a_1 to a_6: 1, 3, 2, -1, -3, -2From a_7 to a_{12}: 1, 3, 2, -1, -3, -2From a_{13} to a_{18}: 1, 3, 2, -1, -3, -2Yes, it's definitely repeating every 6 terms. So, the period is 6.That means the sequence is periodic with period 6. So, every 6 terms, the sequence repeats.Now, since the sequence is periodic, the sum over each period is the same. So, if I can find the sum of one period, I can multiply it by the number of complete periods in 2017 terms and then add the sum of the remaining terms.First, let's compute the sum of one period (6 terms):Sum = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6Plugging in the values:Sum = 1 + 3 + 2 + (-1) + (-3) + (-2)Let's compute this step by step:1 + 3 = 44 + 2 = 66 + (-1) = 55 + (-3) = 22 + (-2) = 0So, the sum over each period of 6 terms is 0. That's interesting.Therefore, every 6 terms, the sum cancels out to 0. So, if 2017 is a multiple of 6, the sum would be 0. But 2017 divided by 6 is not an integer. Let's find out how many complete periods are in 2017 terms and how many terms are left over.To find the number of complete periods, we can perform integer division:2017 ÷ 6. Let's compute that.6 × 336 = 2016, so 336 complete periods account for 2016 terms. Then, there is 1 term left (since 2017 - 2016 = 1).So, S_{2017} = (Sum of 336 periods) + (Sum of the first 1 term of the next period)Since each period sums to 0, the sum of 336 periods is 0. Therefore, S_{2017} is just the sum of the first 1 term of the sequence.Looking back at the sequence, the first term is a_1 = 1. So, the sum of the first 1 term is 1.Hence, S_{2017} = 1.Wait, let me double-check my reasoning. So, the sequence repeats every 6 terms, each period sums to 0, so every multiple of 6 terms sums to 0. Then, 2017 is 6×336 +1, so the sum is equal to the sum of the first term, which is 1. That seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me verify with a smaller number. Let's compute S_6, which should be 0.S_6 = 1 + 3 + 2 + (-1) + (-3) + (-2) = 1 + 3 = 4; 4 + 2 = 6; 6 -1 =5; 5 -3=2; 2 -2=0. Correct.Similarly, S_7 should be S_6 + a_7 = 0 +1=1.Indeed, a_7 is 1, so S_7=1. Similarly, S_{13}= S_{12} + a_{13}=0 +1=1. So, every time we have a multiple of 6 plus 1, the sum is 1.Therefore, S_{2017}=1.I think that's solid. So, the answer is 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"A Protestant church is organizing an ecumenical event to bring together different Christian denominations. They plan to create a decorative mosaic that represents unity, using tiles of different shapes and colors. The mosaic design is a rectangle composed of square and triangular sections. 1. The area of the square section of the mosaic is represented by the polynomial ( A(x) = x^2 + 6x + 9 ). Find the dimensions of the square section by factoring the polynomial.2. To ensure that the area of the triangular section complements the design, the church wants the area of the triangular section to be exactly half of the square section's area. If the base of the triangular section is ( x + 3 ) units, find the height of the triangular section in terms of ( x ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a Protestant church organizing an ecumenical event, and they're creating a mosaic. The mosaic has a square section and a triangular section. There are two parts to the problem. Let me try to figure them out step by step.Starting with the first part: The area of the square section is given by the polynomial ( A(x) = x^2 + 6x + 9 ). I need to find the dimensions of the square section by factoring the polynomial. Hmm, okay, since it's a square, all sides are equal, so the area should be a perfect square trinomial. Let me recall how to factor that.A perfect square trinomial has the form ( (x + a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2 ). Comparing that to ( x^2 + 6x + 9 ), I can see that the middle term is 6x, which should be equal to 2ax. So, 2a = 6, which means a = 3. Then, the last term is 9, which is ( a^2 = 3^2 = 9 ). Perfect, that matches.So, factoring ( x^2 + 6x + 9 ) gives ( (x + 3)^2 ). Therefore, the area of the square section is ( (x + 3)^2 ), which means each side of the square is ( x + 3 ) units long. That makes sense because when you square ( x + 3 ), you get the area. So, the dimensions of the square section are ( x + 3 ) by ( x + 3 ).Alright, moving on to the second part. The church wants the area of the triangular section to be exactly half of the square section's area. The base of the triangular section is given as ( x + 3 ) units, and I need to find the height in terms of ( x ).First, let's recall the formula for the area of a triangle: ( text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} ). We know the area should be half of the square's area. The square's area is ( (x + 3)^2 ), so half of that is ( frac{1}{2}(x + 3)^2 ).Let me write that down:( text{Area of triangle} = frac{1}{2} times (x + 3)^2 )But we also know that the area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of its base and height:( text{Area of triangle} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} )Given that the base is ( x + 3 ), let's substitute that into the equation:( frac{1}{2} times (x + 3) times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times (x + 3)^2 )Hmm, okay, so we can set these two expressions equal to each other:( frac{1}{2}(x + 3) times text{height} = frac{1}{2}(x + 3)^2 )I can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fractions:( (x + 3) times text{height} = (x + 3)^2 )Now, I can divide both sides by ( x + 3 ) to solve for the height, assuming ( x + 3 neq 0 ) (which makes sense because the base can't be zero or negative in this context).So, dividing both sides by ( x + 3 ):( text{height} = frac{(x + 3)^2}{x + 3} )Simplifying the right side, ( (x + 3)^2 ) divided by ( x + 3 ) is just ( x + 3 ). So, the height is ( x + 3 ) units.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Area of square: ( (x + 3)^2 ).2. Area of triangle: half of that, so ( frac{1}{2}(x + 3)^2 ).3. Using triangle area formula: ( frac{1}{2} times (x + 3) times text{height} = frac{1}{2}(x + 3)^2 ).4. Multiply both sides by 2: ( (x + 3) times text{height} = (x + 3)^2 ).5. Divide both sides by ( x + 3 ): ( text{height} = x + 3 ).Yes, that all checks out. So, the height of the triangular section is ( x + 3 ) units.I wonder, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by expanding the area expressions?Let me try that. The area of the square is ( x^2 + 6x + 9 ). Half of that is ( frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x + frac{9}{2} ). The area of the triangle is ( frac{1}{2} times (x + 3) times h ). So, setting them equal:( frac{1}{2}(x + 3)h = frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x + frac{9}{2} )Multiply both sides by 2:( (x + 3)h = x^2 + 6x + 9 )Then, divide both sides by ( x + 3 ):( h = frac{x^2 + 6x + 9}{x + 3} )Factor the numerator:( h = frac{(x + 3)^2}{x + 3} = x + 3 )Same result. So, that confirms it. The height is indeed ( x + 3 ).Just to visualize, if the base is ( x + 3 ) and the height is also ( x + 3 ), the triangle would be an isoceles triangle with base equal to height. Interesting, but mathematically, it's consistent with the given area requirement.I think I'm confident with this answer. It makes sense that the height would be the same as the side of the square since the area of the triangle is half of the square's area, and the base is the same as the side length of the square. So, the height has to compensate by being equal to the base to achieve the required area.Yeah, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**1. The dimensions of the square section are boxed{x + 3} units.2. The height of the triangular section is boxed{x + 3} units."},{"question":"If ( a = 8^{53} ), ( b = 16^{41} ), and ( c = 64^{27} ), then which of the following inequalities is true?(A) ( a > b > c )(B) ( c > b > a )(C) ( b > a > c )(D) ( b > c > a )(E) ( c > a > b )","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to compare three numbers: ( a = 8^{53} ), ( b = 16^{41} ), and ( c = 64^{27} ). The question is asking which inequality is true among the options given. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that when comparing exponents with different bases and exponents, it's helpful to express them with the same base if possible. That way, I can more easily compare their sizes. Looking at the numbers 8, 16, and 64, I notice that they are all powers of 2. That seems promising because it means I can rewrite each of them with base 2, which should make the comparison easier.Let me write down each number as a power of 2:- 8 is equal to ( 2^3 ), so ( a = 8^{53} = (2^3)^{53} ).- 16 is equal to ( 2^4 ), so ( b = 16^{41} = (2^4)^{41} ).- 64 is equal to ( 2^6 ), so ( c = 64^{27} = (2^6)^{27} ).Okay, so now I can simplify each of these expressions by multiplying the exponents.Starting with ( a ):( (2^3)^{53} = 2^{3 times 53} ).Let me calculate ( 3 times 53 ). Hmm, 3 times 50 is 150, and 3 times 3 is 9, so 150 + 9 = 159. So, ( a = 2^{159} ).Next, ( b ):( (2^4)^{41} = 2^{4 times 41} ).Calculating ( 4 times 41 ). 4 times 40 is 160, and 4 times 1 is 4, so 160 + 4 = 164. So, ( b = 2^{164} ).Lastly, ( c ):( (2^6)^{27} = 2^{6 times 27} ).Calculating ( 6 times 27 ). Let's break it down: 6 times 20 is 120, and 6 times 7 is 42, so 120 + 42 = 162. So, ( c = 2^{162} ).Now, I have all three numbers expressed as powers of 2:- ( a = 2^{159} )- ( b = 2^{164} )- ( c = 2^{162} )Since all the bases are the same (base 2), the number with the largest exponent will be the largest number, and the one with the smallest exponent will be the smallest. So, I can compare the exponents directly.Looking at the exponents:- ( a ) has 159- ( b ) has 164- ( c ) has 162So, ordering them from largest to smallest exponent:164 (b) > 162 (c) > 159 (a)Therefore, the order of the numbers from largest to smallest is ( b > c > a ).Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.For ( a = 8^{53} ):- 8 is ( 2^3 ), so ( (2^3)^{53} = 2^{159} ). That seems correct.For ( b = 16^{41} ):- 16 is ( 2^4 ), so ( (2^4)^{41} = 2^{164} ). That also looks right.For ( c = 64^{27} ):- 64 is ( 2^6 ), so ( (2^6)^{27} = 2^{162} ). Yep, that's correct too.So, the exponents are 159, 164, and 162. So, 164 is the largest, followed by 162, then 159. Therefore, ( b > c > a ).Looking back at the options given:(A) ( a > b > c )(B) ( c > b > a )(C) ( b > a > c )(D) ( b > c > a )(E) ( c > a > b )So, the correct order is ( b > c > a ), which is option (D).Wait, just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by taking logarithms or something else. But since all the numbers are powers of 2, converting them to the same base was straightforward and should be accurate. Taking logarithms would essentially give the same result because the logarithm of a power is the exponent times the logarithm of the base, so it's proportional to the exponent. So, higher exponents correspond to higher logarithms, meaning the same order.Alternatively, I could think in terms of approximate values, but since these exponents are quite large, it's impractical to compute them directly. So, expressing them with the same base is definitely the way to go.Therefore, I'm confident that option (D) is correct: ( b > c > a ).**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"The principal of Greenfield High School is planning a field trip for 150 students and needs to arrange transportation using buses and vans. Each bus can carry 40 students, and each van can carry 10 students. The cost of renting a bus is 300, while the cost of renting a van is 80.1. If the principal wants to use at least one bus and one van, set up an inequality to determine the minimum number of buses and vans needed to transport all the students.2. Given that the principal has a budget limit of 1,200 for transportation, set up an equation to find how many buses and vans can be rented within this budget, ensuring that all students are accommodated.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about arranging transportation for 150 students using buses and vans. The principal wants to use at least one bus and one van. I need to set up some inequalities and equations to figure out the minimum number of buses and vans needed and also make sure it fits within a 1,200 budget. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, let's tackle part 1. The goal is to determine the minimum number of buses and vans needed to transport all 150 students, with the condition that at least one bus and one van are used. I think I need to set up an inequality here because we're dealing with a minimum requirement.Let me define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:- Let ( b ) be the number of buses.- Let ( v ) be the number of vans.Each bus can carry 40 students, so the total number of students that can be transported by buses is ( 40b ). Similarly, each van can carry 10 students, so the total number of students transported by vans is ( 10v ). Since we need to transport all 150 students, the sum of these two should be at least 150. So, the inequality would be:[ 40b + 10v geq 150 ]But wait, the problem also specifies that the principal wants to use at least one bus and one van. That means ( b geq 1 ) and ( v geq 1 ). So, I should include these constraints as well. However, the main inequality is the one about the total number of students. So, for part 1, the inequality is:[ 40b + 10v geq 150 ]But I should also note the constraints ( b geq 1 ) and ( v geq 1 ). Maybe I can write all of them together:[ 40b + 10v geq 150 ][ b geq 1 ][ v geq 1 ]I think that covers part 1. Now, moving on to part 2. The principal has a budget limit of 1,200. I need to set up an equation that finds how many buses and vans can be rented within this budget while still accommodating all students.First, let's think about the cost. Each bus costs 300, so the total cost for buses is ( 300b ). Each van costs 80, so the total cost for vans is ( 80v ). The total cost should not exceed 1,200. So, the cost equation is:[ 300b + 80v leq 1200 ]But we also need to make sure that all 150 students are accommodated, so we still have the previous inequality:[ 40b + 10v geq 150 ]And again, the principal wants to use at least one bus and one van, so ( b geq 1 ) and ( v geq 1 ).So, for part 2, the equation is the cost constraint:[ 300b + 80v leq 1200 ]But we also have the student transportation constraint and the non-negativity constraints. So, putting it all together, we have a system of inequalities:1. ( 40b + 10v geq 150 )2. ( 300b + 80v leq 1200 )3. ( b geq 1 )4. ( v geq 1 )But the question specifically asks to set up an equation for part 2, so maybe it's just the cost equation. However, to find the number of buses and vans, we might need to solve the system, but since it's just setting up the equation, I think the cost inequality is sufficient.Wait, but in part 2, it says \\"set up an equation to find how many buses and vans can be rented within this budget, ensuring that all students are accommodated.\\" Hmm, so maybe it's not just the cost equation but also considering the student transportation. So, perhaps it's a system of equations or inequalities.But the question says \\"set up an equation,\\" so maybe they just want the cost equation. Let me double-check. It says, \\"set up an equation to find how many buses and vans can be rented within this budget, ensuring that all students are accommodated.\\" So, maybe it's combining both constraints into one equation? Or perhaps it's a system of equations.Wait, actually, equations are equalities, but here we have inequalities because we're dealing with minimums and maximums. So, maybe it's better to present both inequalities together as a system. But the question says \\"set up an equation,\\" so perhaps they just want the cost constraint as an equation. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.Alternatively, maybe they want the cost equation in terms of the number of buses and vans, which is ( 300b + 80v leq 1200 ). So, that's an inequality, not an equation. But the question says \\"set up an equation.\\" Maybe they mean an equation that represents the budget, but in reality, it's an inequality because it's a maximum.Wait, perhaps they mean to set up an equation that combines both the transportation and the budget. But that would be a system of inequalities. I'm a bit confused here. Let me re-read the question.\\"Given that the principal has a budget limit of 1,200 for transportation, set up an equation to find how many buses and vans can be rented within this budget, ensuring that all students are accommodated.\\"Hmm, so they want an equation that, when solved, will give the number of buses and vans that fit within the budget and can carry all students. So, perhaps it's a system of equations, but since we have inequalities, it's a system of inequalities.But the question specifically says \\"set up an equation,\\" so maybe they just want the cost equation as an inequality. Alternatively, maybe they want to express one variable in terms of the other.Wait, perhaps they want to express the number of vans in terms of buses or vice versa, using the budget constraint. Let me try that.From the cost inequality:[ 300b + 80v leq 1200 ]We can solve for ( v ):[ 80v leq 1200 - 300b ][ v leq frac{1200 - 300b}{80} ][ v leq 15 - 3.75b ]But since ( v ) has to be an integer (you can't rent a fraction of a van), we can write:[ v leq leftlfloor 15 - 3.75b rightrfloor ]But I don't know if that's what they're asking for. Alternatively, maybe they just want the inequality as is.Wait, maybe I should also consider the student transportation inequality and combine it with the budget constraint. So, we have two inequalities:1. ( 40b + 10v geq 150 )2. ( 300b + 80v leq 1200 )And ( b geq 1 ), ( v geq 1 ).So, perhaps the answer for part 2 is this system of inequalities. But the question says \\"set up an equation,\\" which is a bit confusing because we're dealing with inequalities. Maybe they meant \\"set up an inequality\\" or \\"set up a system of inequalities.\\" But since the question says \\"equation,\\" I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe they want to express one variable in terms of the other using the budget constraint and then substitute into the student transportation inequality. Let me try that.From the budget constraint:[ 300b + 80v = 1200 ] (assuming the budget is exactly used, but it's actually a maximum, so it's ( leq ))But if we set it as an equation, ( 300b + 80v = 1200 ), then we can solve for ( v ):[ 80v = 1200 - 300b ][ v = frac{1200 - 300b}{80} ][ v = 15 - 3.75b ]But since ( v ) must be an integer, and ( b ) must also be an integer, we can look for integer solutions where ( v ) is also an integer.But I'm not sure if this is what the question is asking. It says \\"set up an equation to find how many buses and vans can be rented within this budget, ensuring that all students are accommodated.\\" So, perhaps it's better to present the system of inequalities as the answer.Wait, but the question specifically says \\"set up an equation,\\" so maybe they just want the cost equation, which is ( 300b + 80v leq 1200 ). That's an inequality, but since they said \\"equation,\\" maybe they meant inequality. Sometimes people use \\"equation\\" loosely to mean \\"expression.\\"Alternatively, maybe they want to express the number of vans in terms of buses or vice versa. Let me think.If I solve the student transportation inequality for ( v ):[ 40b + 10v geq 150 ][ 10v geq 150 - 40b ][ v geq 15 - 4b ]But since ( v geq 1 ), this gives us a lower bound on ( v ).Similarly, from the budget constraint:[ 300b + 80v leq 1200 ][ 80v leq 1200 - 300b ][ v leq 15 - 3.75b ]So, combining these two, we have:[ 15 - 4b leq v leq 15 - 3.75b ]But since ( v ) must be an integer, we can look for integer values of ( b ) and ( v ) that satisfy both inequalities.But again, I'm not sure if this is what the question is asking. It just says \\"set up an equation,\\" so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.Let me go back to the original questions.1. Set up an inequality to determine the minimum number of buses and vans needed to transport all the students, using at least one bus and one van.So, for part 1, the inequality is ( 40b + 10v geq 150 ) with ( b geq 1 ) and ( v geq 1 ).2. Given the budget limit, set up an equation to find how many buses and vans can be rented within this budget, ensuring all students are accommodated.So, for part 2, the equation is the budget constraint: ( 300b + 80v leq 1200 ), along with the student transportation inequality ( 40b + 10v geq 150 ) and the constraints ( b geq 1 ) and ( v geq 1 ).But since the question says \\"set up an equation,\\" maybe they just want the budget constraint as an equation, even though it's actually an inequality. Or perhaps they want the system of equations/inequalities.I think the safest way is to present both inequalities for part 2, as they are both necessary to solve the problem.So, summarizing:1. The inequality for the number of students is ( 40b + 10v geq 150 ), with ( b geq 1 ) and ( v geq 1 ).2. The budget constraint is ( 300b + 80v leq 1200 ), along with the student transportation inequality ( 40b + 10v geq 150 ) and ( b geq 1 ), ( v geq 1 ).But since the question for part 2 specifically asks for an equation, I'm a bit confused. Maybe they just want the budget equation, which is ( 300b + 80v leq 1200 ).Alternatively, perhaps they want to express the number of vans in terms of buses using the budget constraint. Let me try that.From ( 300b + 80v leq 1200 ), solving for ( v ):[ 80v leq 1200 - 300b ][ v leq frac{1200 - 300b}{80} ][ v leq 15 - 3.75b ]But since ( v ) must be an integer, we can write ( v leq lfloor 15 - 3.75b rfloor ).Similarly, from the student transportation inequality:[ 40b + 10v geq 150 ][ 10v geq 150 - 40b ][ v geq 15 - 4b ]So, combining these two, we have:[ 15 - 4b leq v leq 15 - 3.75b ]But since ( v ) must be an integer, we can look for integer values of ( b ) such that ( 15 - 4b leq 15 - 3.75b ), which simplifies to:[ -4b leq -3.75b ][ -4b + 3.75b leq 0 ][ -0.25b leq 0 ][ b geq 0 ]Which is always true since ( b geq 1 ).So, for each integer ( b geq 1 ), ( v ) must satisfy:[ lceil 15 - 4b rceil leq v leq lfloor 15 - 3.75b rfloor ]But this might be more detailed than what the question is asking for.In conclusion, for part 1, the inequality is ( 40b + 10v geq 150 ) with ( b geq 1 ) and ( v geq 1 ). For part 2, the budget constraint is ( 300b + 80v leq 1200 ), along with the student transportation inequality and the non-negativity constraints.I think that's the best I can do. Maybe I should present both inequalities for part 2 as a system."},{"question":"Given that m is a root of the equation x^{2}-2x-3=0 with respect to x, find m^{2}-2m+2023.","answer":"First, I recognize that ( m ) is a root of the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 ).

Using the value I found for ( m^2 - 2m ), I substitute it into the expression:[m^2 - 2m + 2023 = 3 + 2023 = 2026]Therefore, the value of ( m^2 - 2m + 2023 ) is 2026."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},_={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},F=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function H(a,e,h,u,s,n){const d=p("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 DeepSeek-R1 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",_,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>s.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[g,s.searchQuery]])]),t("div",z,[(i(!0),o(y,null,x(n.filteredPoems,(r,f)=>(i(),w(d,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...r))},[s.isLoading?(i(),o("span",N,"Loading...")):(i(),o("span",M,"See more"))],8,F)):v("",!0)])}const P=m(C,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-f3d9d538"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/32.md","filePath":"drive/32.md"}'),D={name:"drive/32.md"},E=Object.assign(D,{setup(a){return(e,h)=>(i(),o("div",null,[q(P)]))}});export{j as __pageData,E as default};
